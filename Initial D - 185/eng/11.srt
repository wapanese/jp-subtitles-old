00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,750

<i>It's not as if there isn't</i>

<i>Let's warp past these boring things</i>

<i>And go straight to our reason for living</i>

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,540
<i>That's our law!</i>

31
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,630
I mean, look at this Eight-Six
with its ugly wheels.

32
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,100
It's embarrassing!

33
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,430
I'm crying!

34
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,040
I never thought anyone would be
driving an Eight-Five in this day and age!

35
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,060
It suits you well, though, kid!

36
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,410
Don't let any scooters tailgate you!

37
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,020
That's it! They're gonna pay!

38
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,720
Here we go!

39
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,930
Takumi! Ohh! Ohhh!

40
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,430
P... Please...

41
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,670
Take good care of my Eight-Five!

42
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,660
"Act 11: Shingo Arrives!"

43
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,740
It's not worth it, Takumi!

44
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,250
Ta... Takumi...

45
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,360
Slow down, Takumi!

46
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,820
You nailed it!

47
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,040
What the heck?

48
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,950
Hey, that car's right on our tail!

49
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,050
It must be some Akina punk.

50
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,880
You picked the wrong cars to tailgate!

51
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,590
I see...

52
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,680
Wanna play with us?

53
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,980
That's enough, Takumi!

54
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,310
Stop the car!

55
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,020
"Curve ahead"

56
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,200
I said stop!

57
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,560
Takumi!!

58
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,350
Unbelievable...

59
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,580
Is this really my Eight-Five?

60
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,160
He is not bad at all...

61
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,960
No way!

62
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,500
Isn't that the Eight-Five?

63
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,340
The one we saw at the pass?

64
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,640
There's no way an Eight-Five
could keep up with us!

65
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,550
You're right! It's that Eight-Five!

66
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,580
Those punks lied to us!

67
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,990
It must be...

68
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,490
...an Eight-Six!

69
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,480
<i>Here it is!</i>

70
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,330
<i>What?</i>

71
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,660
<i>It won't accelerate down the hill at all...</i>

72
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:44,700
<i>And these wheels won't grip the road at all...</i>

73
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,280
Darn, he is so fast!

74
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,940
<i>This is so slow.</i>

75
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,180
<i>I guess it's time for that move.</i>

76
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,210
You won't pass me, no matter what!

77
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,310
What?!

78
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,420
What just happened?!

79
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,860
How did he pass me?

80
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,700
That's not an Eight-Five.

81
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,730
That's an Eight-Six!

82
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,260
A well-tuned Eight-Six...

83
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,370
What a big roll!

84
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,840
Was it...

85
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,000
...an Eight-Five?

86
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,290
He went right through us.

87
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,190
That Eight-Five was spooky!

88
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,890
Was it...

89
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,460
...a ghost?!

90
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,570
- Want a coffee?
- Yeah.

91
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,910
--Here.
--Thank you.

92
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:36,020
Iketani told me... that your
downhill skills were abnormal.

93
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,690
Abnormal?

94
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,490
I don't think so...

95
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,520
You just can't see it yourself.

96
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,590
I never imagined that a car could run like that.

97
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:55,400
You've changed my perception.
It was that shocking.

98
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,770
I'm sorry it was so scary for you.

99
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,910
No need for an apology, Takumi.

100
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,450
I've never been this happy before!

101
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,650
Huh?

102
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,790
I realized that it wasn't all
about the car's capabilities.

103
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:17,690
If you have skills, you can even
maneuver an Eight-Five like that.

104
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:23,130
I fell in love with my car!
I'll take good care of it.

105
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,330
I'll train hard, starting tomorrow.

106
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,540
I don't care if people laugh at me.

107
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,670
My Eight-Five is the best!

108
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:44,650
Hey, let's go for a drive with
a couple of girls next time!

109
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,560
--Sure...
--No blowing me off this time, okay?

110
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,230
--I mean it, Takumi!
--I promise.

111
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,820
The ocean, the girls, the bikinis...here I come!

112
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,270
All right!!

113
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,520
My S13!

114
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,130
You came back to me... as handsome as ever.

115
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,630
I'm going to cry...

116
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,890
--Are you trying to run over me, Itsuki?
--All right!!

117
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,670
We'll start training today!

118
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,540
We'll practice drifting with lower-grade tires.

119
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,640
Count me in, too!

120
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,840
Check out this cool sticker!

121
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,810
What...?!

122
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,350
It's all right, isn't it?

123
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,320
Yeah, sure, not bad...

124
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,420
Now I'm officially a member
of Team Speed Stars!

125
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,490
--The sticker looks crooked.
--Take it off...

126
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:01,400
I should practice before I forget Takumi's
downhill techniques from last night.

127
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,200
What?! He let you in his Eight-Six?

128
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,870
He sure did...

129
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,670
...though it wasn't the Eight-Six.

130
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,670
What's with the meaningful laugh?

131
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,840
--Confess, Itsuki!
--Should I tell you?

132
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,580
--Wanna drink gasoline?
--Okay, I'll tell you!

133
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,550
Well, he drove my Eight-Five

134
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,750
at the Akina downhill last night.

135
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,760
It was beyond my imagination!

136
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,090
I've never seen anything like it!

137
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:34,930
Even way before a corner,
we were drifting sideways.

138
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:39,370
All I could see was the blur
of scenery in the windshield.

139
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,240
It was miraculous!

140
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,600
He drifted with your Eight-Five?

141
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,940
It doesn't even have LSD!

142
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,040
It was so quick.

143
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,040
We passed two jerks back to back

144
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,380
at the downhill hairpin turns.

145
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,780
I've never felt so alive!

146
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,220
Do you believe him, boss?

147
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,260
I know Takumi is good, but with an Eight-Five?

148
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,490
It's hard to believe that any driver

149
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,730
could do that in an Eight-Five.

150
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,770
I know it's hard to believe,

151
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:15,270
but I saw what I saw.

152
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,610
If Itsuki is telling the truth,

153
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:22,110
that means that Takumi's adaptability

154
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,710
is far beyond what I imagined.

155
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,050
Since they both have the same body,

156
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,520
maybe they have similar maneuverability?

157
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,950
I doubt that.

158
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,950
That Eight-Five is a joke,

159
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,590
compared to the Eight-Six Bunta has built

160
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,530
and modified over the years.

161
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,430
A joke?!

162
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,930
You mean, Takumi can
drive pretty much any car?

163
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,740
Just as long as they have the FR layout,

164
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,910
he can bring out their full potential.

165
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,750
Not just anyone can drive an Eight-Six.

166
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,880
You have to have mastered
the basic skills to drive one.

167
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,350
Bunta used to say...

168
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,320
"An Eight-Six trains the driver."

169
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:39,690
That car... had a Night Kids sticker on it.

170
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,090
It had street racing written all over it.

171
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,190
You can totally tell modified cars from others

172
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,560
by looking at how they run.

173
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,030
Yeah.

174
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:55,200
Lately, those Night Kids come to Akina a lot.

175
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,940
What do they want?

176
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,980
Well, since their leader Nakazato lost,

177
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,550
I don't think anyone from their team

178
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,070
will come out for a rematch.

179
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,100
I almost feel bad for him.

180
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,270
Now that Takeshi has lost to that Eight-Six,

181
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,270
he can't act all invincible anymore.

182
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,000
May I help you?

183
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,440
--Two coffees.
--Sure.

184
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,510
I heard that the Eight-Six driver
in the Speed Stars is just a kid.

185
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,250
I don't know how good this kid is...

186
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,920
...but when I beat that Eight-Six,

187
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,620
I'll be better than Takeshi.

188
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,860
I'll be the fastest one in Night Kids.

189
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,360
I don't know, Shingo.

190
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,530
I know you're fast downhill,

191
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,560
but I've heard this kid is abnormal.

192
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,300
I know I can take him fair and square,

193
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,300
but I have a more interesting idea,

194
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,310
which will ensure my victory.

195
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,810
Wha...?!

196
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:12,680
You'll see. I'll show him an
impressively dangerous downhill.

197
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,850
The world only needs one downhill specialist.

198
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,690
The Eight-Six is outdated.

199
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:24,590
I'll make sure to send it to a scrap yard.

200
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,530
Wha...

201
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,760
Shingo Shoji of Night Kids...

202
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,200
...is the fastest downhill racer in Gunma.

203
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,360
Where is Ryosuke?

204
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,030
My brother is locked in his room,

205
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,630
staring at his computer screen.

206
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,730
He sure likes doing that.

207
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,900
He's the only street racer in Gunma

208
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,530
who trains by staring at a computer screen.

209
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,380
I wonder what would happen if my brother

210
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,380
and the Eight-Six of Mount Akina raced?

211
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,880
There is no way Ryosuke would lose to him.

212
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:30,760
Ryosuke knows all about that Eight-Six now.

213
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,430
I'm sure he has all the data he needs

214
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,870
to create a simulation of
a winning race in his head.

215
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,770
No street racer knows more
about cars than my brother.

216
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,940
I can't imagine him losing,

217
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,180
considering his exceptional skills.

218
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,180
Well, then...

219
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,020
But that Eight-Six won't lose, either.

220
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,290
That high-speed drifting...

221
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,990
...and his delicate brake control.

222
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,960
He's exceptional, too.

223
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,560
As a fellow FR driver,

224
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,540
I may have fallen for the
way that Eight-Six runs.

225
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,040
Keisuke...

226
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,640
If they race, one will lose.

227
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,180
I don't want my brother to lose,

228
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:26,210
but I don't want to see
that Eight-Six lose, either.

229
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,410
Strange, isn't it?

230
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,590
Oh, sorry!

231
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,660
--Did you get wet?
--No.

232
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,160
--Hold on...
--Sure.

233
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,320
Why don't we go somewhere together again?

234
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,930
We can go to the mountains,

235
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,940
or the highlands, or the ocean.

236
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,200
--We're on summer vacation!
--Yeah...

237
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,080
Let's make a lot of memories!

238
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,350
We should.

239
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,880
Takumi, I wouldn't mind going with you...

240
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,010
...on an overnight trip.

241
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:17,030
When is your next day off? This Sunday?

242
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,700
It depends, really...

243
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,230
Do you want to take me for a drive again then?

244
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:29,040
--With that car?
--Yeah.

245
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,150
No blowing me off this time, Takumi!

246
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:40,090
Do you mind if Itsuki joins us?

247
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,420
The three of us?

248
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,430
I was hoping...

249
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,830
...you could find someone for him.

250
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,400
Yeah...

251
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,000
He's a good guy, but he's shy.

252
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,370
I didn't know you were so thoughtful.

253
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:02,310
I just thought it would be good for him...

254
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,150
Thank you very much!

255
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,550
Sure, I'll ask around.

256
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,790
Thanks.

257
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:16,220
I'm sure I'll find someone perfect for Itsuki.

258
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,090
That was awesome!

259
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,320
Maybe I should try it, too.

260
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,060
I'm getting the hang of
moving the rear sideways.

261
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,260
It's all about the timing.

262
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:02,470
You pull the emergency brake to start the drift.

263
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,200
But, Iketani...

264
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,040
I didn't see Takumi pull the emergency brake

265
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,140
even once the other night.

266
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,380
Takumi uses the foot pedal brake

267
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,120
to shift the weight.

268
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,950
Don't worry, you're a long way from that!

269
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,050
Yeah...

270
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:23,160
We usually go into a
corner and then accelerate

271
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,990
to skid the rear tires right before coming out,

272
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,530
but that's an elementary
technique called Power Slide

273
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,400
and is not a true drift.

274
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:38,240
"Keiichi Tsuchiya's Drift Lesson"

275
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,870
Takumi drifts into a corner
and controls the skid at the end

276
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,740
to stabilize the car--a true drift.

277
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,480
That's the fastest way to turn,
and it looks good, too.

278
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,480
I see. You've done some research.

279
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,020
I was bored while my S13 was in the shop,

280
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,590
so I read some books.

281
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,330
I wanna try the sidespin, too.

282
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,330
I'm so excited!

283
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:04,230
I think I'm ready for the next step.

284
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,070
Instead of a straight line,

285
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,270
I'll try it in a low-speed turn.

286
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,030
Good luck, Iketani!

287
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,410
Watch out for other cars!

288
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,400
