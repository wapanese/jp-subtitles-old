00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,150
<i>It's not as if there isn't</i>

<i>Let's warp past these boring things</i>

29
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,480
<i>And go straight to our reason for living</i>

30
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,510
<i>That's our law!</i>

31
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,760
No cars ahead!

32
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,460
Make it flashy, Mako!

33
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,590
--Yeah!
--Go!

34
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,640
He couldn't have!

35
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,550
We already knew how great he was.

36
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,240
But since this is my last race...

37
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:40,260
...we can't quit without giving it our best!

38
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,090
What are you, scared?!

39
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,260
You're useless!

40
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,360
You're nothing but dead weight.

41
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,170
--Dead weight?!
--You're ballast,

42
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,100
messing up the power-to-weight ratio!

43
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,100
<i>She gets tough behind the wheel!</i>

44
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,440
I'm not ballast!

45
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,780
I'm not fat! I have a nice body!

46
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,110
Forty-nine kilograms of extra weight!

47
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,410
I weigh 47!

48
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,210
Fine, I've got my pride, too!

49
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,960
Ready, Mako?

50
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,060
We'll put our lives on the line!

51
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,030
Welcome back!

52
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,700
All right. Enter the next turn so
you almost scrape the inside wall!

53
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,600
Got it!

54
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:53,720
"Act 19: Super Drift"

55
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,090
--Goodnight, Papa.
--'Night.

56
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,940
Natsuki?

57
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,140
When will I see you again?

58
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,410
I'm not sure. School starts soon...

59
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,280
<i>Natsuki...</i>

60
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,170
The next turn looks sandy.

61
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,010
--Hug the inside!
--Got it!

62
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,690
No cars ahead! Drift through it!

63
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,810
<i>I couldn't be my usual self</i>

64
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,010
<i>because I was too conscious of him.</i>

65
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,550
<i>Deep down, I believed that no racer</i>

66
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,010
<i>could follow us, no matter how great he was.</i>

67
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,750
<i>But now I see.</i>

68
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,660
<i>I can't race well if my attention</i>
<i>is on what's behind me.</i>

69
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,930
<i>I'll never look back again.</i>

70
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,690
Drift here!

71
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,280
There can't be many turns left.

72
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,550
Yeah.

73
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,220
I wonder if he's still chasing her?

74
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,250
To be honest, I thought the
race would end a lot sooner.

75
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,590
No way!

76
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,260
Even if he can't pass her this time,

77
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,430
he'll win the next race.

78
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,100
He can't pass her.

79
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,760
I'm amazed he's still in the race.

80
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,260
He just had to be the cat on this new course.

81
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,580
Wow, it started!

82
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,120
My name is Mako Sato.

83
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,760
Call me!

84
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,160
Sorry about that...

85
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,600
To make this summer memorable,

86
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,500
I would like to race
Akina's Eight-Six at Usui Pass.

87
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,900
That's my wish.

88
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,740
In return for my wish...

89
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,300
...I'll give you my virginity.

90
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,160
Iketani!

91
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
What?

92
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,160
You were spacing out.

93
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,960
It's so obvious that you
were thinking about Mako.

94
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,030
It's not like that!

95
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,870
No need to hide it.

96
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,500
I have to admit that she's a cool girl.

97
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,140
Kenji...

98
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,310
I don't know the details,

99
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,520
but after this race,
you should give it another try.

100
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,850
You'd be a fool to let her go so easily.

101
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,510
I don't care.

102
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,140
Drift here!

103
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,070
There's a car ahead,

104
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,900
but it's still three turns away,

105
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,670
so enter this turn at full speed!

106
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,070
Okay, Sayuki.

107
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,920
Get ready for the car.

108
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,070
It sounds like a race.

109
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,100
Really? I wanna see!

110
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,370
Their downhill technique will
show you how good they are.

111
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,750
Amazing...

112
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,730
I called it!

113
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,600
<i>Sayuki can time oncoming traffic perfectly.</i>

114
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,840
<i>She can spot the distant headlights</i>
<i>flashing through the leaves.</i>

115
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,810
"Grip" and stay inside!

116
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,650
<i>Good job, Mako. You're right on.</i>

117
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,650
Drift right through here!

118
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,350
No cars ahead! Drift again!

119
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,870
<i>Amazing. Maybe too amazing...</i>

120
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:44,670
<i>Good racers always leave room for error.</i>

121
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,910
<i>It may look like they're exceeding their limits,</i>

122
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,750
<i>but they only use full</i>
<i>"wheel grip"when exiting a turn.</i>

123
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:57,420
<i>They ease up on the "wheel grip"</i>
<i>when braking into a turn,</i>

124
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:02,080
<i>because one mistake on an</i>
<i>unforgiving course means a crash.</i>

125
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,160
<i>But...</i>

126
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,000
<i>...she has no margin for error right now.</i>

127
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,490
<i>She is too focused to even realize it.</i>

128
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,210
<i>Should I mention it to her...</i>

129
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,910
<i>...or not?</i>

130
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,750
<i>It's my job to let her know.</i>

131
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,370
<i>However...</i>

132
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:51,540
<i>...I don't want to say anything</i>
<i>to mess up her perfect run.</i>

133
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,110
<i>I've decided.</i>

134
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,610
<i>We're the best team.</i>

135
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,810
<i>How can I not believe in her?</i>

136
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,580
<i>This is her best race ever.</i>

137
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,800
<i>Man, what a charge!</i>

138
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,010
<i>She picked up the pace again.</i>

139
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,980
<i>Any faster, and I'll exceed my limit.</i>

140
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:35,280
<i>Even now, I'm barely in control,</i>
<i>abusing all four tires...</i>

141
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,950
<i>Darn, I may not make it...</i>

142
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,950
This is our last chance to shake him off.

143
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,050
I know.

144
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,890
No cars ahead! Go for it!

145
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,980
<i>He's not following...</i>

146
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,710
<i>Why not?</i>

147
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,710
Mako, you're going in too sharp!

148
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,670
We can't recover! Spin away from him!

149
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,070
<i>Oh, man!</i>

150
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,130
<i>Please don't hit us!</i>

151
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,350
--We're saved.
--Brilliant.

152
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,000
We lost.

153
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,700
He's so skilled...

154
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,720
...that I almost hate him.

155
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,800
How do you feel?

156
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,240
We lost...

157
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,540
...but I feel very satisfied.

158
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:32,640
It reminded me of the excitement
I felt when I first started racing.

159
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,500
We would practice until sunrise.

160
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,990
That same pure sensation...

161
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,910
You went too far at the end,

162
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,580
but you were great until then.

163
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,280
The best race ever.

164
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,120
Sayuki...

165
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,260
Whatever you decide to do from now on,

166
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,850
just know that you have my blessing.

167
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,930
Thanks, Sayuki.

168
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,600
No need for tears, Mako.

169
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,800
Let's just enjoy this glorious moment.

170
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,450
They're back!

171
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,490
I wonder how the race went?

172
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:49,500
You think they're going again?

173
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,120
Probably...

174
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,270
Takumi!

175
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,750
Takumi...

176
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,950
I find it hard to believe, but...

177
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,850
I guess we won't need the second race, huh?

178
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,590
No second race. It's all over.

179
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,430
I knew it.

180
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,670
Even for Takumi...

181
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:32,540
No... I didn't want to see him lose like this.

182
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,810
We lost.

183
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,980
Come again?

184
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,220
What did you just say?

185
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,290
I said we lost.

186
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,320
Don't make me repeat it.

187
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,290
He's the winner.

188
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,520
What?!

189
00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:02,700
--Yay!
--Wow!

190
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:13,850
I never imagined we could
lose on our own turf.

191
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:18,890
All I did was follow you,
and I barely did that,

192
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:22,390
so I don't think I really won the race.

193
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,760
Don't be so modest.

194
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,220
With your skills, you have
the right to rub it in.

195
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,930
But...

196
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,670
We've put in hours of practice here,

197
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,370
so we were very confident.

198
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:40,410
You chose to chase us,

199
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,010
and we couldn't shake you off.

200
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,410
We accept our defeat, right, Mako?

201
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,950
Yeah.

202
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,780
<i>Mako...</i>

203
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,960
That was by far the best race ever.

204
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,690
Thanks.

205
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,240
You're blushing big time.

206
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,980
You're a mystery.

207
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,550
Your racing ability is extraordinary,

208
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,920
but otherwise you barely seem ordinary.

209
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,120
This is how he usually is.

210
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,920
When he's not racing,

211
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,490
we can't tell if he's awake or asleep.

212
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,660
Hey, thanks a lot.

213
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,460
Itsuki's right, though.

214
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:39,660
Anyhow, I'm amazed how
young and good you really are.

215
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,010
<i>You should give it another try.</i>

216
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:50,340
<i>You'd be a fool to let her go so easily.</i>

217
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,150
Iketani.

218
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,660
Thank you for tonight...

219
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:08,100
Mako, I...

220
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,460
Don't be depressed, Iketani!

221
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,700
Racers don't need girls, right?

222
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,670
Right...

223
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:32,690
<i>Actually, he has a really adorable face.</i>

224
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:36,490
Hey, what's your name, anyway?

225
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:41,500
--Takumi Fujiwara...
--Itsuki Takeuchi, 18!

226
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,630
I'm an Aries and type O,
and my favorite car is...

227
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:48,330
I don't think I asked you...

228
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,510
Anyway, since we're friends now,

229
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,380
how about going swimming
together sometime?

230
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,580
That sounds great!

231
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,580
Kenji?

232
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,490
--Sure.
--How about you, Takumi?

233
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,660
--Yeah...
--You, too, Iketani?

234
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:15,150
Yay! Thank you, Sayuki!

235
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:22,690
Let's go wild and crazy with my Eight-Five!

236
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:40,350
<i>There was a time when I</i>
<i>wandered aimlessly, tired of love</i>

237
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:48,200
<i>I lost sight of myself and gave in to desire</i>

238
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,600
<i>But destiny is ever-changing</i>

239
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:02,240
<i>And charmed by innocent eyes</i>

240
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:10,150
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I hold you ever so tightly</i>

241
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:16,960
<i>All I can say is that I believe</i>
<i>my feelings are true</i>

242
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,130
<i>Let's enjoy our happiness...</i>

243
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:29,230
<i>Into our shining future</i>

244
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:48,860
<i>We'll prove countless times...</i>

245
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:54,930
<i>Our passion will last for eternity!</i>

246
00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:01,600
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I embrace you ever so tightly</i>

247
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:08,440
<i>Even if I lose everything that I have,</i>
<i>I will never let you go</i>

248
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,680
<i>Bloom, my beautiful...</i>

249
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:20,050
<i>...and miraculous flower</i>

250
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,030
<i>If men weren't honest with themselves,</i>

251
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,870
<i>mankind would've been extinct long ago.</i>

252
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,700
<i>You're right, boss!</i>

253
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,140
<i>The beginning of a relationship is important.</i>

254
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,400
<i>Make sure that you don't...</i>

255
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,250
<i>Hi, Honey. I'm on my way...</i>

256
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,250
<i>Leaving, boss? Make sure you don't what?</i>

257
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,990
<i>Next on Initial D: "The End of Summer."</i>

258
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,580
<i>Make sure you don't miss it!</i>
