--Whew! I'm beat!
--Ooh... That was rough...

32
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,060
Why do we have to practice so hard?

33
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,030
--I'm starving. Let's get some pizza!
--Count me in!

34
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,870
For real? With Natsuki Mogi?

35
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:51,370
Now that is one fine babe.
Everyone wants a piece of that booty!

36
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,740
Yeah, well, she'll do whatever I tell her to.

37
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,410
It's time I broke her in.

38
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,910
What do you mean, "break her in"?

39
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,520
You know what he means!

40
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,820
Girls are all the same.

41
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,550
They act like they don't want it at first,
but then they come around.

42
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,220
The other day I called her up to the roof, and...

43
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,830
"Locker"

44
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,320
I think it's time you shut
the hell up, before I make you!

45
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,700
Just who do you think you are?!

46
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,740
The little squirt doesn't know his place!

47
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,100
Cut it out, Takumi!

48
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,570
I've had enough of listening to you bastards!

49
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,740
Why, you little...!

50
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,510
--Back off, Takumi!
--You punk!

51
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:01,570
"Act 7: A Racer's Pride"

52
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,350
<i>You're rude, Takumi.</i>

53
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,920
<i>When a person has a cute girl with him,</i>

54
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,230
<i>do you think he should be off</i>
<i>in his own little world? Really!</i>

55
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,220
<i>I just asked if you have a girl you like.</i>

56
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,760
<i>I have someone I can't help thinking of a little.</i>

57
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,620
Iketani! Hey! Where'd Iketani go?

58
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,620
Iketani?

59
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,620
Oh, you mean Iketani, whose terrifying
screams echoed across Mt. Akina

60
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,400
as he rocketed down the dangerous
three-corner road and passed out!

61
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,270
That Iketani just left on a delivery.
He took the pickup truck.

62
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:02,500
Oh... If Iketani's not here,
then maybe you can help, Takumi.

63
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,040
Could you deliver some papers
to the Yamada shop for me?

64
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,740
You can take my car.

65
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,800
Uh, sure.

66
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,480
Hey, boss. Um...

67
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,220
You know, I have a license, too.

68
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,690
Why do you always ask Iketani
and Takumi to run errands?

69
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,560
Well, you see... put your hand on
your chest and tell me what you feel.

70
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,060
--Now do you understand?
--No...

71
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,100
Simply put, I can trust
Iketani and Takumi to drive.

72
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,440
As for you, though...

73
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,240
...you'd bring my car back with a
dent the size of your caved-in chest.

74
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,580
Well, there you have it.

75
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,910
<i>You just wait and see.</i>

76
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,110
<i>Once I get my own Eight-Six,</i>
<i>I'm gonna be the fastest racer around...</i>

77
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,920
<i>Whoa, an R32!</i>

78
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,020
Welcome, sir!

79
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,760
<i>What a ride! The R32's the bomb!</i>

80
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,890
<i>N-Night Kids!</i>

81
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,240
Hey, kid. My name's Nakazato.

82
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,310
Someone back on my turf
told me I could contact

83
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,710
a member of the Speed Stars at this station.

84
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,990
Tell me this. When can I find
that Eight-Six at Akina?

85
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,660
Do you understand what I'm saying?

86
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,390
Aren't you a member of the Speed Stars?

87
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:38,170
<i>Me... a member of the Speed Stars... Cool...</i>

88
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,700
I guess I came to the wrong place.

89
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,940
Wait! No, you're at the right place!

90
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,080
Actually, that Eight-Six guy and me,
we're down like brothers.

91
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,510
What?!

92
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,380
Yeah, people call us the Eight-Six Duo.

93
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,350
We're the fastest down-hillers on our team.

94
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,350
Really?

95
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:03,020
Yeah, well... actually, he may be
a bit faster than me, but still...

96
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,490
I didn't know anyone on the
Speed Stars could race at that level...

97
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,700
Yeah, um... Well, never mind that.

98
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,970
Say, I can deliver him a message if you want.

99
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,340
After all, he's my bro.

100
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,680
All right. Tell him this.

101
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,340
10 o'clock this Saturday night.

102
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,910
10 o'clock this Saturday night...?

103
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,990
Nakazato of the Night Kids will be
waiting for him on top of Mt. Akina.

104
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,760
Waiting on top of Mt. Akina... What?!

105
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,990
It'll be a race to the bottom!

106
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,430
Wait! That's a... Hey!

107
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,860
Uh, you know... Wait a second, please!

108
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,160
Hey, wai...

109
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,200
<i>Oh, now I've really done it!</i>

110
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,600
<i>Did he just challenge Takumi?</i>

111
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,410
Oh, no! What am I going to tell Takumi?!

112
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,580
Takumi!

113
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,950
What are you all panicked about?

114
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,380
Never mind that.

115
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:09,120
Say, if you're free this Saturday,
you want to go racing at Mt. Akina?

116
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,290
--No.
--Why not?

117
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:16,900
Sorry, but I don't drive a car
unless it's absolutely necessary.

118
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,200
Takumi!

119
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,640
Thanks a lot. Come on in and have some coffee.

120
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,540
Okay.

121
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,010
Hey!

122
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,710
Not good. This is not good.

123
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,250
See you tomorrow.

124
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,020
Hey, Takumi.

125
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,880
Let me ask you something.

126
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,720
Suppose--just suppose--a racer
were to challenge you to a race.

127
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,030
You'd accept, of course, right?

128
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,500
No way. I'm not into that scene.

129
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,570
What?! Don't say that!

130
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,230
What's it matter to you?

131
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,340
Um... well... uh... That's beside the point.

132
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,210
You know, if a racer receives a challenge,

133
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,880
he has to stand up and accept it!

134
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,010
Well, that may be true for a racer.

135
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,950
But I'm no racer.

136
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,350
No racer?

137
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:14,880
Besides, being forced to accept
challenges just isn't my thing.

138
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:21,830
<i>Not good. This is definitely not good...</i>

139
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,960
What'll I do?

140
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,420
<i>Only two more days to go.</i>

141
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,650
<i>Eight-Six, Ryosuke Takahashi,</i>
<i>your days are numbered.</i>

142
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,990
<i>I'll show you who's number one!</i>

143
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,370
Iketani!

144
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,170
You accepted a challenge from
the Night Kids of Mt. Myogi?!

145
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,540
Why were you keeping something
that big a secret from us?!

146
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,180
I don't know what you're talking about.

147
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,980
It's no use trying to deny it.

148
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,550
The word's out all over town.

149
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,790
Eight-Six and R32 going at it on the downhill!

150
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,190
Eight-Six? That's news to me!

151
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:26,190
What?! The word is, Nakazato came
to this gas station in person

152
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,860
to issue the challenge!

153
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,530
Takumi. Have you heard anything about this?

154
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,330
No, not a word.

155
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,870
No one knows about this? What's going on?

156
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,340
S-Sorry!

157
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,480
Itsuki... you didn't...

158
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,470
I... I accepted the challenge!

159
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,520
Please forgive me!

160
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,660
Yesterday, Nakazato of the
Night Kids really came here.

161
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,500
He came by when Iketani
and Takumi were out. I...

162
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,330
I couldn't help but pretend to be
a member of the Speed Stars...

163
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,730
...and before I knew what was happening...

164
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,600
...he had already issued
the challenge and driven off.

165
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,510
Why didn't you tell us about this before?!

166
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:18,110
I was going to tell you, I swear.
I was just waiting for the right moment.

167
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,550
Takumi, I'm sorry. I messed up.

168
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,350
Please forgive me!

169
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,550
It's a bit late now...

170
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:31,290
Forgive me... Please forgive me...

171
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,030
Looks like the R32's out again tonight.

172
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,700
He's racing against the
Eight-Six tomorrow night, right?

173
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,370
I'm definitely going to watch that!

174
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,110
If Nakazato of the Night Kids
is challenging the Eight-Six

175
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,450
that beat Keisuke Takahashi,

176
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,080
there's no way we can miss that!

177
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,050
On the surface it may seem like a race

178
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,450
between the Speed Stars and the Night Kids,

179
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,160
but it's really a battle
between Nakazato's pride

180
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,860
and the pride of the Red Suns'
Takahashi Brothers!

181
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,930
No matter how the race turns out,

182
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,760
Ryosuke Takahashi's not going
to just sit back and watch.

183
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,930
The summer nights are
starting to heat up already!

184
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,600
Oh, man...

185
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,340
What are we going to do?

186
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,580
Everyone around town's
talking about this race.

187
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,850
It's too late to back out now.

188
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,380
Maybe I'd better ask Takumi to race.

189
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:35,420
Even Takumi might not have
what it takes to go against the R32.

190
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:41,300
That Night Kid Nakazato is as famous
a racer as the Takahashi Brothers...

191
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:46,770
It'd be a tough battle. It might
even be over from the get-go.

192
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:52,210
On second thought, maybe I
shouldn't ask him after all.

193
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,060
There you go.

194
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,730
Hey... Dad.

195
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,360
Is an R32 any good?

196
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,670
R32? Yeah... That's a fast car...

197
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,370
Could you win? In a downhill...

198
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,340
...against the R32?

199
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:32,610
Yeah. I'd win against any
car I raced, R32 or not.

200
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,250
Do you think... I can win?

201
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,290
I don't know...

202
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:43,190
It'd be a close race.

203
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,730
Why are you asking?

204
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,930
You gonna race an R32?

205
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:48,960
No...

206
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,770
I'm... I'm just asking...

207
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,360
See ya.

208
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,640
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

209
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,550
<i>Now it's against an R32...</i>

210
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:10,250
<i>I'd better adjust the Eight-Six's settings...</i>

211
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:21,020
<i>It'd be a close race.</i>

212
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,600
I thought I'd find you if I
came here around this time.

213
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,310
It was about this time the night I first met you.

214
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,810
So you're going against Nakazato
from the Night Kids, huh?

215
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,550
You're the talk of the town.

216
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,380
For your information, I don't
recall accepting that challenge.

217
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,220
What?!

218
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,650
He came to challenge me while I was away.

219
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,560
I don't intend to race him.

220
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,890
What do you mean you
don't intend to race him?

221
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,330
Night Kid Nakazato issued a
personal challenge to you, right?

222
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,530
Why don't you just accept it?

223
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:38,010
Show him who's the fastest! You can beat him!

224
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:42,410
Why does it matter to you?
This is between him and me.

225
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,380
No, it's not just between you two!

226
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,280
It's because you beat me!

227
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:53,620
If you lose to anyone, it's gotta
be to the Takahashi Brothers!

228
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,960
Until one of us beats you,
you can't lose to anyone else!

229
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,530
Not even to the R32!

230
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,530
I said I wasn't going to race him!
I have no reason to.

231
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:08,400
Reason? Does any racer need a reason to race?

232
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,410
Who ever said I was a racer?

233
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,510
I'm in no mood for jokes!
Are you being sarcastic?!

234
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,750
In order for your technique
to be as good as it is,

235
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,050
you must have practiced for years!

236
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:24,720
Why would someone drive
like a racer if he's not a racer?!

237
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,990
I don't drive like I do because I like it.

238
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,860
I have to in order to help out at home.

239
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,390
Stop denying it.

240
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,760
No one can get as good
as you if they hate driving.

241
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,500
That's not it... You wouldn't understand.

242
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,400
You're the one who doesn't understand!

243
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,370
Could someone who hates
racing ever master drifting?

244
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:50,380
Only a person who loves the sport
could master something like that!

245
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,380
Maybe you don't realize it, but you're a racer.

246
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,750
Deep down you love driving! You hear me?!

247
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,990
If you love driving, then that
makes you racer enough!

248
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:06,860
And if you're a racer, then you should
be proud of your driving skills!

249
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,570
Accepting challenges is a racer's pride!

250
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,130
You make me sick.

251
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,660
<i>Do I really like driving...</i>

252
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,590
<i>...but just don't realize it?</i>

253
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,560
<i>Still...</i>

254
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,270
<i>...being forced to accept every</i>
<i>challenge that comes along...</i>

255
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,570
<i>That isn't for me!</i>

256
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,380
Hey! Itsuki! Where's Takumi?

257
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,240
He's on the late shift today.

258
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,410
Oh...

259
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:01,280
Iketani...

260
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,950
I'm going to go to Mt. Akina
tonight to apologize to Nakazato.

261
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,560
Itsuki...

262
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,530
I'll get down on my knees if I
have to and tell him the truth.

263
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,130
Maybe he'll understand.

264
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,460
Besides, the Speed Stars had
nothing to do with this...

265
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,000
You don't think we can
convince Takumi to race?

266
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,370
No. I know him better than anyone,
and he'll never do it...

267
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:29,180
He hates being forced into things

268
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,050
or having to follow others' orders.

269
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,210
He looks real mellow,

270
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,580
but once he says something,
there's no changing his mind...

271
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:42,320
<i>Stubborn... just like his father.</i>

272
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,330
He doesn't understand why
racers have to accept challenges.

273
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,430
The whole system offends him.

274
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,900
When someone tries to force
him to do something, he snaps.

275
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,740
One time in eleventh grade, he flipped out

276
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,540
and beat up a group of
seniors after soccer practice.

277
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,200
What?! Takumi did that?

278
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:17,320
Boss, I finished cleaning up outside.

279
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,230
Thanks.

280
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,630
No problem. See you tomorrow, then.

281
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,160
Takumi!

282
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,470
Come and have a seat.

283
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,130
Okay...

284
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:33,240
You know, I overheard some talk.

285
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,580
You're going to race an R32 tonight?

286
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,180
What? I'm...

287
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,880
Don't do it, Takumi. That guy's bad news.

288
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,750
Uh... No, I wasn't...

289
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,890
No, no. I know what you're going to say.

290
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,860
I've known everything from the beginning.

291
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:54,060
I know it wasn't your decision to take this race.

292
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,200
Itsuki was the one who screwed
up and accepted it, right?

293
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,230
Yeah...

294
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,270
You know, you're too nice sometimes.

295
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,870
You gotta stop bailing your
friends out all the time.

296
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,210
Trust me. Whatever you do,
don't race that R32.

297
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,480
There's a lot you don't know about cars.

298
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,510
Do you even know what an R32 can do?

299
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,810
Is an R32 that amazing?

300
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,790
<i>Gotcha! He took the bait...</i>

301
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,160
It's beyond amazing.

302
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,330
That car's in a class by itself!

303
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,200
Its driving system combines everything good

304
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,030
about FR and four-wheel drive.

305
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,300
It's a beast!

306
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,070
An Eight-Six or GT-R is no match for it.

307
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,340
If the driver was an amateur,
you'd have a chance,

308
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,210
but you're up against a famous racer, right?

309
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,510
<i>Dad didn't tell me this.</i>

310
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:47,710
<i>He said it'd be a close race.</i>

311
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,150
Hey.

312
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,050
You with me?

313
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:55,820
You just became famous yourself
by beating that team from Akagi.

314
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,490
You shouldn't ruin your name so fast...

315
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,260
It's not wise to go up against someone
you have no chance of defeating.

316
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,000
You hear me?

317
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,200
Since your opponent's driving an R32,

318
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,570
no one would call you
a coward for backing out.

319
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,510
<i>A coward?!</i>

320
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,410
Boss...

321
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:21,450
Thanks for the warning...

322
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:27,220
...but I could care less
about my fame as a racer.

323
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,260
So you aren't going to back down?

324
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,030
No.

325
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,400
Hearing about how amazing that car is

326
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,530
has only made me want to see it in action.

327
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:49,400
I'm not afraid of an R32 or any other car.

328
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,820
Whew!

329
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,880
He's exactly like his father...

330
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,720
"Temporarily Closed

331
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,720
Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

332
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,600
Temporarily closed?

333
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,730
Dad never said anything about this.

334
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,840
How's he going to make
money if the shop's closed?

335
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,170
Oh, no! The car!

336
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,580
If he went out drinking, I'm really in trouble.

337
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,880
He won't be back until morning!

338
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,420
I can't do anything without a car.

339
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,790
I should have asked to borrow it this morning!

340
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,860
Look at the crowd!

341
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,560
There's even more people out
tonight than at the Akagi race!

342
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,230
Why did so many people come tonight?

343
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,930
You know they're not here to see the R32.

344
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:50,940
Yeah, they want to see that Eight-Six drift!

345
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:56,980
They say he barrels through
corners as if they're straightaways!

346
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,110
I can't wait to see this!

347
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,180
Oh... I see...

348
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:08,490
Uh, if he happens to show up,
could you ask him to call home?

349
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,350
Thanks...

350
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,000
It's no use... I can't find him...

351
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,400
Damn!

352
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,360
Where the hell are you?!
Give me back my Eight-Six!

353
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,460
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

354
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,530
<i>So no one intervenes</i>

355
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,060
<i>Never stop, I don't want to stop</i>

356
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,130
<i>Even if you cry because of a sacrificed love</i>

357
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,930
<i>Aim for the peak, sweep the winding street</i>

358
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,140
<i>Beep beep! The warning chime is so cheap!</i>

359
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,600
<i>The sheep should clear the road</i>

360
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,040
<i>'Cuz I'm never gonna stop, streak my dream</i>

361
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,910
<i>Easy motivation is total stimulation</i>

362
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,980
<i>You tried to escape,</i>
<i>but anywhere is a safety zone</i>

363
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,990
<i>Something is within your grasp</i>
<i>and something is forgotten</i>

364
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,920
<i>Even if the world ends it will never change</i>

365
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:24,000
<i>Beasty shout, no one can touch you</i>

366
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,370
<i>Cross over now to the time of an intense dream</i>

367
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,410
<i>Rage your dream, split the darkness</i>

368
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,380
<i>Like a streak to the peak</i>

369
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:43,520
<i>Erase the freezing darkness worldwide</i>

370
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,390
<i>Rage your dream, and open the road</i>

371
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,060
<i>Di-ding down, another round never slow down</i>

372
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,060
<i>A point 01 second knockdown</i>

373
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,260
<i>Reverberations left behind,</i>
<i>disappear to the next town</i>

374
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,100
<i>The losers are left in the dust</i>

375
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,060
<i>Let's ignore the constraints of logic</i>

376
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,030
<i>'Cause they're a pain</i>

377
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,170
<i>A streaker runs naked across the street</i>

378
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,370
<i>Something they would know</i>

379
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,410
<i>Rage your dream,</i>
<i>continue on the unending road</i>

380
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,410
<i>Don't look back on your love or your past</i>

381
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:15,480
<i>Go forward and you'll shine brightly</i>

382
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,550
<i>Rage your dream, you're living in the now</i>

383
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,500
<i>Kenji, who do you think will win</i>

384
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,170
<i>this battle Itsuki got us into,</i>
<i>the R32 or the Eight-Six?</i>

385
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,400
<i>Of course, I'd like to say the Eight-Six...</i>

386
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,270
<i>...but I don't know if even Takumi</i>
<i>can beat a GT-R, the fastest domestic.</i>

387
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,270
<i>The biggest question is if</i>
<i>Takumi will even come to race!</i>

388
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,240
<i>If he doesn't show up,</i>
<i>then Kenji will once more...</i>

389
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,850
<i>Don't say it!</i>

390
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,380
<i>Next time on Initial D, "Time's Almost Up!"</i>

391
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,450
<i>Takumi, please get here soon!</i>

392
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,350
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
