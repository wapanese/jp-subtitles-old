Even the 1991 model costs 1.3 million yen.

34
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,930
The S13 is expensive.

35
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,670
Like I thought, it's gotta be the Eight-Six.

36
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,400
The Eight-Six is a real possibility.

37
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,040
Anyway, the car has to be FR. Right, Takumi?

38
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,110
Takumi!

39
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,350
Hey! Are you listening?

40
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,250
I'm listening, Itsuki.

41
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,580
So how much is this Eight-Six?

42
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,690
Well, this one is 300,000 yen...

43
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,350
...but it hasn't passed inspection.

44
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,590
How much have you saved so far?

45
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,690
About 50,000 yen.

46
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,460
You've got a long way to go.

47
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,900
Yeah... Yeah...

48
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,900
Isn't there any way to make
a lot of quick money?!

49
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,470
With our current part-time
jobs at the gas station,

50
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,040
even if we work full-time
during summer break,

51
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
we'll only make 120,000 yen at most.

52
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,180
There's gotta be a better job out there.

53
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,210
You guys are working part-time?

54
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,870
Mogi...?

55
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,720
What? Is it so strange that I'm talking to you?

56
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,490
Not really...

57
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,990
You said you could get 120,000
working full-time this summer.

58
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,430
How many hours are you
supposed to work every day?

59
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,370
From early in the morning till late at night.

60
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,770
What?!

61
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,440
You can only make 120,000
a month for that much work?!

62
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,170
That's about right...

63
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,410
Wages for high school students are really low!

64
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,280
I didn't know...

65
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,540
I've never had a part-time job...

66
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,020
Good luck with your job!

67
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,790
Let's get together after finals!

68
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,630
Sure!

69
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,530
She just said, "Let's get together!" didn't she?

70
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,000
--Yeah.
--Go out with Mogi?!

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,400
Good! Good!

72
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,470
Takumi, why didn't you tell me?

73
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:14,480
--You should have told me you're Mogi's friend.
--I haven't talked with her in about a year.

74
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,010
We were in the same club.

75
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,980
We talked a lot until last summer.

76
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,690
What are you talking about?
Who cares about that?

77
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,190
Natsuki Mogi...! What a great turn of events!

78
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,650
I've been checking her out
for a while... She's so cute...

79
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,270
Takumi! Hey, Takumi! Quit zoning out!

80
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,000
If we don't hurry, we'll be in big trouble!

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,670
We've got a grammar test next class!

82
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,230
Wait up!

83
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,550
Hey, why don't we buy an Eight-Six together?!

84
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,180
If we combine our money,
we can afford the loan.

85
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,350
No way.

86
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,190
Why do you want a car that badly?

87
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,590
Your family already has a car, right?

88
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,990
It's no good.

89
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,690
My old man's car is an automatic
and front-wheel drive.

90
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,500
And it's a diesel. It's crap.

91
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,830
I wouldn't even call it a car...

92
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,900
It has four tires and it runs. It's a car.

93
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,870
You just don't get it.

94
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,810
If it's not fun on the mountain pass,
you can't call it a car.

95
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,910
What do you do on the mountain?

96
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,680
What do you think?! We're going
to challenge the corners!

97
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,490
Challenge the corners...?

98
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,920
Is that fun?

99
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,890
Of course it's fun!

100
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:39,860
You're a guy and you don't
want to tackle the corners?!

101
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,160
I'm already tired of that kind of stuff.

102
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,400
What? What do you mean?

103
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,530
We just got our licenses last month.

104
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,720
You look cute.

105
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,020
That outfit always looks great on you.

106
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,520
Really? Thank you, Papa.

107
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,900
You know, Papa, one of my
classmates is working part-time.

108
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,870
He says even if he works all summer,

109
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,710
he'll only earn 120,000 yen.

110
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,380
Well, that's about right.

111
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,980
It's hard earning money, isn't it?

112
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:41,990
You spend more than that on me in a month.

113
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,830
Is it really all right to spend so much on me?

114
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:49,500
Of course. You're worth it.

115
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,270
Really?

116
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,390
I don't understand...

117
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,540
--Thank you very much!
--Thank you very much!

118
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,680
Hey, Takumi! Please think
about the Eight-Six deal.

119
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,520
I don't care about an Eight-Six!

120
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,790
You kids have good taste...

121
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,550
...trying to get an Eight-Six.

122
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,720
See? See? Iketani thinks so too, right?!

123
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,190
Yeah, the Eight-Six is a good car.

124
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,860
I told you.

125
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,230
But I...

126
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:26,200
To be honest, I don't know
what an Eight-Six is.

127
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,240
Who makes it?

128
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,140
Are you serious, Takumi?

129
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,970
Want to drink some high octane?

130
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,640
Working at a gas station and
you don't know the Eight-Six?!

131
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
What a disgrace!

132
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,480
Oh, well. It's no surprise.

133
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:44,020
When the Nine-Two model came out,
you guys were just in 2nd or 3rd grade.

134
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,590
We have an old car at my house,
but we just use it for our deliveries.

135
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,320
You can't compare that to an Eight-Six!

136
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,730
Even if it's old, the Eight-Six is special!

137
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,000
When we buy an Eight-Six,
will you let us join your team?

138
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,230
I've always dreamed of joining
the Akina Speed Stars.

139
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,000
Sure! Oh, by the way...

140
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,440
It's Saturday, so everyone is
meeting at Mt. Akina tonight.

141
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,040
You guys wanna come along?

142
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,680
What?! Can we?

143
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,110
But we don't have a car...

144
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,010
I'll give you a ride.

145
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,290
We can ride in your S13?!

146
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,460
I'll go! I'll go! I'm definitely going!

147
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,890
You're going too. Right, Takumi?
This is a rare opportunity!

148
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:29,130
--Um, I never said I wanted to go.
--Cool! I can meet the whole team!

149
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,140
Excuse us. We're going home!

150
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,170
All right! I'll pick you up
at the bus stop at 8 PM.

151
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,730
Okay!

152
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,740
You're really into it.
Which mountain are you going to?

153
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,350
Boss, Mt. Akina is the only mountain
around here worth racing on.

154
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:52,320
We're the fastest team on Mt. Akina.

155
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,990
Many claim that they're
the fastest on Mt. Akina.

156
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,830
When I was still racing,

157
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,530
there was a guy that everyone
admitted was the fastest.

158
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,330
And he's still driving on Mt. Akina.

159
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,000
Still?!

160
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,940
I know all the racers at Akina...

161
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,840
...but none of them are that old.

162
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,240
It's just because he drives during
a different time. Because...

163
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,750
...he's now the owner of a tofu shop.

164
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,850
What?

165
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,850
About 4 o'clock in the morning,

166
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,350
he delivers his tofu to the hotels at Lake Akina.

167
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:30,290
It's amazing to watch his downhill speed.

168
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,430
Because it's his business,

169
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,790
he makes the run every day,
even in the rain and snow.

170
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:39,600
He knows even the smallest stain
on the asphalt on Mt. Akina.

171
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,900
I'd even bet on it.

172
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,570
The fastest downhill car on Mt. Akina...

173
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,310
...is the Eight-Six from the tofu shop.

174
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,470
The Eight-Six from the tofu shop?!

175
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,740
"Green Shopping Street"

176
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,280
Going out, Takumi?

177
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,950
Yeah. I have plans with Itsuki.

178
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,490
I don't care if you're out at night,

179
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,360
but I'll drag you out of bed if you
don't wake up in the morning.

180
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,030
You don't need to remind me.

181
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,050
I'm going.

182
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,350
Shut up, Takumi!

183
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,680
You're ruining Iketani's concentration.

184
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,550
Whatever! But this sucks, and I'm scared!

185
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,620
No big deal. Everyone gets scared
when they ride with a street racer.

186
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,350
Next, we'll take the hairpin in second gear!

187
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,560
You're still too noisy, Takumi!

188
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,770
All right. Tonight, I'm going all out.

189
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,450
Are you all right, Takumi?

190
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,550
I didn't think you'd get that scared...

191
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,490
I was in the mood and
pushed the car quite a bit.

192
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,990
You're a wimp, Takumi! Shame on you!

193
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,490
You're the type who screams
on roller coasters, aren't you?!

194
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:16,330
I've never thought that
roller coasters are scary.

195
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,730
It's not like that...

196
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,200
Itsuki, even if I explained it to you,
you'd never understand...

197
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,170
...this fear...

198
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,830
What?

199
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,520
<i>I've never seen them before...</i>

200
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,190
<i>They're headed for Mt. Akina</i>
<i>at this time of the night?</i>

201
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,600
<i>Something may happen</i>
<i>on the mountain tonight.</i>

202
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,200
We've got visitors.

203
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,560
<i>The Red Suns?</i>

204
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,920
<i>Are they the Red Suns,</i>
<i>the fastest drivers in Akagi?</i>

205
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:46,350
We're the members of
the Akagi Red Suns Team.

206
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,620
I don't want to be rude, but...

207
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,860
Who's the fastest team, or driver,
on this mountain? Please tell us.

208
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,130
--What do they want?
--We're the fastest.

209
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,900
We're the Akina Speed Stars Team.

210
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,200
We consider ourselves the fastest here.

211
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,410
Then we've found what we're looking for!

212
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,370
Would you like to hold a practice session

213
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,210
with our team, the Akagi Red Suns,
here at Mt. Akina?

214
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:14,650
--What?
--Are they serious?

215
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:18,750
Wow! What a great turn of events!

216
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,250
What do you think?

217
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,860
Since we usually only run with people
we know, it's becoming routine.

218
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,490
Running against other teams
gives us a new challenge.

219
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,160
We can make new friends
and exchange knowledge.

220
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,530
And it improves our skills, too.

221
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,500
At first, we can run together.

222
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,240
Then each team will be
represented by one driver

223
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,070
to compete in both uphill and downhill.

224
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,010
We aren't concerned about winning or losing.

225
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,880
We only seek to develop
friendship between the teams.

226
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,550
What do you think?

227
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,580
--If you put it that way, how can we refuse?
--Okay.

228
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,050
How about next Saturday at 10 o'clock?

229
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,750
Okay, fine.

230
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,590
Today, we'll just take it easy.

231
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,620
Awesome! This is awesome, Takumi!

232
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,870
We don't need to be intimidated!

233
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,570
--We're going, too!
--Yeah!

234
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,720
Iketani!

235
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,520
Let me watch the Takahashi Brothers--

236
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,660
people call them the fastest in Akagi!

237
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,330
You mean the Takahashi Brothers,

238
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,900
the famous street racers who've
been featured in the magazines?

239
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,700
Yes. They're also known
as "The Rotary Brothers."

240
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,010
Iketani! What about us?!

241
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:49,210
Sorry. When I make a serious run,
I don't take passengers.

242
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:52,010
Wait here. I'll pick you up later.

243
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,860
This sucks! Why're we the
only ones without a car?

244
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,160
Hey, Itsuki...

245
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,400
Is it that much fun to be a street racer?

246
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,300
I don't get it...

247
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,810
Why does everyone get so excited about it?

248
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,040
I'm the one who doesn't get it!

249
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,510
We can hear the sound of cars

250
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,240
running hard one after another, right?

251
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,520
Why can't you get excited about it, Takumi?!

252
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,420
Excited?

253
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,990
Hello, Fujiwara Tofu Shop...

254
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,190
Oh, it's just you.

255
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,760
What a surprise...

256
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,830
Just me?

257
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,100
I haven't talked to you in so long,
and this is the greeting I get?

258
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,500
The other day, you passed me on
your way back from a delivery.

259
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,110
I signaled, but you ignored me.

260
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,840
Nope, it wasn't me.

261
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,010
It had to be you. It was your Eight-Six.

262
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,120
Well, I mean...

263
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,020
...it was my car, but I wasn't driving it.

264
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,550
My son Takumi delivers tofu to the hotels now.

265
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,290
What did you say?!

266
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,130
Since when?!

267
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,860
Five years ago.

268
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,360
Five years ago? Since he
was in the seventh grade?

269
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,520
Damn! I can't keep up with them at all!

270
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,030
<i>They're fast! I'm at my limit,</i>

271
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,730
<i>but I can't keep up with any of the Red Suns.</i>

272
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,670
What do you think, brother?

273
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,210
They're all trash.

274
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:05,010
Even our second string can easily beat them.

275
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,380
We don't need to bring
the top drivers next week.

276
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,880
I'll pass.

277
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,690
If you're not gonna come, I guess I'll pass, too.

278
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,490
No, you should run.

279
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,660
You should set a record for this course

280
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,990
which the locals can never break.

281
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,030
Otherwise, the name of the Akagi Red Suns

282
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,800
will never become legendary.

283
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,560
Yeah...

284
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,800
First, we'll set new records for
every course in this prefecture.

285
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,140
Then we'll take Saitama,
Kanagawa, Tokyo, and Chiba.

286
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,910
We'll have every record
in the entire Kanto region,

287
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:38,180
then we'll become legends,
and then we'll retire.

288
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:43,240
That is the Akagi Red Suns'
"Fastest in Kanto Project."

289
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,600
They're incredible.

290
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,440
They are completely different from us.

291
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,610
I'm totally shocked that we got
so beaten on our home ground.

292
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:10,110
They've put serious money into their
suspensions, and they've got power, too.

293
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,550
There's no way we can
compete with the Red Suns.

294
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,380
But how can we avoid a
challenge on our own turf?

295
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,150
That's right! We can't back out now!

296
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:21,290
But guts alone won't beat those guys.

297
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,790
I know that... But...!

298
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,490
It's getting late.

299
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,490
Let's get together tomorrow and talk about it.

300
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,870
Street racers don't like losing.

301
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,740
They get too serious about racing.

302
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:43,140
There's nothing worse than losing to
outsiders on your own home ground.

303
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,210
It's like a law for street racers.

304
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,330
Where's Ryosuke?

305
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,060
He went home a while ago.

306
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,500
We're the only ones still here.

307
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,730
It's almost dawn.

308
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,530
I guess we should head back, too.

309
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,120
If I get serious, they can't keep up with me.

310
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,420
They're still at that level...

311
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,680
Finally caught up, huh?

312
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,930
That's not one of ours.

313
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,300
Is that an MR2 or a 180?

314
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,380
Nice driving. But after two corners,

315
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,750
I won't even see you in my mirror.

316
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,000
An Eight-Six?!

317
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,770
You've gotta be kidding!

318
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,690
My FD can't outrun an old Eight-Six?!

319
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:43,060
Is this some sort of nightmare?! Crap!

320
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,190
I'm the No. 2 driver of the Akagi Red Suns!

321
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,410
<i>Doesn't he know this road?</i>

322
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:56,040
<i>After this slow right, there's a sharp left.</i>

323
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,770
<i>If he doesn't slow down, he'll be in the ravine!</i>

324
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,580
I knew it! He's going too fast!

325
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,650
There's no more room to slow down!

326
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,090
What the hell?!

327
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,920
Inertia drift?!

328
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,460
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

329
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,530
<i>So no one intervenes</i>

330
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,060
<i>Never stop, I don't want to stop</i>

331
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,130
<i>Even if you cry because of a sacrificed love</i>

332
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,930
<i>Aim for the peak, sweep the winding street</i>

333
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,140
<i>Beep beep! The warning chime is so cheap!</i>

334
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,600
<i>The sheep should clear the road</i>

335
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,040
<i>'Cuz I'm never gonna stop, streak my dream</i>

336
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,910
<i>Easy motivation is total stimulation</i>

337
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,980
<i>You tried to escape,</i>
<i>but anywhere is a safety zone</i>

338
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,990
<i>Something is within your grasp</i>
<i>and something is forgotten</i>

339
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,920
<i>Even if the world ends it will never change</i>

340
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:24,000
<i>Beasty shout, no one can touch you</i>

341
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,370
<i>Cross over now to the time of an intense dream</i>

342
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,410
<i>Rage your dream, split the darkness</i>

343
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,380
<i>Like a streak to the peak</i>

344
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:43,520
