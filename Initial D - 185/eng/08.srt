Look at that crowd!

32
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,540
More people here than at the FD run.

33
00:01:53,540 --> 00:02:00,050
The race between Takumi and
Nakazato is getting a lot of attention.

34
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:04,420
What am I gonna do? I'm getting
more depressed by the minute.

35
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,330
We are in no position to say it was a mistake.

36
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,530
Takumi!

37
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,190
Please show up!

38
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:25,070
"Act 8: Time's Almost Up!"

39
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,950
<i>Damn it! My stupid old man!</i>

40
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,520
<i>Where the hell are you?!</i>

41
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,420
Could you win if it were you?

42
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:44,120
Yeah. I'd win against any
car I raced, R32 or not.

43
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,730
Do you think... I can win?

44
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:54,040
I know it wasn't your decision to take this race.

45
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,140
Trust me. Whatever you do,
don't race that R32.

46
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,240
You hear me?

47
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,010
Since your opponent's driving an R32,

48
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,180
no one would call you
a coward for backing out.

49
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,870
<i>A coward?!</i>

50
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,490
--Wow!
--Here they come.

51
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,860
--The Night Kids!
--It's Nakazato's R32!

52
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,740
It's amazing!

53
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,610
The black R32 is like a champion of the street.

54
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,520
So these are the Night Kids.

55
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,010
They sure came in with a big group!

56
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,760
K... Kenji!

57
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,260
We'd better start apologizing soon.

58
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,730
Well... but...

59
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,870
There's still time before 10:00.

60
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,240
Let's go talk him into it.

61
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,500
--What?
--What?

62
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,210
I don't think it's such a good idea

63
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:09,010
to drag Takumi into a losing battle.

64
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,250
We'll never know until they actually race.

65
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,350
Of course he'll lose.

66
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,880
It's obvious if you're thinking clearly!

67
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,690
He's going to race the R32!

68
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,190
He can't match its power,
and it's got 4WD ATTESA E-TS!

69
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,000
I thought the same at first.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,200
But since I've been here, I've started
thinking there may be a chance.

71
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,340
Of course, if this was the circuit,
the Eight-Six couldn't win.

72
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,840
But this is a mountain pass!

73
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,840
This is the pass Takumi has been
running for the last five years.

74
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,180
Nobody knows what's going to happen.

75
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,110
When Takumi drives the Eight-Six,

76
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,380
it's no longer an ordinary Eight-Six.

77
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,050
It turns into a super machine
with infinite fighting power!

78
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,130
I know, because I have been
in the car when he's driving...

79
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,630
Takumi's driving is far better
than anything we've ever imagined.

80
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,130
You mean that time when you fainted
after three corners down the hill

81
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,400
with your death wails
echoing through Mt. Akina.

82
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,510
His downhill driving is that crazy!

83
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,310
There should be one other
person who feels the same way.

84
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,020
Wh... Who is that?

85
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,490
There is one other person who
got a good look at his driving.

86
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,220
Are... Are you trying to say...?

87
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,880
That's right!

88
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,430
Keisuke Takahashi of the Red Suns!

89
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,900
Here come the Takahashi Brothers!

90
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,000
--Now we have more stars!
--It's so exciting!

91
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,240
Keisuke!

92
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,940
My dear Ryosuke!

93
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,410
You look great!

94
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,750
They have groupies now 'cause they're cool.

95
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,840
Damn it! Racers should be
admired for their skills.

96
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,190
--I'm no match for them either way.
--I'm no match for them either way.

97
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,290
On top of that, they're rich.

98
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,400
I knew they would be here!

99
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,690
I'm looking forward to seeing

100
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,330
how this race turns out.

101
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,760
Watch closely!

102
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,930
I'll show you who the fastest man in Gunma is!

103
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,430
Not the Eight-Six or the Takahashi Brothers...

104
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,770
It's me! Takeshi Nakazato of the Night Kids!

105
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,170
Bastard!

106
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:57,180
Looks like the Eight-Six isn't here yet.

107
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,450
In that case,

108
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,180
we have to persuade Takumi no matter what.

109
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,880
All right...

110
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,320
Get in!

111
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,120
Itsuki! What's wrong?

112
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,460
I'll... stay, Iketani...

113
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,500
I can't face Takumi...

114
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,170
Okay.

115
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,470
Wait here until the last possible minute, Itsuki!

116
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,810
I'll bring him, no matter what!

117
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,150
<i>I'm sure that Takumi is coming.</i>

118
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,980
<i>But still...</i>

119
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,390
--Ryosuke! Dear Keisuke!
<i>--What a nice place I'm in!</i>

120
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,020
I might make a habit of this!

121
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,500
Ryosuke! Wait!

122
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,700
Ryosuke, honey!

123
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,450
<i>What's going on? I'm so tense I could die.</i>

124
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:09,450
<i>I wanna go to Mt. Akina so bad.</i>

125
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:14,950
<i>I'm not really sure if I love</i>
<i>driving that much, but...</i>

126
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:21,800
<i>For the past five years, come rain or snow,</i>

127
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,730
<i>I've driven Mt. Akina more often than anyone.</i>

128
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:30,840
<i>I want to see how much I'm capable of.</i>

129
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,640
<i>Everyone says that the GT-R is really fast,</i>

130
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,510
<i>so I want to challenge it</i>
<i>with everything I've got.</i>

131
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,150
<i>I've never felt like this before.</i>

132
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,050
<i>I can't stop thinking about racing,</i>
<i>even though I don't have a car.</i>

133
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,510
<i>On the contrary, I want to</i>
<i>race more every second.</i>

134
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,400
My stupid dad!

135
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,090
Where the hell did you go?

136
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,990
Oh!

137
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,140
Takumi!

138
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,300
Iketani!

139
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,150
What?!

140
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:20,350
Your father has taken the car?

141
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,560
Yeah...

142
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,530
You have no idea where he might be?

143
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:29,230
I thought he might be at some bar,

144
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,070
and I called every bar I know.

145
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,140
You couldn't find him?

146
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,740
Uh-uh...

147
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,470
What the hell...?!

148
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,740
If you don't have the Eight-Six,
there's no use talking about it.

149
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,310
This is really unexpected.

150
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,680
Iketani, did you come here
to talk me into racing?

151
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,190
Kind of, yeah.

152
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,590
People are making a big
deal over this at the pass!

153
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,520
Nakazato of the Night Kids

154
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,030
and the Takahashi Brothers
are stirring up the crowd.

155
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,500
But despite all that...
you are the star today, Takumi!

156
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,700
Wait a minute! Please...

157
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,370
...don't give me a hard time.

158
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,110
Still... you haven't changed your mind?

159
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,570
It's not that.

160
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,710
To tell you the truth, I wanted to go.

161
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,450
--What?!
--What?!

162
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:23,450
But without the car, what can I do?

163
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,520
I was very depressed until you arrived.

164
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,860
Gee! Why is this happening?

165
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,590
How disappointing!

166
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:34,030
What can we do without the car?

167
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,200
I've got an idea! Hey, Takumi.

168
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,870
How about running in Kenji's 180?

169
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,230
Great idea!

170
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,870
It's the same FR...

171
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,070
...and it's got turbo for extra power...

172
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,710
It sure will run fast if you drive it.

173
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:50,310
--It won't work.
--Why not?

174
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,050
I'm not gonna race in somebody else's car.

175
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,120
It's gotta be my own car that I'm used to.

176
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,490
You have a point.

177
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,990
Driving somebody else's car

178
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,260
is not a good thing in the racing world.

179
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,500
Anyway, I'll wait until the last minute.

180
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,930
That's my only option.

181
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,330
He's late. What's going on?

182
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,380
It's already 9:45.

183
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,400
I guess he's not coming.

184
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,920
Where is he?

185
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,550
--What time is it?
--Almost 10:00.

186
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,090
Oh, no! He's not gonna make it!

187
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,420
<i>Where are you, Dad?</i>

188
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,860
<i>Please come back!</i>

189
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,230
<i>I don't have any more time!</i>

190
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:55,280
--He's back!
--What?

191
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,240
Turning off of the highway...

192
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,740
...gunning the engine twice,
that rhythm... and that roar...

193
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,350
He's here.

194
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,000
You can tell that just from the exhaust sound?

195
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,400
Are you sure it's your car?

196
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Of course I am. It's absolutely my car!

197
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,780
The Takahashi Brothers are here.

198
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,950
Yeah...

199
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,380
They must be very anxious about this race.

200
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:41,050
They told me to my face that I'd lose.

201
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,560
Damn Ryosuke Takahashi!

202
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,360
He's not as good as his reputation suggests.

203
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,230
I'll beat the Eight-Six right in front of him

204
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,430
and embarrass him.

205
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,140
Let's do it.

206
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,910
And if you show that you're
faster than the Eight-Six

207
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,580
that beat Keisuke Takahashi...

208
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,850
...we can prove that we're
faster than the Red Suns.

209
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:11,820
This is a good opportunity to
make the crowd realize something.

210
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,690
The drift run can never beat the grip run.

211
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:21,000
There you go! It's like your favorite phrase.

212
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,530
It's a matter of course.

213
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,730
The drift run is just a
performance to rile up the crowd.

214
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,540
It's not a technique for driving fast.

215
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,210
It's just like you to say it firmly.

216
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,510
I can say this, 'cause I went
through a drift stage myself

217
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,550
when I was driving the S13.

218
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,950
A racer who has outgrown the
drift run can drive the fastest

219
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,420
in the grip run.

220
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,850
When you lost to the R32,

221
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,860
it was really shocking.

222
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,030
Oops! That was a no-no.

223
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,230
Well... I've changed since then.

224
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,360
Since that monster defeated me,

225
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,300
I'm driving better than ever before in the R32.

226
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,910
You can't call yourself a street
racer if you stop pursuing races.

227
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:10,210
I can't stand everyone making such
a fuss about the drift technique.

228
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,880
Come out, Eight-Six!

229
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,050
Showing off by drifting in your FR is over.

230
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,550
I'll prove it!

231
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,220
As usual, he doesn't show up
until the last minute.

232
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,190
I wonder if he'll really show up.

233
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,000
Didn't he tell you he had
no intention of coming?

234
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,100
He's coming.

235
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,340
I'm sure of it.

236
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,700
He'll definitely come.

237
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,280
Anyway, that's the story.

238
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,620
So I'm taking the car, Dad!

239
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,680
You'd better hurry, Takumi!

240
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,950
It's almost time.

241
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,720
We're sorry... We're taking Takumi with us.

242
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,690
We'll buy ten of your deep-fried
tofu in return when we get back.

243
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,020
Th-The ones mixed with veggies, too...

244
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,060
Hey! Wait!

245
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,970
<i>Takumi...</i>

246
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,340
<i>His eyes looked different.</i>

247
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,640
<i>What's going on?</i>

248
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,350
<i>Never mind.</i>

249
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,980
<i>With that setting, he'll do a good job.</i>

250
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,990
We're almost at the pass.

251
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,890
I wonder if you can catch up.

252
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,000
Sorry to disappoint you,

253
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,170
but his car is a non-turbo 1.6.

254
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,830
This is a 2-liter turbo.

255
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:43,170
Whatever the case may be going downhill,

256
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,440
it's no joke if I fall far behind him going uphill.

257
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,740
Who do you think I am?! One of
the top three in the Speed Stars.

258
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,160
Wow!

259
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,120
So fast!

260
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,220
I can do that, too.

261
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,470
To full power!

262
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,540
--Oh...!
--Oh...!

263
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,700
He's gone!

264
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,470
The Eight-Six has disappeared!

265
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,420
<i>Takumi... You were looking away</i>
<i>even during the entrance ceremony.</i>

266
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,400
Two minutes to 10:00.

267
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,160
<i>I guess they couldn't talk him into it.</i>

268
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,550
<i>I should go apologize like a real man.</i>

269
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,890
<i>Wait! Iketani told me to wait.</i>

270
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,860
<i>I should do as I was told.</i>

271
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,630
<i>But this is all my fault.</i>

272
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,340
<i>Nothing to do with the Speed Stars.</i>

273
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,670
<i>I should take my punishment like a man.</i>

274
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,580
<i>Oh, no! There are so many of them!</i>

275
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,580
<i>Looks like I have to roll with the punches.</i>

276
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,990
<i>This is no joke!</i>

277
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,230
<i>I doubt they'll be willing to forgive me</i>

278
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,390
<i>if I tell them the Eight-Six isn't coming now.</i>

279
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,380
<i>Apologizing on my knees won't help.</i>

280
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:07,150
<i>If worse comes to worst, I might get killed.</i>

281
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,120
<i>Dad! Mom!</i>

282
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,520
<i>Help me!</i>

283
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,550
<i>Please, God!</i>

284
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,960
<i>I haven't even done it with a girl yet.</i>

285
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,960
<i>I don't wanna die a virgin.</i>

286
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,560
--It's him!
--He's here!

287
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,330
<i>Oh, no! They found me!</i>

288
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,130
It's too late to run.

289
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,360
<i>I'm dead!</i>

290
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,090
What the hell are you doing

291
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,820
sitting in the middle of the road, Itsuki?

292
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,590
Ta... Ta... Ta...

293
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,060
Get out of my way!

294
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,360
Come on! I'm gonna run you over.

295
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,030
Takumi!

296
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,270
You came!

297
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,640
Yeah...

298
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,770
Sorry, Itsuki... for being late.

299
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,780
Takumi...!

300
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,610
A street racer should race
if he's challenged, right?

301
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,550
Takumi...!

302
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,310
Don't... Your snot... Hey, stop, Itsuki!

303
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,960
Yeah... That's the spirit!

304
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,130
Hello, this is Fujiwara Tofu.

305
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,300
Oh, Yuichi!

306
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,340
Are you there?

307
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,210
I wonder what happened to my son.

308
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,340
He wanted to go to the pass of his own accord.

309
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,080
Like father, like son, huh?

310
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,380
Putting that aside,
today his opponent is a GT-R.

311
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,090
Honestly, does he have a chance?

312
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,390
He really did show up.

313
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,660
Keisuke, you were right.

314
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,930
So it seems...

315
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,000
You were gonna tell that Eight-Six's driver

316
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,170
about the R32's weak point, weren't you?

317
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:09,040
I was, but not anymore.

318
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,540
Once I saw his face, I felt nothing but disgust.

319
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:17,200
He's my enemy, after all. Besides...

320
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:23,010
...he won't lose, even if he doesn't
know the R32's weak point.

321
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,120
Did you give him any advice?

322
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:32,360
Nothing special, but even
the GT-R has a weak point.

323
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,360
The R32's weak point is...

324
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,260
Put simply... the body weight...

325
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,800
...the understeer resulting
from being super front-heavy.

326
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,640
Even with a tuned pedal
and driving technique,

327
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,710
this basic fact doesn't change.

328
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,710
If you keep driving tough on the downhill,

329
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,710
the front tires and brakes
will wear out for sure.

330
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,750
Even with a tuned brake,

331
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,050
by the time they come
to the bottom of the hill,

332
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:00,920
it'll have trouble with the
understeer going into the turn.

333
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,590
If there is any chance of winning,

334
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,990
it's in the corners towards
the end of the course.

335
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,430
Whether or not the Eight-Six can
keep up with the R32 until then...

336
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,840
That's the key to this race.

337
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,040
About the Eight-Six's foot settings...

338
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,910
I changed the settings a little bit.

339
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,930
The foot settings? How?

340
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,350
So that it will heavily understeer
when you step on the gas pedal.

341
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,520
That's how the foot setting is now.

342
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,590
What?! Understeer by
punching the accelerator?!

343
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,690
Takumi's driving uses drift.

344
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,690
What were you thinking, Bunta?

345
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,130
How can he race with that
foot setting against the GT-R?

346
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,600
You don't understand, Yuichi.

347
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,970
If you are good enough,

348
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,470
the understeer setting allows you
to accelerate faster when it's FR.

349
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,400
For the purpose of carrying tofu,
