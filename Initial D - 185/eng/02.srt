Hey, Takumi! Takumi!

47
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,370
How late are you going to sleep?
Wake up and get the phone.

48
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,770
It's Itsuki, isn't it?

49
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,740

Takumi! Over here!

53
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,900
--Did I surprise you?
--Yes.

54
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,770
I answered the phone thinking it was Itsuki.

55
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,680
I've been wondering if it's all right

56
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,010
that maybe you and I could be friends again.

57
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,010
I didn't know we weren't...

58
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,610
We never had a fight, right?

59
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,360
You guys were talking about
cars at school yesterday, right?

60
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,760
Can you drive, Takumi?

61
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,690
Yeah. I just got my license.

62
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,730
Okay, then let's go for a drive
during summer vacation.

63
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,370
You do the driving,

64
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,700
and I'll make lunch for us.

65
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,170
That's all right, but...

66
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,910
...the car is used for business,
so it is pretty sad-looking.

67
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,310
I don't care about that.

68
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,480
It has a stereo, doesn't it?

69
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,050
I don't care what kind of car it is.

70
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,320
I don't mind at all.

71
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,850
Really?

72
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,850
It will definitely be fun.

73
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,820
I'm excited about it.

77
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,270

"Kitamura"

80
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,250
No doubt about it. It's an Eight-Six.

81
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,760
I'd even bet on it.

82
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,360
The fastest downhill car on Mt. Akina...

83
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,590
...is the Eight-Six from the tofu shop.

<i>be faster than the latest machines.</i>

90
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,150
What am I thinking,

91
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,850
searching all over for this car?

92
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,150

93
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,980

94
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,990

95
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,090
What are you doing around here?

96
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,060
What? Is this your house?

97
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,990
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

98
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,650
Yes.

99
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,070
What were you doing in front of my house?

100
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,570
Um, well...

101
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,370
I had some things to do,
and I just happened to pass by.

102
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,410
More importantly, Takumi...

103
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,540
You really don't know
anything about cars, do you?

104
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,100
Huh?

105
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,220
Yesterday, you said you didn't
know what an Eight-Six was, but...

106
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,420
...the car at your house is an Eight-Six.

107
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,320
What? Hold on a minute.

108
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,860
That's not an Eight-Six.

109
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,960
I'm pretty sure it says "Trueno" on the back.

110
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,860
Right. A Trueno is an Eight-Six.

111
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,630
The AE86 chassis Levin and Trueno

112
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,400
are also known as the "Eight-Six."

113
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,000
What?

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,910
What?! An Eight-Six at Takumi's house?!

115
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,340
Are you serious, Iketani?

116
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,350
Yes, I'm serious.

117
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,980
Takumi, you jerk!

118
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,050
Why did you keep it a secret?!

119
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,220
What could I do? I didn't even know.

120
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,520
If it's a Trueno, just say it's a Trueno.

121
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,530
You said it's an "Eight-Six,"
but normal people don't call it that.

122
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,590
Why, you...!

123
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,430
By the way, let's have a little talk.

124
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,100
Next Saturday, maybe you could
borrow the Eight-Six for a bit?

125
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,540
--Why?
--Isn't it obvious?

126
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:57,110
To go watch the Speed Stars
and Red Suns meet, of course!

127
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,080
Since yesterday's incident,

128
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,680
I'm really into the street racing scene!

129
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,020
Don't you want to see Akagi's
fastest drivers, the Takahashi Brothers?

130
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,660
Not really.

131
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,690
What?!

132
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:15,360
How can you say that?
Even to your own friend?!

133
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,900
I beg you...

134
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,540
Give me a ride in the
Eight-Six on Saturday, please?

135
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,040
Hey, you guys.

136
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,040
What are you standing around for?
A customer is waiting.

137
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,010
Yes, yes! I'm sorry!

138
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,910
Welcome!

139
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,020
You're putting on brand-new tires?

140
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,390
You must have spent a lot.

141
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:46,760
It's only the tires, but I need
high grip to reduce my times.

142
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,030
I'm also replacing the brake pads.

143
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,730
On the downhill, braking is crucial.

144
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,370
Will you run, Iketani?

145
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,570
Yes. I'll run the downhill.

146
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,910
I'll attack Akina's downhill
as if I've got a death wish.

147
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,510
Don't overdo it.

148
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,350
One mistake on the downhill can be fatal.

149
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,650
I understand.

150
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,220
I understand, but I have to
overdo it just a little bit...

151
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,710
...for the pride of our hometown.

152
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,010
<i>That Eight-Six...</i>

153
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,910
<i>It hasn't appeared today, either.</i>

154
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,380
<i>Maybe the driver wasn't a local?</i>

155
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,490
<i>No, that's impossible. He was totally</i>
<i>familiar with this mountain.</i>

156
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,760
<i>I want to face him again.</i>
<i>If I don't get my revenge,</i>

157
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,760
<i>then I won't calm down!</i>

158
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,230
<i>Show yourself...</i>

159
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,660
<i>...Ghost of Akina.</i>

160
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,760
<i>I don't give a damn about the Speed Stars.</i>

161
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,200
<i>I came here to face you.</i>

162
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,510
Wow! The one and only Drift King,
Keiichi Tsuchiya! I can't believe it!

163
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,440
It looks like he can control it
just by using the gas pedal.

164
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:11,980
Takumi...

165
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:16,620
Don't you wish we could go out
right now and drift just like this?

166
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,220
--Sure.
--Check out this drift! Awesome!

167
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,560
Sure.

168
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,530
Takumi...

169
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,960
Sure.

170
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,870
Hey! You keep saying, "Sure. Sure."
Do you even know what drift is?

171
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,530
Sure, I know what drift is.

172
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:37,570
Well, then, can you tell us what it is?

173
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,240
In a curve...

174
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,680
Don't say "curve." It's not cool.

175
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,050
Street racers say "corner."

176
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,720
Okay, in a corner...

177
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,150
...you make the front tires slide

178
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,550
so that the car won't face the inside.

179
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,420
What?!

180
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,560
That's a good one, Takumi!

181
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,600
If the front tires are sliding,
that's called "understeer,"

182
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,430
which is totally uncool
and for people with no skill.

183
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,740
A true drift isn't in the front--

184
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,600
it's in the rear.

185
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,510
You're really funny.

186
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,340
--That was great, Takumi!
--It definitely was!

187
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,250
<i>Iketani, you're the one</i>
<i>who doesn't understand.</i>

188
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,110
<i>While in the middle of a drift,</i>

189
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,680
<i>the car is basically understeering.</i>

190
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,720
<i>That was the highly advanced answer of those</i>

191
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,890
<i>who have mastered the four-wheel drift.</i>

192
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,760
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

193
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,130
Customers are here! Get to work.

194
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,260
Yes, sir!

195
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,720
--Welcome!
--Welcome!

196
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,740
<i>An FD...</i>

197
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,800
<i>Could it be Keisuke Takahashi?</i>

198
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,280
High octane, fill it up.

199
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,810
Yes, sir.

200
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,360
You're a real enthusiast.

201
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,700
I see. I thought I had seen
that S13 somewhere before...

202
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,570
The Speed Stars.

203
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,350
Can I ask you one thing?

204
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,050
You'd be the one who'd know...

205
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,580
Is there a ghost on Mt. Akina?

206
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,110
The ghost of a super fast Eight-Six.

207
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,530
Wow. Is he planning to fly with this?

208
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,930
Please don't joke around with me, sir.

209
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,440
The part about the ghost was a joke,

210
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,800
but it's a black-and-white panda Trueno.

211
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,770
On the outside, it's a normal Eight-Six...

212
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,540
...but inside, it's an incredible monster.

213
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,240
There's no way a local like
you doesn't know about it.

214
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,550
Well, fine then.

215
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,920
If that's your secret weapon
for this Saturday's meet,

216
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,020
then I just got my wish.

217
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,820
Tell the driver of that Eight-Six

218
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,890
that I won't lose to the same guy twice.

219
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,360
The reason I lost last time

220
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,530
is because I didn't know
the course and I got careless.

221
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,730
Thanks for coming.

222
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,570
<i>Keisuke Takahashi lost?</i>

223
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,910
<i>What did he mean?</i>

224
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:30,110
<i>I don't know anything about such an Eight-Six.</i>

225
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,880
<i>Could it be...?</i>

226
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,590
<i>The Eight-Six I saw at Takumi's house</i>

227
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,590
<i>was a panda Trueno.</i>

228
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,620
<i>Was the boss telling the truth?</i>

229
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,460
<i>The fastest on the downhill</i>
<i>is still that Eight-Six?</i>

230
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,230
"Green Shopping Street"

231
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,830
All right, that's it for today.

232
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,610
Isn't this a lot more than usual?

233
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,080
It's fine. Just don't spill any.

234
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,110
I know.

235
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,740
Your face is sleepy as usual, Takumi.

236
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,510
Sorry, but I was born with this face.

237
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:43,740
Don't forget the Eight-Six on Saturday.

238
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,380
I know. You're so persistent, Itsuki.

239
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,580
If I don't make sure about it,
you might back out on me.

240
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,350
Please, Saturday, come quickly!

241
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,360
I'm totally excited!

242
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,690
Hey, if both of us aim to become street racers,

243
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,130
maybe someday we'll be
known as the fastest on Akina.

244
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,170
I don't really care either way.

245
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,300
Well, even if you tried,
it'd be hopeless for you.

246
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,310
After seeing you scream in
the back seat of Iketani's car,

247
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,910
it's obvious you don't have an ounce of talent.

248
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,640
But I'm different!

249
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,750
I was a little bit scared,

250
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,220
but I was able to look at the
corner exit with my teeth clenched.

251
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,480
Even Iketani has faith in me!

252
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,250
He must think Takumi is hopeless,
but I have a bright future!

253
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,430
Huh? Takumi?

254
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,930
Takumi!

255
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:36,660
Takumi! Takumi, wait a second!

256
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,500
What's wrong with you? I know
you're jealous of my talent,

257
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,270
but aren't you being a bit cold?

258
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,500
I'm not...

259
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,040
And then Rumiko told my boyfriend
all about it. He got really mad!

260
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,280
I saw.

261
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,380
You like that kind of stuff?

262
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,680
Of course not!

263
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,850
It must be a crime to let them
make their skirts that short.

264
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,510
The school should make a new rule...

265
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,160
Lucky!

266
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,660
Good morning, Takumi!

267
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,030
Mogi?!

268
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,740
That's right. I have to talk
to you about something.

269
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,640
Come along, quickly!

270
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,200
What is this?! What the hell is going on here?!

271
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,980
What's wrong?

272
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,220
Well... I...

273
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,560
There's something I want to tell you.

274
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,550
What is it?

275
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,160
Well...

276
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,060
I...

277
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,330
I bought a new bathing suit!

278
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,570
It's totally cute.

279
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,770
Is that what you wanted to tell me?

280
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,340
Bingo.

281
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:56,510
I was so happy that I just had
to tell somebody about it!

282
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,210
Wanna see it? Are you
wondering what color it is?

283
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,980
You want to see it soon, right?

284
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,480
Well, I want to, but...

285
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,390
I'll let you see as much as you like

286
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,220
when we go to the ocean, okay?

287
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,990
Until then, just... you... wait... and... see.

288
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,890
How about this Sunday? Are you free?

289
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:16,630
Yes. I have a break from work.

290
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,900
Okay, it's decided. It's a promise.

291
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,370
A promise should never be broken.

292
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,470
There are only two kinds of people that I hate.

293
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,960
People who break their promises
and people who smoke.

294
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,060
<i>Damn. It's too tough.</i>

295
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,330
<i>The corners that I never thought of as corners</i>

296
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,000
<i>are becoming more and more dreadful.</i>

297
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,170
<i>These corners that I am so familiar with</i>

298
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,940
<i>have now begun to show their fangs!</i>

299
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,570
<i>It's no use. Even if I push myself to the limit,</i>

300
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,870
<i>I can't cut my times down.</i>

301
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:32,310
<i>I thought that if I gave it more throttle,</i>
<i>I could cut my times down.</i>

302
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,370
<i>But it's not that simple.</i>

303
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:38,180
<i>Is this the limit of my technique?</i>

304
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:42,380
<i>There's no way I can compete with them.</i>

305
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,060
Hello! Excuse me!

306
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,920
Hello?!

307
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,500
Excuse me!

308
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,570
I can hear you. Give me a minute.

309
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,190
Sure.

310
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,540
Welcome.

311
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,370
<i>Is this the Eight-Six driver</i>
<i>and the fastest on Akina?</i>

312
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:10,170
<i>Is this the guy who defeated</i>
<i>Keisuke Takahashi's FD?</i>

313
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,380
What do you want?

314
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,940
Sir?

315
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,990
Fried tofu, please.

316
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,520
Coming right up.

317
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,390
<i>What am I doing?!</i>

318
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,220
Um... I...

319
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,990
My name is Iketani,

320
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,520
and I'm with a street racing team
called the Akina Speed Stars.

321
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,870
The truth is, I heard this strange rumor

322
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,210
that the fastest downhill driver on Mt. Akina

323
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,980
is an Eight-Six driven by
the owner of a tofu shop.

324
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,380
I don't know who told you that, but it's not me.

325
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,250
Please don't play dumb!

326
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,990
I searched the whole city, and this is
the only tofu shop with an Eight-Six!

327
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,180
Here you go. 140 yen.

328
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,360
Thank you.

329
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,000
Well... I'm kind of in a tough situation.

330
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,030
Can you please listen to what I have to say?

331
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,040
What a bother. Right in
the middle of my work...

332
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,440
But you're not doing anything!
I'm the only customer here!

333
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,210
That was rude, saying something like that...

334
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,680
I'm sorry, but I'm desperate.

335
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,380
The truth is, a team called the Akagi Red Suns

336
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,390
challenged us to a time attack battle.

337
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:30,120
The Red Suns have some drivers
with awesome technique.

338
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,430
Nobody on our team can compete with them.

339
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:38,030
But since this is our mountain,
we definitely don't want to lose!

340
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,800
So what do you want me to do?

341
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,870
Mr. Fujiwara... Please teach me
how to tackle Mt. Akina.

342
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,880
That's an impossible request.

343
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,480
Please! Even just enough to make
me a tenth of a second faster!

344
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,120
I beg you!

345
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,750
I know how you feel,

346
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,320
but driving technique cannot be
improved in two or three days.

347
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,730
In order to make your car do what you want,

348
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:10,030
you have to think continuously
and practice on your own.

349
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,170
When I was actively racing,

350
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,240
I was tackling Akina even in my dreams.

351
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,770
Technique isn't something that can be taught.

352
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,170
It's something you find on your own.

353
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:30,350
Sorry... I can't help you.

354
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,120
Mr. Fujiwara, I'll be back again.

355
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:54,370
<i>"Think continuously and</i>
<i>practice on your own..."</i>

356
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,580
<i>I've done that, but my times</i>
<i>haven't improved a bit.</i>

357
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,140
<i>Why not?!</i>

358
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,010
<i>Dammit! No matter how hard I try,</i>
<i>I just can't understand it!</i>

359
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,850
<i>I can't avoid it! Please! Get to the inside!</i>

360
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,460
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

361
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,530
<i>Sou tanin wa kaizai shinai</i>

362
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,060
<i>Never stop, tomaritakunai</i>

363
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,130
<i>Gisei ni natta ai ga cry shite mo</i>

364
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,930
<i>Peak mezashite, sweep the winding street</i>

365
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,140
<i>Beep beep! Keikokuon wa so cheap!</i>

366
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,600
<i>Sheep-tachi wa michi wo akero</i>

367
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,040
<i>'Cuz I'm never gonna stop, streak my dream</i>

368
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,910
<i>Easy na motivation subete wa simulation</i>

369
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,980
<i>Nigetemitatte doko demo safety zone</i>

370
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,990
<i>Nani ka wo te ni irete nani ka wo wasureteku</i>

371
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,920
<i>Sekai ga kowaretemo kawaranai</i>

372
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:24,000
<i>Beasty shout, dare no te ni sae oenai</i>

373
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,370
<i>Hageshii yume jikan sae mo ima koeteku</i>

374
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,410
<i>Rage your dream, yami o harisaite iku</i>

375
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,380
<i>Like a streak to the peak</i>

376
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:43,520
<i>Sekaijuu no kogekitta yoru o keshiteku</i>

377
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,390
<i>Rage your dream, michi o hiraiteku</i>

378
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,060
<i>Di-ding down, another round never slow down</i>

379
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,060
<i>Konma zero-ichibyou de knockdown</i>

380
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,260
<i>Yoin nokoshikietekou to the next town</i>

381
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,100
<i>Hokori mau haishachi ni hau</i>

382
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,060
<i>Rikutsu dake no nougakitachi</i>

383
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,030
<i>Jamakusai kara shikato shitekou</i>

384
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,170
<i>Streaker satte yuku street no mukou</i>

385
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,370
<i>Something they would know</i>

386
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,410
<i>Rage your dream, tsuzuku hatenai michi wo</i>

387

00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:30,530
<i>Okay, today's guest is the stubborn</i>
<i>owner of the Fujiwara Tofu Shop,</i>

391
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:33,100
<i>Mr. Bunta Fujiwara.</i>

392
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,200
<i>Mr. Bunta, according to your theory,</i>

393
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,400
<i>driving technique cannot be taught.</i>

394
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,040
<i>You must find it on your own, right?</i>

395
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,040
<i>--That was really cool. I was impressed.</i>
<i>--Thanks...</i>

396
