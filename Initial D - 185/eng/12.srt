Don't insult me!

38
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,190
What incredible speed!

39
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,100
Brake lights?!

40
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,760
Braking while cornering at that speed?!

41
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,940
<i>Darn, I can't keep up.</i>

42
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,240

<i>That EG6 may be faster</i>
<i>than Takumi's Eight-Six...</i>

44
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,890
Who's driving it?

45
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,740
Thank you very much!

46
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,350
I was really furious!

47
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,720
So, he was braking while
cornering... at high speed?

48
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,560
I don't think I've ever seen anything like it.

49
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,160
Really?

50
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,270
Everybody does that!

51
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,600
I step on the brake while
cornering all the time.

52
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,940
Uh-oh, I'm going too fast...

53
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,180
I'm scared... step, step...

54
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,880
We're not talking about a beginner...

55
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:52,390
This EG6 cleared those downhill
turns at an incredible speed.

56
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,620
EG6?

57
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,690
It's a Honda Civic!

58
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,700
Why don't they just call it a Civic, then?

59
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,960
The Civic is very popular among street racers,

60
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,400
even though it's an FF.

61
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,800
It's a non-turbo 1.6 liter like your Eight-Six,

62
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,980
but its VTEC engine has tons of power.

63
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,810
It has been a rival of the Levin
and the Trueno for years.

64
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,690
As an Eight-Six driver,
you should know about the Civic.

65
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,990
As a Levin driver myself...

66
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,980
...I can't let a Civic pass me!

67
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,400
Anyway, I just can't believe
it went in at that speed

68
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,930
and then braked.

69
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,770
Well, that technique is called left foot braking.

70
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,370
Left foot braking?

71
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,240
You usually don't use
this technique with an FR,

72
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,850
but you brake with the left foot

73
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,420
to stabilize the car at
an extremely high speed.

74
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,890
With an FF like an EG6,

75
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,590
you need your right foot on
the gas pedal continuously

76
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,020
to avoid understeering,

77
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,690
so you brake with your left foot

78
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,500
to take the weight off the rear
tires and turn more sharply.

79
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,400
He must be a highly experienced
FF driver to use that technique.

80
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,670
I'm sure he's fast.

81
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:21,810
He was pretty fast... That punk...

82
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,880
I only avoided crashing
because I'd just practiced

83
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,820
spinning with the emergency brake.

84
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,220
Otherwise, my S13 would've
been in the shop again!

85
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,750
I'm gonna make that EG6 pay!

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,660
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

87
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,100
I'm home...

88
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,540
Hey, someone called for you earlier.

89
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,570
--Who was it?
--I didn't ask.

90
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,210
A girl... A pretty girl.

91
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,010
She said she would call back.

92
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,950
How could you tell she was
pretty over the phone?

93
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,790
I've developed good intuition over the years.

94
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,820
Cars and women... it's all about
experience and intuition.

95
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,950
--Good luck with both of them.
--Yeah, yeah...

96
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,330
Well, I'm off to a meeting...

97
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,720
Uh... Fujiwara Tofu Shop...

98
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,890
--Hello, Takumi?
--Oh... Mogi...

99
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,660
Were you sleeping?

100
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,250
Remember the other day you were saying...?

101
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,450
This better be real, Takumi!

102
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:08,970
If this turns out to be a joke... you'll be sorry!

103
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,320
Are you sure she's bringing her friend?

104
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,820
Don't worry...

105
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,360
Mogi said she was bringing her friend.

106
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,160
I wonder if she's cute... or has a nice body...

107
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,170
...or maybe she is beautiful!

108
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,870
I think she is Mogi's junior high school friend.

109
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,910
As long as she is decent-looking...

110
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:37,810
I shouldn't expect too much...

111
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:42,020
I can't believe you kept your promise, Takumi!

112
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,350
I'm so lucky to have a good friend like you...

113
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,890
It's nothing, really...

114
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:52,160
I'll be the best racer at Mount Akina
with a pretty girl in my arms.

115
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:01,000
Not on my Levin, you darn pigeons!

116
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,640
They should be here by now...

117
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,200
Hey!

118
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,440
Were you waiting long?

119
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,980
--Don't do that, Mogi!
--Hi.

120
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:15,380
Itsuki, this is my friend Saori.
Saori, this is Takumi and Itsuki.

121
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,150
Nice meeting you.

122
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,780
You, too.

123
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,480
She's... very pretty...

124
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,670
So you are a street racer?

125
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,740
Well, I belong to a team
called the Akina Speed Stars,

126
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,840
and I'm the third or fourth fastest...

127
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,320
I'm well known in Gunma
as "Levin of Mount Akina."

128
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,550
Pretty cool!

129
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,650
What's a street racer?

130
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,890
What, you really don't know?

131
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,520
A street racer is a...

132
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,190
<i>Oh, man! She's far beyond my expectations!</i>

133
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,250
Watch out, Itsuki!

134
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,710
--Want me to drive?
--No, I got it.

135
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:16,270
Sorry, a street racer's bad habit...

136
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,130
Feeling okay?

137
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,620
I'm fine...

138
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,430
He drives kind of rough...

139
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,730
Hey! Takumi and Natsuki!

140
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,470
Look at us!

141
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,940
Why don't you join us?

142
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,810
They do look good together.

143
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,440
Yeah...

144
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:27,380
Need a ride home?

145
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,850
Thank you, but Saori and I
have a lot to catch up on.

146
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:36,190
I had a good time, Itsuki.
Maybe we'll do it again.

147
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,260
--See ya.
--Yeah.

148
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,130
Uh, Saori...

149
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,730
See ya, Saori!!

150
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,800
Yeah!

151
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:04,690
Not bad... she's not bad at all...

152
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,850
Saori.

153
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,490
I feel life energy surging through me...

154
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,660
Saori!

155
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,400
Watch the road, will you?

156
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,260
Don't worry!

157
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,730
I don't know how to thank you, Takumi.

158
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,040
Yippee!

159
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,370
"Maybe we'll do it again," she said...

160
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,270
Maybe just the two of us next time...

161
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,330
--Hey, light!
--Wha...?

162
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,860
Sorry... I'm sorry...

163
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,230
Thank you very much!

164
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,770
Well, what should I do next?

165
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,580
Work, work, work...

166
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,650
He's in a good mood. Did he meet a girl?

167
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:10,580
--Maybe...
--He can't have a girlfriend before I do!

168
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:17,360
By the way, Takumi,
would you like to drive my S13?

169
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,260
It's refreshing to drive
different cars sometimes.

170
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,930
No, thank you.

171
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:27,270
I'll pass. I mean... you love that car...

172
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,770
Please, Takumi?

173
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,440
I can learn so much from watching you drive it.

174
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,070
Please?

175
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:52,020
Are you serious about racing
against the Eight-Six of Mount Akina?

176
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,250
You'll see.

177
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,130
All right, let's go.

178
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,150
<i>Come on out, Eight-Six of Mount Akina.</i>

179
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,710
<i>I can hardly wait...</i>

180
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,530
Do I really have to?

181
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,990
Please, Takumi.

182
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,200
Just drive normally...

183
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,500
It'll still be educational for me.

184
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,730
I'll owe you big!

185
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:37,400
I'm not really good with
other people's cars, so...

186
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,670
I don't think I'll be any help...

187
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,440
He's begging this much, so just this once?

188
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,350
Yeah, Takumi. Just this once.

189
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,350
Okay, just this once, then.

190
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,350
Please don't expect too much.

191
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,220
You will?

192
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,710
Yeah!

193
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,560
All right, Iketani. Just don't faint again...

194
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,130
Don't worry, this is my second time around...

195
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,970
Bring it on, Takumi!

196
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,730
--Here we go, then.
--Yeah!

197
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,520
What should I do first?

198
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,590
Well, how about showing me a braking drift?

199
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,390
Okay.

200
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,730
Wha... hey...

201
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,390
Are you doing it at the first turn?

202
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:43,430
Aren't we going in a little too fast...?

203
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,470
I hope Iketani's all right.

204
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,140
It's...

205
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:35,760
"Iketani Passes Out!"

206
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,080
"Wow! I... I saw it!

207
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,850
The agonized cry of his last
moment echoed through Mt. Akina!

208
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,050
The scary downhill!

209
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,150
Iketani, in the third corner...

210
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,920
...passed out!"

211
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,690
...all over again, perhaps.

212
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:57,610
<i>He can drift effortlessly in a</i>
<i>car he's never driven before...</i>

213
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:02,120
<i>I never knew my S13 could go this fast!</i>

214
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,960
It's different from my Eight-Six,
but I think I'm getting the hang of it.

215
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,390
But we only went through three turns...

216
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,690
I'm ready for a drift.

217
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:17,320
<i>A drift? Then what was he doing before?</i>

218
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:52,170
I think I got it right on that last turn.

219
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,760
<i>It's too advanced for me to understand...</i>

220
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,320
They're back!

221
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,300
Oh, man. You made it this time.

222
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,040
You've conquered it!

223
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:34,310
So, did you get a good look
at his braking drift, Iketani?

224
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,840
Not really... no idea...

225
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,250
So much for begging him to show you how.

226
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:48,160
Yeah, but he made it look
so simple that I realized...

227
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,060
...I'm not even close to
understanding his technique!

228
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,530
I feel like a better racer already!

229
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,090
Wha...?

230
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,710
That's the EG6 from yesterday!

231
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,380
That punk!

232
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,650
Hey, you!

233
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,660
I know you're the one who
hit me from behind yesterday.

234
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,330
Who are you?

235
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:03,230
Don't tell me you forgot this S13!

236
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,000
Oh, you...

237
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,070
That's right! You owe me an apology.

238
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,840
I could've gotten badly hurt.

239
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,010
Are you kidding me? That was your fault.

240
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,040
What?

241
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,850
Your car was going so slow
that I couldn't anticipate it.

242
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,280
I never thought you could
attack a corner that slowly.

243
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,720
I tried to brake, but... bump.

244
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,390
What did you say?!

245
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,690
Calm down, Iketani!

246
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,630
What a jerk!

247
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:36,030
Stepping all over Iketani's pride...

248
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:39,970
If you insist, then we'll race under my rules.

249
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,070
If I lose, I'll be on the ground
begging for your forgiveness.

250
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,470
What do you mean, "your" rules?

251
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,480
It's nothing.

252
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,450
We call it the "duct tape death match."

253
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,880
Duct tape death match?

254
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,150
Duct tape the right hand
to the steering wheel...

255
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,720
...and then race. That's all.

256
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,660
Duct tape the right hand
to the steering wheel?

257
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,500
Your shifting hand stays free...

258
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,760
<i>My right hand and the steering wheel...</i>

259
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:18,710
You can't switch hands...

260
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,070
You can't steer!

261
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,180
Too dangerous...

262
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,680
For you, definitely.

263
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:34,550
I hear the Speed Stars' Eight-Six
is a downhill specialist.

264
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:38,390
Maybe this kid can help you out?

265
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,870
Tell this Eight-Six kid

266
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:55,480
that I'll be waiting here
next Saturday at 10 p.m.

267
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,810
We'll have a duct tape death match...

268
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,680
I'll see you then.

269
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,460
