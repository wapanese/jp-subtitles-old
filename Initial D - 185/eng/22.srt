There must be some way to
make Takumi stop daydreaming.

24
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,650
The race is on the 15th,

25
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,020
so we still have one more week.

26
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,020
It's a good thing it's not tomorrow.

27
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,360
Aren't the Red Suns and the
Night Kids racing tomorrow?

28
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,830
That's it!

29
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,000
Take Takumi there and
make him watch their race!

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,170
It could be exciting enough

31
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,030
to snap him out of his daydreaming!

32
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,070
That's a good idea. That should do the trick!

33
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:28,170
He'll have a rude awakening.

34
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,850
"Act 22: Fierce Uphill Battle!"

35
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,000
Hey, Dad, I've been thinking...

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,870
About what?

37
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,510
I raced at Usui Pass the other night.

38
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,770
I thought it would be totally
different from Akina Pass.

39
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,420
But as I drove it...

40
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,790
...I realized that it felt very similar to Akina.

41
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,420
Very good.

42
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,860
Is it?

43
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,730
Usui is a completely
different course from Akina,

44
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,700
but you ran your usual race on it.

45
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,140
It's about how much "Akina"
you take with you to other courses.

46
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,100
--Good luck with the deliveries.
--Okay.

47
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,260
<i>How much "Akina"I take with me...</i>

48
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,480
<i>I think I sort of understand</i>
<i>what he's trying to say.</i>

49
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,490
I need a nap.

50
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,370
He's completely lost in a daydream.

51
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,640
Okay, let the operation begin!

52
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,380
Hey, Takumi!

53
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,050
Big news! Don't freak out!

54
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,650
The Red Suns and the Night Kids
are battling it out tonight!

55
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,820
--So?
--What do you mean, "so"?!

56
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,990
Since you're taking on
Ryosuke Takahashi next week,

57
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,360
this race is a must-see!

58
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,200
Okay, then!

59
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,540
Let's take your Eight-Six, since it's a
waste of gas to drive two cars there.

60
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,010
--Mine?
--I'm getting fired up!

61
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,180
You're excited too, right?

62
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,380
Right...

63
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,210
I'll meet you at your place at 7:00.

64
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,980
Don't forget to borrow the Eight-Six!

65
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,670
The crowd is huge.

66
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,840
Are Takumi and Itsuki here?

67
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,570
Not yet.

68
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,180
I sure hope Itsuki was able to pull this off.

69
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,020
Hurry up, Takumi, or we'll miss the race.

70
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,350
We got lost because you didn't
want to take the toll road.

71
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,520
You're too cheap.

72
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,860
Look who's talking.

73
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,360
You're the one who didn't drive to save on gas.

74
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,460
I've never heard of a racer
with no sense of direction...

75
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,140
<i>This must be a side effect of his daydreaming.</i>

76
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,230
I got it.

77
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,770
We really gotta hurry!

78
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,820
You made me wait.

79
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,960
The main character shows up last.

80
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,630
Myogi's ravine is steep, so try not to die.

81
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,800
Enough. Your hands are shaking.

82
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,610
Don't worry, it'll be quick.
No Night Kid can touch me.

83
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,100
Your arrogance could end your life.

84
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,450
Let's go, before the rain starts.

85
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,490
--Yeah.
--An Eight-Six!

86
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,750
Akina's Eight-Six came!

87
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,920
<i>An Eight-Six?</i>

88
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,700
Check out this huge crowd!

89
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,710
Just concentrate on finding them, okay?

90
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,610
I know...

91
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,780
...but it's hard to spot them in this crowd.

92
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,510
Where should we park?

93
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,520
What about the top?

94
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,350
There's a big parking lot.

95
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,290
All right, let's go up, then.

96
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,530
<i>I knew you'd come.</i>

97
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,570
<i>You're getting me fired up.</i>

98
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:56,400
<i>Eight-Six, I'll show you</i>
<i>how much I've improved.</i>

99
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,010
--An Eight-Six!
--You mean Akina's?

100
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,410
--Yeah.
--Is it really?

101
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,020
Hey Takumi, is it just me,

102
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,490
or do you think people are looking at us?

103
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,220
--Yeah.
--What do you mean, "yeah"?!

104
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,260
They totally recognize us.

105
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,830
Akina's Eight-Six is famous now.

106
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,500
They have their eye on you, you know?

107
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,600
It was a good idea to drive the Eight-Six here.

108
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,870
What are you muttering about?

109
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,580
Okay, come forward!

110
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,540
Forward!

111
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,860
Okay. The road is clear!

112
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,190
I'll count down!

113
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,260
Five... Four...

114
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,430
Three... Two...

115
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,560
One... Go!

116
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,580
Wow! What a fast start!

117
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,310
<i>I know Keisuke will win.</i>

118
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:16,050
<i>Don't lose. It's not an option on our turf.</i>

119
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,920
"Takahashi"

120
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,660
It's started.

121
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,390
<i>Rain...</i>

122
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,500
<i>The FD's best weapon is</i>
<i>its high cornering speed.</i>

123
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,270
<i>Don't forget that, Keisuke.</i>

124
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,680
Takumi?

125
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,510
Don't you think Myogi Pass
is similar to Akina Pass?

126
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,850
I don't know.

127
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,320
It seems more like Usui Pass to me.

128
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,190
It's nothing like Usui!

129
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:58,850
<i>It's no use. He's totally lost,</i>
<i>out in the deepest sea.</i>

130
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,500
Take a good look at it!

131
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,300
It's not as narrow as Usui,

132
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,840
and this uphill is just like Akina's.

133
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,470
I mean the rhythm is similar.

134
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,810
Rhythm...?

135
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,340
<i>Be careful! An FD is quick around corners.</i>

136
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:51,340
<i>I never thought anyone could</i>
<i>follow me up Myogi's hill.</i>

137
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,220
<i>He's starting to abuse the steering.</i>

138
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,690
<i>He's trying to speed away.</i>

139
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:05,320
<i>If he did that on a downhill,</i>
<i>the tires would compress.</i>

140
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,810
They just passed the mid-point.

141
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,280
The R32 is in front...

142
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,880
...but it's very close.

143
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,390
I see.

144
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,150
Tell me one thing...

145
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:10,160
How did Keisuke look coming out of the turn?

146
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,830
He was one step slower than Nakazato,

147
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:18,100
but overall, he seems under
control and very smooth,

148
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,970
unlike Nakazato's aggressive
but inconsistent run.

149
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,000
I got it. Thanks.

150
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:32,450
<i>You've improved, Keisuke,</i>
<i>to be able to race like that.</i>

151
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:36,450
The R32 is in front. Very tight!

152
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:41,290
They just passed me.
Nakazato is barely in front.

153
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,130
It sounds like Takeshi is doing well.

154
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,990
He's been training hard.

155
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,530
He became a different person
after losing to the Eight-Six.

156
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:57,840
<i>I've always considered Takeshi</i>
<i>to be my enemy. But now...</i>

157
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:03,940
<i>Knowing that he's fighting for</i>
<i>our pride, I feel the camaraderie.</i>

158
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,470
<i>I've never felt this way before.</i>

159
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,790
The R32's in the lead!

160
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,480
Win, Takeshi! I'm counting on you!

161
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,400
I can hear the squeals, but I can't see them.

162
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,400
What?

163
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,060
Rain...

164
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,980
Oh, no! They're battling at full speed!

165
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,750
It's most dangerous
when it first starts raining.

166
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,420
The rain lifts up the dirt and oil on
the surface and makes it slippery.

167
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,650
They could easily crash.

168
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,270
<i>Raindrops...</i>

169
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,170
<i>Darn, couldn't it have waited?</i>

170
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,370
<i>I gotta be alert.</i>

171
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,700
<i>I could lose control without warning.</i>

172
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,370
It's really coming down.

173
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:43,370
I hope they don't stop the race.

174
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,050
--Hey, Itsuki?
--Yeah?

175
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:51,250
Since that's the finish line,
this must be the last corner, right?

176
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,320
Yeah.

177
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,820
That's the highest point in Myogi Pass,

178
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,160
so this is a downhill corner.

179
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,320
The only downhill corner.

180
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,500
Here they come!

181
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,160
<i>This is it!</i>

182
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,690
<i>That's suicidal! You'll crash</i>
<i>into the wall at that speed!</i>

183
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,140
<i>I know I can do this!</i>

184
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,130
<i>My FD's telling me I can!</i>

185
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,680
They're coming at us!

186
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,000
The FD won!

187
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,250
I'm so impressed!

188
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,550
Man, Keisuke Takahashi is good!

189
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:37,390
<i>This is the first time that I</i>
<i>was inspired by other racers.</i>

190
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:42,560
<i>Seeing a great race like</i>
<i>that makes me restless.</i>

191
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,270
You got lucky, Keisuke Takahashi.

192
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,410
No, it was skill.

193
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,870
What?

194
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,040
The last corner was downhill,

195
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,350
so I knew it would come
down to the front tires.

196
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,520
You couldn't quite control them

197
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,890
because they were too compressed.

198
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,630
I kept up my speed,
but maintained the tire pressure.

199
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,920
It was skill.

200
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,980
You did it, Keisuke!

201
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,750
Should we do a downhill race?

202
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,590
We can't keep going in this rain.

203
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,890
--Right.
--Then, Keisuke...

204
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,330
--...please let me race the Eight-Six.
--What?

205
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:49,660
This isn't Akagi or his home course,

206
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,400
so this is as fair as it gets.

207
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,970
--Hey.
--Iketani.

208
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,800
Who is he?

209
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,330
--No idea.
--Kenta!

210
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,800
Takumi Fujiwara, isn't it?

211
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,350
Kenta Nakamura of the Red Suns.

212
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,750
How about me and you in this rain?

213
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,350
We gotta talk to my brother first.

214
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:15,190
Let's ask the spectators, Keisuke.

215
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,030
Wanna see us battle it out in the rain?!

216
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,660
--Yeah!
--Come on!

217
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,000
--Darn.
--Hard to say no now.

218
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,640
But he's racing against
Ryosuke Takahashi next week.

219
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,170
I'm first.

220
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:39,850
If you can't beat me, you're
certainly not worth Ryosuke's time.

221
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:42,020
What do you say?

222
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,690
I love racing in the rain.

223
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,720
Don't tell me you're scared of the rain?

224
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,360
No, not now!

225
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,700
He hasn't, uh, been himself lately.

226
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,700
Sure, why not?

227
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,460
Wow!

228
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,740
--Hold it.
--No one can stop it now.

229
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,710
--But...
--He's not anyone's "private" target.

230
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:16,380
Every racer wants a piece of him.

231
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,550
I know you understand that feeling.

232
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,390
That's more like it.

233
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:26,990
Downhill in the rain.
That makes it a pure skill race.

234
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:30,690
Set your proud Eight-Six next to mine.

235
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,430
--Let's go, Itsuki.
--I'm going, too?

236
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:39,440
If I leave you here, I'll have
to come back up afterwards.

237
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,170
Let's just race down and go straight home.

238
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,350
So, I'm getting in, then?

239
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,190
Wait, Itsuki, do you mind sitting in the back?

240
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,420
In the back? Okay, I guess.

241
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,890
Is this a strategy?

242
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:02,730
Maybe it is... maybe it isn't.

243
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,230
What? You don't know yourself?

244
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,100
How do I stay seated when you drift?

245
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,410
--You'll manage.
--What?! Hey!

246
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:16,710
It's only from here to the
bottom of the mountain.

247
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,380
It's not over. There's one more race.

248
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,610
I hear Akina's Eight-Six is racing!

249
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,590
No oncoming traffic!

250
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,320
Let's do this!

251
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,390
I wasn't expecting this.

252
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,160
Yeah. But there's nothing we can do now.

253
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,660
Don't worry, Keisuke.

254
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,970
I like rain.

255
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,100
Before I joined the team,
I purposely waited for rainy days

256
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,110
to practice my drifting technique.

257
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,750
The rain reduces the wear on the tires.

258
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,450
I see you're confident,
but don't take it lightly.

259
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,990
I'm the most experienced in the rain.

260
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,690
I know I'm better than him in the rain,

261
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,350
because the rain is on my side.

262
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,470
Takumi, you don't look too sharp.

263
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,800
Are you sure you'll be okay in the rain?

264
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,310
Who knows?

265
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:23,010
I can't go too fast in the rain,
so I'll drive normally.

266
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:26,680
Who knows if I'll be fast or slow?

267
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,680
I'll take it easy,

268
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,950
'cause if I crashed, my dad would kill me.

269
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,680
That's true.

270
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:40,030
<i>But if he loses this race,</i>
<i>there won't be a race against...</i>

271
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,120
<i>...Ryosuke Takahashi!</i>

272
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,970
I'll count down!

273
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,070
Five... Four...

274
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,000
Three... Two...

275
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,500
One... Go!

276
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,150
Ouch!

277
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,940
This isn't... normal!

278
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:40,350

293
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,700
<i>Yes, I am confident.</i>

294
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,000
<i>I'll win because Keisuke is watching me.</i>

295
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,400
<i>But even Keisuke lost to this Eight-Six.</i>

296
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,370
<i>I'm avenging that loss! This is for Keisuke.</i>

297
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,640
<i>--This is your first time here...</i>
<i>--No problem!</i>

298
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,710
<i>I have to give it my best for Keisuke!</i>

299
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:49,250
<i>Kenta, do you have feelings for Keisuke?</i>

300
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,680
<i>I, uh...</i>

301
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,890
<i>Next on Initial D: "The Rainy Downhill."</i>

302
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,650
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
