31
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,530
He pushed me from behind at a corner...

32
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,930
That punk did it again!

33
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,460
Darn...

34
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,770
I'll do it.

35
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,940
Duct tape or whatever,
I'll accept the challenge!

36
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,700
Takumi, wait up!

37
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,370
Takumi?!

38
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,880
Oh, I'm sorry.

39
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,150
Don't let him drag you into it.
This whole thing is ridiculous!

40
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,780
Don't do it, Takumi!

41
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,840
I won't lose, no matter what.

42
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,860
"Act 14: Evolving Drift!"

43
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,960
Welcome!

44
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,730
Welcome! Come this way, please!

45
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,490
Regular or super unleaded?

46
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,900
Welcome!

47
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,140
Can I empty the ashtray for you?

48
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,510
What? Takumi is doing
the duct tape death match?

49
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,640
That's definitely not a good idea.

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,840
He snapped because of Itsuki.

51
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,980
I understand his feelings, but it's reckless.

52
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,020
Today is Saturday. Where is Takumi?

53
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,850
He's off today,

54
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,490
and Itsuki is in the hospital,
so we're short-handed.

55
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,490
I know Takumi is good,

56
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,330
but I don't know about
a duct tape death match.

57
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,530
After work, I'll go convince him not to do it.

58
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,700
We gotta make him stop.

59
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,870
Yeah.

60
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,040
Mind helping me out a little?

61
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,340
Welcome!

62
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,840
<i>Without a sense of justice,</i>
<i>the world would be in darkness...</i>

63
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,050
<i>I can't blame Takumi for his choice.</i>

64
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,120
<i>No one can stop him now.</i>

65
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,020
<i>What if we let him?</i>

66
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,010
<i>No. It's too risky against an FF.</i>

67
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,430
I was surprised. This is the
first time you've called me.

68
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,910
I've been upset about something.

69
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,440
I was thinking, and suddenly thought of you.

70
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,380
Somehow I felt relaxed...

71
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,750
I'm glad you called.

72
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,390
How is Itsuki, by the way?

73
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,490
He was wearing a seatbelt
and isn't as bad as he looks,

74
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,120
but they still have to do some more tests.

75
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,930
I should go see him.

76
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,730
He would be happy to see you.

77
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:11,480
"Souvenir"

78
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,840
You're scaring me a little today, Takumi.

79
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,350
Oh, sorry!

80
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,280
You seem different.

81
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,750
But I like you like this, too.

82
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,990
"Takahashi"

83
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,130
Hey, brother!

84
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,510
--What's wrong?
--The Eight-Six of Mount Akina

85
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,380
took the duct tape death match challenge

86
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,850
from the Night Kids' Number Two.

87
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,850
--What?
--His opponent is an EG6.

88
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,180
What's he thinking?

89
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,520
A duct tape death match is an FR killer.

90
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,860
It's common sense that it heavily favors an FF.

91
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,560
It's common sense...

92
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,960
...but he is racing.

93
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,630
When he races, common sense
goes out the window.

94
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,970
Should we check it out?

95
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,080
Hello...?

96
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,310
We're closing. The fried tofu is all sold out.

97
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,420
No, we didn't come for... is Takumi home?

98
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,750
Takumi?

99
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,590
He took the Eight-Six and left this afternoon.

100
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,750
No idea where he went.

101
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:39,070
Bunta... have you done a
duct tape death match before?

102
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,500
Yeah, a long time ago.

103
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,940
What if Takumi did it?

104
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,270
Takumi?

105
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,680
Well, he's still a beginner,

106
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,080
so he might end up going down the cliff.

107
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,920
Let's look other places, Iketani.

108
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,020
Yeah.

109
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,050
Sir, if he comes home,

110
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,220
please convince him not to do it.

111
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,950
Thank you very much.

112
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,870
A duct tape death match...

113
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,550
Let's get going, Shingo.

114
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,080
Yeah.

115
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,240
<i>Don't worry, Eight-Six of Mount Akina.</i>

116
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,910
<i>The victory is 100% mine.</i>

117
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,000
<i>You'll end up at the bottom of the cliff.</i>

118
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,640
I'll see you.

119
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,760
Call me, okay?

120
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,450
Sure.

121
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,760
Now...

122
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,550
A lot of people are here.

123
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,550
I was hoping for a small crowd.

124
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,890
After all, we came to talk him out of it.

125
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,220
Here come the Night Kids!

126
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,650
I only see you and your slow S13.

127
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,220
Where is the Eight-Six?

128
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,890
Ignore him.

129
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,390
I wonder where Takumi is?

130
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:24,660
It's almost time. He should
be here any minute.

131
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,400
Here comes the Eight-Six of Mount Akina!

132
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,890
Fujiwara Tofu Shop?

133
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,920
What is this?

134
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,230
Takumi, it's not too late.

135
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,740
Don't do this ridiculous race!

136
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,140
Why?

137
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,310
I won't lose to someone like him.

138
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,550
He drives an FF! Don't you know that?

139
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,710
Wait... you're the punk from the other night.

140
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,980
You wasted my time.

141
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,490
What are you babbling about?

142
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:23,590
I hope you're not discussing backing down.

143
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:27,550
Iketani, I'm doing this no matter what.

144
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,170
It's 10:00...

145
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,660
It's almost starting.

146
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,680
I believe in you, Takumi. You can win.

147
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,580
Please win!

148
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,600
Will he be okay?

149
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,500
Shouldn't we have stopped him by force?

150
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,700
All we can do now is believe in him.

151
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,200
It's set.

152
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,710
They've set up the finish line.

153
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,110
It's time to start.

154
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,840
Okay.

155
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,620
I'll count down! Ten seconds...

156
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,120
Eight... Seven... Six...

157
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,120
Five... Four...

158
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,160
Three... Two... One...

159
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,720
Go!

160
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,900
It's started...

161
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,840
Stay calm, Takumi.

162
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,850
Shingo purposely eased up on
the gas pedal to stay behind.

163
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,550
So that he can watch the
Eight-Six go down the cliff.

164
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,220
No human can drive an FR under
this rule without crashing it.

165
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,820
That Eight-Six won't last three corners.

166
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,270
<i>Don't be cocky.</i>

167
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,600
<i>The B-16A engine is the best there is.</i>

168
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,610
<i>If I wanted, there's no way</i>

169
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:22,580
<i>I'd be behind a 4A-G engine at the start.</i>

170
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,670
<i>I just wanna see how many</i>
<i>corners you can clear.</i>

171
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:15,330
But I wonder if he can really
make any of those corners?

172
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,060
Here they come!

173
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,970
Hey, isn't that Eight-Six coming in too fast?

174
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,310
This could get ugly.

175
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,910
<i>Aren't you going slower than usual?</i>

176
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,330
<i>You're enthusiastic,</i>

177
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,030
<i>but aren't you forgetting something?</i>

178
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,640
<i>Here it goes... it's over.</i>

179
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,810
<i>I pulled it out. I'm lucky.</i>

180
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,640
<i>I thought I was gonna sprain my wrist.</i>

181
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,150
He regained control!

182
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,920
Wow! I was sure he'd lost it.

183
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,360
I'm too old for this.

184
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,000
Hey, hey, what happened to your enthusiasm?

185
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,190
I can't just stand here.

186
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,860
Let's follow them!

187
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,530
I don't think so, Iketani...

188
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,400
With our skills, we won't catch up with them.

189
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,470
I'm not trying to catch up with them.

190
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,740
In case something bad happens to Takumi,

191
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,140
we can reach him quicker.

192
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,200
Hey, wait for me!

193
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,980
I'm getting the hang of this.

194
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,030
<i>How is he...?</i>

195
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,130
<i>He continues to clear the</i>
<i>corners with little counter.</i>

196
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,830
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

197
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:13,670
<i>A duct tape death match</i>
<i>can't be mastered instantly.</i>

198
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,340
<i>The safer you try to go,</i>

199
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,740
<i>the deeper you sink-- just like an ant-lion trap.</i>

200
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,910
<i>I had to train myself for hours</i>
<i>before I finally mastered</i>

201
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:28,910
<i>cornering with my right hand</i>
<i>duct-taped to the wheel.</i>

202
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,360
<i>On a straight line, engine power is crucial.</i>

203
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,370
<i>No NA 10-6DOHC engine in the world</i>

204
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,860
<i>can out-perform the B-16A.</i>

205
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:55,380
<i>The sound of revving up to the red zone...</i>

206
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,850
<i>It's ecstasy! It's to die for!</i>

207
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:20,370
<i>You see? I can pass you whenever I want.</i>

208
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,870
<i>Maybe you should panic a little.</i>

209
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,070
<i>Let's get going!</i>

210
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,140
"Skate Center"

211
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,080
My heart speeds up before each corner

212
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,950
with anticipation that the crushed Eight-Six

213
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,450
may suddenly appear.

214
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,060
Hey, don't say that!

215
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,630
I'm sure it'll end without any disaster...

216
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,830
Yeah, but...

217
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,660
...Takumi's abilities surprise me every time.

218
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,990
<i>I can keep the speed up nicely...</i>

219
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,980
<i>It's faster not to steer</i>
<i>too much when cornering...</i>

220
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,500
<i>Darn, why?</i>

221
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,640
<i>He's unaffected by my pressure.</i>

222
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,310
<i>He was unstable at the beginning,</i>

223
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,470
<i>but he gets sharper as we go.</i>

224
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,650
They'll be here soon.

225
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:47,650
It sounds like both are still in one piece.

226
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:51,490
If he couldn't reach this spot,
I'd be wrong about him.

227
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:55,360
That Eight-Six wouldn't be a worthy target.

228
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,960
There!

229
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,000
Oh, no! Someone is coming up!

230
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,650
He four-wheel drifted through one lane

231
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,990
without crossing the center line.

232
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,590
What technique!

233
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:24,360
He did it like it was nothing.

234
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,700
He didn't panic about passing by a car, either.

235
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,530
Is his hand really taped to the wheel?

236
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,770
Maybe it came off a long time ago.

237
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:40,670
Perhaps he adapted to the situation quickly.

238
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,080
You mean...

239
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,880
You can attack a corner

240
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,680
by shifting the weight without steering.

241
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,780
He learned that quickly.

242
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,220
He's unreal.

243
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,950
Without a doubt, he is evolving.

244
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,630
<i>Darn, what a fake!</i>

245
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,530
<i>It'll be hard to label him</i>
<i>as a fake if he keeps that up.</i>

246
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,040
<i>But I'm not like Nakazato.</i>

247
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,870
<i>All I have to do is win, no matter what it takes.</i>

248
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,550
<i>Don't feel bad.</i>

249
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,950
<i>The Eight-Six of Mount Akina</i>
<i>will simply turn into metal junk.</i>

250
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,970
Wow! After a spin, he turned 360 degrees

251
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,170
and started driving again
as if nothing ever happened.

252
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:25,810
<i>He got lucky. Pure luck.</i>

253
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:31,390
<i>Darn, he would've been done</i>
<i>had it been a high-speed corner.</i>

254
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,690
<i>That's all right. The victory is mine anyway.</i>

255
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,660
<i>I hate that you're still going,</i>

256
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,160
<i>but I'm too familiar with</i>
<i>the rules to lose this race.</i>

257
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,030
<i>I'll leave you behind.</i>

258
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,190
<i>I'm pissed off! He did that on purpose.</i>

259
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:10,350
<i>I refuse to lose to scum like you!</i>

260
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,430
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

261
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,460
<i>Sou tanin wa kaizai shinai</i>

262
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,030
<i>Never stop, tomaritakunai</i>

263
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,100
<i>Gisei ni natta ai ga cry shite mo</i>

264
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,900
<i>Peak mezashite, sweep the winding street</i>

265
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,100
<i>Beep beep! Keikokuon wa so cheap!</i>

266
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,570
<i>Sheep-tachi wa michi wo akero</i>

267
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,970
<i>'Cuz I'm never gonna stop, streak my dream</i>

268
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,940
<i>Easy na motivation subete wa simulation</i>

269
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,980
<i>Nigetemitatte doko demo safety zone</i>

270

<i>Nani ka wo te ni irete nani ka wo wasureteku</i>

<i>Rage your dream, yami o harisaite iku</i>

275
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,340
<i>Like a streak to the peak</i>

00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:43,480
<i>Sekaijuu no kogekitta yoru o keshiteku</i>

277

<i>Rage your dream, michi o hiraiteku</i>

278
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:50,020
<i>Di-ding down, another round never slow down</i>

279
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,030
<i>Konma zero-ichibyou de knockdown</i>

280

<i>Yoin nokoshikietekou to the next town</i>

<i>Something they would know</i>

<i>Rage your dream, tsuzuku hatenai michi wo</i>

<i>I won't forgive him...</i>

291
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,570
<i>I don't want to lose to him...</i>

292
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,070
<i>Is that you, Takumi?</i>

293
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,740
<i>I won't forgive him...</i>

294
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,740
<i>I don't want...</i>

295
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,040
<i>...to lose to him!</i>

296
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,710
<i>Anyhow...</i>

297
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,150
<i>Next on Initial D...</i>

298
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,850
<i>"Takumi's Fury!"</i>

299
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,980
<i>I won't lose...</i>

300
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,020
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
