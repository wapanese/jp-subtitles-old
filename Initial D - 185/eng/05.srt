<i>Let's move into the brand new world</i>

<i>Let's dive into the brand new trip</i>

19
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,830
<i>Frightened by the wide world</i>

20
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:10,100
<i>We've just begun, now we go</i>

21
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,500
<i>We will shine around the world</i>

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,270
<i>Trip to the world</i>
<i>Yo! Here we go unknown world</i>

23
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,340
<i>We newborn travelers</i>

24
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,540
<i>The unfamiliar walk is still charming</i>

00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,410
<i>The place you want to go is under your feet!</i>

26
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,750
<i>So many people in this world</i>

27
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,180
<i>It's not as if there isn't</i>
<i>backstabbing once in a while</i>

28
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,020
<i>Let's warp past these boring things</i>

29
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,520
<i>And go straight to our reason for living</i>

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,540
<i>That's our law!</i>

31
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,040
<i>He's caught up with me?!</i>

32
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,200
<i>What's happening? I must be going crazy!</i>

33
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,550
This is the straightaway
in front of the skating rink.

34
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,680
The two of them just passed!

35
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,650
He's on Keisuke's bumper!

36
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,920
Akina's Eight-Six is unbelievably fast!

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,190
Keisuke's FD has never had
anyone keep up with it this far!

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,730
Man, I've got goosebumps...

39
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,670
Great attack!

40
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:24,070
That Eight-Six's attack was aggressive.
It was an incredible kamikaze technique!

41
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,940
<i>My old man...</i>

42
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,280
<i>Unless I pass that car,</i>
<i>he won't admit that I won...</i>

43
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,450
<i>There's no other way...</i>
<i>I guess I have to do that...</i>

44
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,390
<i>A full tank of gas is riding on this...</i>

45
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,760
<i>The setup point is in the next</i>
<i>five consecutive hairpin curves!</i>

46
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:48,590
"Act 5: Dogfight!"

47
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,480
<i>Damn!</i>

48
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,860
<i>What's going on? Of all days,</i>
<i>today the FD feels extremely slow!</i>

49
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,730
<i>Is the secondary turbine still working?</i>

50
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,700
This is the top of the mountain.
Can you hear me?

51
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,340
Ryosuke?

52
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,640
Pretty soon,

53
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,140
the two will reach the five
consecutive hairpins up there.

54
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,470
Give me the play-by-play.

55
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,310
Tell me what's happening in
as much detail as possible.

56
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,680
Okay. They're very close to us now.

57
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,980
I can hear the sound of tires
squealing. They'll be here soon!

58
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,320
Here they come!
Keisuke's FD! And the Eight-Six!

59
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,190
They're neck and neck!

60
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,400
Wow! Great! That Eight-Six is amazing!

61
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,400
It did a perfect braking-drift!

62
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,430
Keisuke is losing ground.

63
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,240
His recovery is great, too!
It's so close to the guardrail!

64
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,610
They're going into the second
hairpin! There's no gap now!

65
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,280
Recovery is the same for both of them!

66
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,030
The FD got close to the outside!
The Eight-Six is...!

67
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,630
<i>The hairpin is coming!</i>
<i>But he's not slowing down!</i>

68
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,600
<i>What is he thinking?</i>

69
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,210
The Eight-Six is going into the
hairpin at an incredible speed!

70
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,400
Are his brakes out?!

71
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,710
What's that?!

72
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,390
Keisuke was passed! Easily on the inside!

73
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,330
That can't be true...

74
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,400
We don't understand
what's happening! Be exact!

75
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,400
But...we were watching it...

76
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,840
...and a car shouldn't be able to turn

77
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,010
at a speed exceeding the tire's grip, right?

78
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,840
But that Eight-Six turned in a weird way.

79
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,580
It was kind of like a roller coaster,
even though that line was

80
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,850
supposed to be bad on the inside turn.

81
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,010
I have no idea what happened!

82
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,620
I know what the Eight-Six did.

83
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,130
What?

84
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,630
It's a stupid thing, but no one can imitate it.

85
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,870
And it can happen only here on Akina.

86
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,030
I can't believe anyone would
try something so stupid.

87
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,010
<i>I've got something to look forward to...</i>

88
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:24,150
<i>Akina's downhill specialist...</i>
<i>You will be beaten by...</i>

89
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,580
<i>...me, Takeshi Nakazato of the Myogi Night Kids!</i>

90
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,760
This is the finish line! I can
hear the sound of their engines!

91
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,520
They're almost here!

92
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,530
Here they come! Which one's in the lead?!

93
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,760
It's the Eight-Six!

94
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,760
Wow! What's going on?!

95
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,230
Keisuke's FD is coming, too!

96
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,070
But there is too much of
a gap for him to cover!

97
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,090
The Eight-Six easily wins!

98
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,840
<i>Crap!</i>

99
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,540
<i>My FD beaten by an Eight-Six?!</i>

100
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,680
<i>That's impossible!</i>

101
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,770
<i>350 horses defeated by a shabby Eight-Six?!</i>

102
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,450
The Eight-Six just crossed the finish line!

103
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,120
Keisuke has lost!

104
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,960
We did it!

105
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,180
<i>Am I having a nightmare?</i>

106
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,480
<i>I lost to an Eight-Six?! Twice?!</i>

107
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,990
Wow! He won! That spacey Takumi!

108
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,190
Great! It's too cool! I'm totally numb.

109
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,230
I feel like I'm going crazy.

110
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,270
--He did it!
--Yeah!

111
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,370
Iketani! Don't cry! You idiot!

112
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,340
I don't know why... But I'm happy...

113
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,870
Let's take lessons from him...

114
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,980
Like drift control, and picking a line...

115
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,280
Let's put the Speed Stars' sticker
on it without him knowing!

116
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,450
Oh! I volunteer to do that! Iketani!

117
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,790
All right. I'll count on you...!

118
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:17,660
It was a clear loss.
Let's admit it with some grace.

119
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,630
How about the timed run
for the uphill, Ryosuke?!

120
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,530
The uphill doesn't mean anything.

121
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:27,300
By tomorrow, rumors will
spread among the street racers

122
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:33,240
that the undefeated Red Suns
lost to an Eight-Six from Akina...

123
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,980
We will have to get even soon...

124
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,170
...with my FC.

125
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,250
A full tank of gas...

126
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,020
That's what you promised.

127
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,520
You promised!

128
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,000
I see... He won...

129
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,230
I knew he would win even
before the race began...

130
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:37,300
This right is where I was
passed by the Eight-Six.

131
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,370
I just don't get it.

132
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,700
How could the Eight-Six,

133
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,440
which isn't good on inside corners,
go through it faster than my FD?

134
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,740
Just remembering it gives me the creeps.

135
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,080
He may be a real ghost...

136
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,490
Keisuke...

137
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,950
Tell me exactly what happened at that time.

138
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,720
Was there anything strange?

139
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,660
Come to think of it, I heard a
strange sound. Like scraping!

140
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,690
A strange sound?

141
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,540
I see... Now I understand.

142
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,040
What?

143
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,440
Should I tell you why you lost?

144
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,730
He used this.

145
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,030
--A drainage ditch?
--Yes.

146
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,600
He dropped his inside tires
into the ditch on purpose

147
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,370
and resisted the centrifugal
force by hooking it.

148
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,570
In that way, it is theoretically possible to gain

149
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,440
more cornering force than the tires can grip.

150
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,720
It is too obvious and simple,
and it's a ridiculous idea.

151
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,850
It wouldn't be successful
if he'd never done it before.

152
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,420
I assume that he probably
practices like this regularly.

153
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,550
He must have run Akina for many years.

154
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,660
Damn!

155
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,870
The mountain downhill is fun

156
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,840
because this kind of thing happens.

157
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,870
It's been a while

158
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:26,200
since I've met a target that
I can get excited about.

159
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:31,510
Let's cancel the expedition
we were planning for next week.

160
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,680
Until we have a complete victory
at Akina, we can't move on.

161
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,020
I'll beat the Eight-Six!

162
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,900
"Green Shopping Street"

163
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,240
Bunta! Are you in?!

164
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,240
"Closed Today"

165
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,940
It's me!

166
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,410
Oh, it's hot.

167
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,580
Oh, it's Yuichi...

168
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,340
Good timing!

169
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,180
I have a meeting at the Chamber of Commerce.

170
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,520
Sorry to bother you,
but can you give me a ride?

171
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,850
What? Are you using me as a taxi?

172
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,430
I heard Takumi was great...

173
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,760
Iketani and the others have been
excited about it all morning.

174
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,030
It's not particularly great.

175
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:30,340
I've heard that the expectations
of kids these days are pretty low.

176
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,540
He doesn't like driving cars.

177
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,740
Is that right? I can't believe it.

178
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,210
He has such a great technique.

179
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:44,350
To him, driving a car equals
helping with my business.

180
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,350
I've forced him to do it
since he was in junior high,

181
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,720
so he can't imagine that driving is fun.

182
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,390
I see...

183
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:56,730
He's somewhat cynical about it.

184
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:00,430
But the chase on the
downhill of Akina last night

185
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:04,200
might have given him
something to feel passionate about.

186
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,480
Speaking of which, I didn't see the Eight-Six...

187
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,240
Where is Takumi?

188
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,910
I don't know what's going on,

189
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,410
but he went somewhere
this morning in a good mood.

190
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,950
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

191
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,480
Wow! It's cold!

192
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,150
Takumi, you're...

193
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,850
...a very good driver.

194
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,590
Really?

195
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,820
To tell you the truth, I usually get carsick.

196
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,090
So I brought medicine for it.

197
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:37,670
But I didn't feel sick at all
when you were driving.

198
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,930
This is the first time I didn't get sick

199
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,560
after being in the car for so long.

200
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,710
Do you ride in cars that often?

201
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:51,250
Oh... not that often...

202
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:56,950
Just when my family goes
out and my father drives...

203
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,990
<i>She is strange...</i>

204
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,560
<i>I was just driving like I usually do</i>

205
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,390
<i>so I don't spill the water in the paper cup.</i>

206
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,000
<i>It was strange yesterday...</i>

207
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,010
<i>The car running in front of me</i>
<i>was getting closer and closer,</i>

208
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,640
<i>and the next thing I knew...</i>

209
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,080
<i>...I found myself getting a</i>
<i>charge out of chasing it.</i>

210
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:51,070
<i>I've never thought driving was fun before...</i>

211
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,680
<i>Even today, when I was</i>
<i>driving with Mogi next to me,</i>

212
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,750
<i>it was a lot of fun.</i>

213
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,770
<i>Driving isn't that bad...</i>

214
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,450
Hey, Takumi.

215
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,820
Hey! Hello!

216
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,460
You were daydreaming just now.

217
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,890
Were you spacing out?

218
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,030
You're rude, Takumi.

219
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,330
When a person has a cute girl with him,

220
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,970
do you think he should be off
in his own little world? Really!

221
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,870
Sorry! What did you say?

222
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:28,900
I just asked if you have a girl you like.

223
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,140
I don't have anyone in particular...

224
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,150
Although I do have someone I
can't help thinking of a little...

225
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,490
How about you?

226
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,190
I also have...

227
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,650
...someone I can't help thinking of a little.

228
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,700
What are you saying? Don't be a copycat.

229
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,310
Boy!

230
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,550
I don't know how many times

231
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,850
I was asked the same thing this morning.

232
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,490
"Who was in that Eight-Six yesterday?"

233
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,790
I was asked many times, too.

234
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,890
Anyway, he beat Keisuke Takahashi.

235
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,160
It's no surprise that people are talking.

236
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
I got a little carried away...

237
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,170
I told everyone that the Eight-Six was

238
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,330
the secret weapon of the Speed Stars.

239
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,170
We have to find a way to get
Takumi to join the Speed Stars.

240
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,040
Otherwise, we'll be embarrassed later.

241
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,340
Iketani! Leave it to me!

242
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,010
Because I'm his best friend,

243
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,810
I'll make him do it.

244
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,550
Are you sure, Itsuki?

245
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,350
Of course!

246
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,750
I know his weak points, too...

247
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,230
But in return, please let
me join the Speed Stars!

248
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:57,360
If Takumi will join us, you're in. Right?

249
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,270
Yeah...

250
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,800
Lucky! The negotiation was successful!

251
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,640
But how are you going to get a car?

252
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,640
I'm glad you asked!

253
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,640
I've already made up my mind!

254
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,780
Oh! You've finally saved up the money!

255
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:17,550
I'll ask my dad to sign for me
and get a loan for an Eight-Six!

256
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,290
Takumi has a Panda Trueno,

257
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,990
so I'll look for a red or black Levin...

258
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:25,030
...and someday we'll be
called the Eight-Six Pair,

259
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,360
the fastest in Akina.

260
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,670
But, Itsuki...

261
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:37,470
...Takumi's Eight-Six is not a normal Eight-Six.

262
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,710
That's right.

263
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:43,580
It was faster than the FD
with 350 horsepower...

264
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,810
It must have incredible tuning.

265
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,820
I'd like to take a peek under the hood.

266
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,260
Instead of that, why don't you go along

267
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,230
when he goes for Akina's downhill record?

268
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,200
Wow! That's a good idea!

269
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
I want to ride, too!

270
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,930
We can go where no one has gone before!

271
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,000
--I can't even imagine it...
--Yeah...

272
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,540
I bet it's greater than any
extreme roller coaster.

273
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,380
Yeah...

274
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,680
Crap! Right now, Takumi is...!

275
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,430
"Beach House"

276
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,560
Wait a minute! Takumi!

277
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,280
Excuse me! Could you take our picture?

278
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,870
All right.

279
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,050
What's this? We're going to take a photo?

280
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,950
We came all this way. It's for our memories.

281
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,990
Smile! Smile!

282
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,890
Here we go.

283
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:05,830
Excuse me! One more!
Please take one more picture!

284
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,190
That's enough...

285
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,250
Never mind, never mind!

286
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,460
Oh! That white FC!

287
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,520
That's Ryosuke Takahashi.

288
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,630
Finally, Red Suns' No. 1 showed up!

289
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,730
What for?

290
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,130
Must be revenge for his brother.

291
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,100
Can you think of anything else?

292
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,700
That was just yesterday!
He came here already?!

293
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,230
He must be really mad about being
beaten by the Eight-Six. I wonder...

294
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,040
That's an R32 I've never seen here.

295
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,210
A black R32...

296
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,320
Something about it makes me shiver...

297
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,080
Who is that?

298
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,460
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

299
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,530
<i>So no one intervenes</i>

300
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,060
<i>Never stop, I don't want to stop</i>

301
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,130
<i>Even if you cry because of a sacrificed love</i>

302
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,930
<i>Aim for the peak, sweep the winding street</i>

303
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,140
<i>Beep beep! The warning chime is so cheap!</i>

304
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,600
<i>The sheep should clear the road</i>

305
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,040
<i>'Cuz I'm never gonna stop, streak my dream</i>

306
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,910
<i>Easy motivation is total stimulation</i>

307
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,980
<i>You tried to escape,</i>
<i>but anywhere is a safety zone</i>

308
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,990
<i>Something is within your grasp</i>
<i>and something is forgotten</i>

309
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,920
<i>Even if the world ends it will never change</i>

310
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:24,000
<i>Beasty shout, no one can touch you</i>

311
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,370
<i>Cross over now to the time of an intense dream</i>

312
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,410
<i>Rage your dream, split the darkness</i>

313
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,380
<i>Like a streak to the peak</i>

314
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:43,520
<i>Erase the freezing darkness worldwide</i>

315
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,390
<i>Rage your dream, and open the road</i>

316
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,060
<i>Di-ding down, another round never slow down</i>

317
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,060
<i>A point 01 second knockdown</i>

318
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,260
<i>Reverberations left behind,</i>
<i>disappear to the next town</i>

319
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,100
<i>The losers are left in the dust</i>

320
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,060
<i>Let's ignore the constraints of logic</i>

321
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,030
<i>'Cause they're a pain</i>

322
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,170
<i>A streaker runs naked across the street</i>

323
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,370
<i>Something they would know</i>

324
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,410
<i>Rage your dream,</i>
<i>continue on the unending road</i>

325
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,410
<i>Don't look back on your love or your past</i>

326
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:15,480
<i>Go forward and you'll shine brightly</i>

327
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,550
<i>Rage your dream, you're living in the now</i>

328
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,760
<i>Damn! You traitor, Takumi!</i>

329
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,830
<i>All of a sudden you're strolling in!</i>

330
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:37,400
<i>He went to the ocean with Mogi</i>
<i>and without me, his best friend!</i>

331
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,410
<i>You wanted to see Natsuki</i>
<i>in her swimsuit, didn't you?</i>

332
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,110
<i>Of course!</i>

333
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,210
<i>Takumi was alone with her.</i>

334
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:48,680
<i>He must have done something</i>
<i>with her! I'm sure of it!</i>

335
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:53,890
<i>Next time on Initial D!</i>
<i>A new battle is in the air...</i>

336
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,520
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
