40
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,740
Iketani got in an accident?

41
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,040
When did it happen?

42
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,610
Last night, he hit a guardrail
while coming down Akina.

43
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,850
Was he hurt?

44
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,550
Not too badly...

45
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,420
It's only minor whiplash...

46
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,360
...but he's really upset about the whole thing.

47
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,190
I heard his car is pretty messed up.

48
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,930
Then what about the meet on Saturday?

49
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,230
It's hopeless...

It's all right for you to go out?

55
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,380
I'm okay. How's my car?

56
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,820
It's in the back garage, but we
still haven't done anything.

57
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,750
We can't do anything until the parts arrive.

61
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,970
You got in an accident?

62
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,930
Yes.

63
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,300
The meet is pretty soon. What will you do?

64
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,540
I came to ask you a favor
about that, Mr. Fujiwara.

65
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,680
--A favor?
--Yes.

66
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,210

67
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,680
...can you please drive in my place?

68
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,580
I beg you, Mr. Fujiwara!

69
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,390
Ouch!

70
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,850
My neck...!

71
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,590
Don't die.

72
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,730
Mr. Fujiwara, I'm sure you
know how a street racer feels.

73
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,530
I can't let the local drivers lose.

74
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,570
Hey, even if an old guy
like me went out there,

75
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,440
he would just be out of place.

76
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,770
I grew up racing on Akina.

77
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,710
Those Akagi Red Suns obviously
are making fools of Akina's drivers.

78
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,410
I can't stand it!

79
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,580
I want to show them that Akina
has a street racer with true skill!

80
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,390
Mr. Fujiwara, you are the one who can do it!

81
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,720
You have already defeated Akagi's
fastest, the Takahashi Brothers.

82
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,350
I beg you, Mr. Fujiwara.

"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

86
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,840
Don't be rude. High octane, fill it up.

87
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,710
How cheeky. You want me to put
high octane in that Eight-Six?

88
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,520
It must have been you, Yuichi.

89
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,190
You told the weird rumor to that kid, Iketani.

90
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,690
Sure. It wasn't a lie either.

91
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,330
So what about it?

92
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,660
He came again today,

93
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,230
with a bandage on his head and a neck brace.

94
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,000
He asked me to drive in his place.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Well, I can't say that I hate that kind of guy.

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,710
If you don't hate him,
then why don't you do it?

97
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,080
Iketani is a good guy.

98
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,550
No, thanks.

99
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,850
I don't want to go sticking my
nose into these kiddie fights.

100
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,450
That's not my style.

101
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:01,320
So then it's all right if a kid
shows up at a kiddie fight, right?

102
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,220
Are you talking about Takumi?

103
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,560
That's right.

104
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,660
He's gotten pretty good, right?

105
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,630
He still has a ways to go...

106
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:14,170
If it's Akina's downhill,
he wouldn't lose to anybody.

107
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,500
Well, except me, of course.

108
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,710
Your competitive spirit is showing.

109
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,040
I wonder where he got his
stubborn nature from...

110
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,050
But even if I order him to go race,
that won't make him want to.

111
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,020
Well, because of those
bandages on Iketani's head,

112
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,350
I'll try to think of a good strategy.

113
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,840
A promise should never be broken.

114
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,010
There are only two kinds of people that I hate.

115
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,840
People who break their promises
and people who smoke.

116
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,580
I want to use the car this Sunday.

117
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,980
Sunday... you can't.

118
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,480
Why not?

119
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,050
I'll take care of the morning delivery.

120
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,820
That's not the problem.

121
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,560
I need to use it to go to
a town meeting on Sunday.

122
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,660
Really? This is bad...

123
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,160
I really need the car on Sunday.

124
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,840
It must be a girl.

125
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,410
None of your business.

126
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,840
Quit being so stubborn. Just let me use it.

127
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,180
It's just a crappy old car...

128
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,050
I'll take it if I want to.

129
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,510
A car won't move without a key.

130
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,180
I'll put it on a string and
wear it around my neck.

131
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,320
Not fair!

132
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,220
If you really want it that bad,
I'll think about it.

133
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,360
Really?

134
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,530
But there is a condition.

135
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,200
Condition?

136
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Saturday night, go meet some brat
who's known as the fastest on Akagi

137
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,370
and beat the pants off him

138
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,370
on Mt. Akina's downhill.

139
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,040
What?

140
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,710
If you do that, you can use
the car with no conditions,

141
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:03,110
and you'll get a full tank of gas.

142
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,100
Full tank of gas?

143
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,380
<i>Full tank of gas...</i>

144
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,150
<i>This offer is truly irresistible.</i>

145
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,720
<i>I'm out of money, too.</i>

146
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,020
What're you going to do?

147
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,690
Well, let me think a minute.

148
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,460
Fine, take all the time you need.

149
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,330
"Takahashi"

150
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,150
I'm coming in.

151
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,720
Keisuke, good timing.

152
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,190
I wanted to ask you something.

153
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,190
What is it, brother?

154
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,900
The Eight-Six that you saw on Akina...

155
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,030
Can you describe the speed of the car,

156
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,200
theoretically speaking?

157
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,800
Oh, gimme a break.

158
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,170
Unlike you, I'm not good at that kind of stuff.

159
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,810
Like I always say,

160
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,980
the most important part
of driving technique is here.

161
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,510
Whenever you battle somebody,

162
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,120
you can stay behind them and
learn whatever you want to know.

163
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,490
From your opponent's habits and weaknesses

164
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,890
to how well their suspension is set up.

165
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:24,390
Your ability to analyze is almost scary.

166
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,360
In my opinion, the fact that
you can drive without thinking

167
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,030
and still keep up with me

168
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,500
means that you're the one who's truly scary.

169
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,700
If you could apply theories to your skill,

170
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,840
you'd be the ideal driver.

171
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,910
I lost because I didn't know
the road and I was careless.

172
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,810
I've never been disgraced like this before.

173
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,910
The inside of that Eight-Six must be a monster.

174
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,020
A monster, you say?

175
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,180
This is getting more interesting...

176
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,910
Tomorrow is the meet.
Maybe I should go and watch.

177
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,930
Takumi!

178
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,200
Saturday has arrived!

179
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,930
What about it?

180
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,540
What do you mean,
"What about it?"Today is the meet!

181
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,250
The meet with the Akagi Red Suns!

182
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,520
You promised that you'd borrow the
Eight-Six and we'd go watch, right?

183
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,220
Sure. Speaking of which...

184
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,390
This is getting a bit complicated.

185
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,290
What did you say?

186
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,700
You'd better not be trying to tell me
that you don't have the time...

187
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,770
No, that's not the reason...

188
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,230
If you back out at the last minute,

189
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,900
you can kiss our friendship goodbye.

190
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,970
Every day I've counted the days
on my fingers, waiting for today.

191
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,780
I know.

192
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,780
Excuse me!

193
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,780
Fried tofu, please.

194
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,150
Oh, it's you again.

195
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,280
You don't give up, do you...

196
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,550
Mr. Fujiwara, I beg you.

197
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,490
At today's meet...

198
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,060
I might do it...

199
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,170
I might do it, that's what I said.

200
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,570
On Akina tonight...

201
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,940
Honestly?!

202
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,610
Ouch... My neck...

203
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,010
Hey, are you okay?

204
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,280
Are you really going to come?

205
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,080
I can't say for certain, but...

206
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,550
...I would say there's about a 50/50 chance.

207
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,190
What time does it start?

208
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,620
The gathering begins at eight o'clock,

209
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,620
but the time attack begins at ten.

210
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,390
Ten o'clock...

211
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,900
If an Eight-Six hasn't shown up
by ten, you can give up on waiting.

212
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,470
You'll have to do it on your own.

213
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,640
I'll be waiting, Mr. Fujiwara.

214
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,300
I have faith that you'll definitely come.

215
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,470
It's not definite. I said it's 50%.

216
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,710
No, you've already decided to come.

217
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,580
Our team will be waiting for you!

218
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,180
Well, then, Mr. Fujiwara...

219
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,710
We'll be waiting for you on
the top of Akina at 10 o'clock.

220
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,440
<i>I just can't be cold to an eager guy like him.</i>

221
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,670
<i>If Takumi won't do it, then should I go?</i>

222
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,270
<i>No, no, I shouldn't. I'm getting excited.</i>

223
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,970
Did something fun happen?

224
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,200
You seem different today.

225
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,910
Really?

226
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,480
Aren't I always like this?

227
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,750
You look happy about something.

228
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,880
Actually, I'm going to the ocean
with my friend tomorrow.

229
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,750
I'm really excited about it!

230
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,250
Friend? You mean a boy?

231
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,590
What? Of course not! I'm going with a girl!

232
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:19,330
I see. Well, let's go to the department store,

233
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,500
and I'll buy you a new bathing suit.

234
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,930
It's okay. I already bought one on my own.

235
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,070
I don't need two of them.

236
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,170
I'd like to see you in your bathing suit.

237
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,040
That's funny!

238
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,010
You've already seen everything.

239
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,910
You're such a perv, Papa!

240
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,010
I wonder if tomorrow will be sunny.

241
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,520
Don't ask me such a stupid thing.

242
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,550
The weather is great all over Japan.

243
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,120
Are you going somewhere?

244
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,620
I'm going to the ocean.

245
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,020
Ocean?

246
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,690
What?!

247
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,730
I'm jealous! I want to go to the ocean, too!

248
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,030
Could it be...?

249
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:00,300
You're going with a girl?! A girl?!

250
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,640
Sort of...

251
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,140
Who is it? Do I know her?

252
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,240
Is she cute? Does she have big ones?

253
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,140
She's very cute.

254
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,910
Natsuki... Mogi...?

255
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,320
Yeah.

256
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,050
It's cruel of you not to tell me.

257
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:22,320
Sorry, but the situation didn't
give me a chance to invite you.

258
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,990
Next time, okay?

259
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,930
Please don't cry.

260
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,670
What's going to happen at today's battle?

261
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,370
I heard that the Red Suns have
won every battle they've been in.

262
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,610
The outcome is already obvious.

263
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,080
Akina will be totally defeated.

264
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,050
However, the fastest team in
Gunma is not the Red Suns...

265
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,680
It's us, the Myogi Night Kids.

266
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,520
Takeshi, it's about time.

267
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,680
Yeah, let's go.

268
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,030
<i>Born with only the purpose of running fast...</i>

269
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,460
<i>A pure thoroughbred... the R32.</i>

270
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,900
<i>It won't lose to Akagi's dumb rotaries.</i>

271
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,210
<i>Amazing.</i>

272
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,810
<i>The mountain is lit up like a festival.</i>

273
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,980
<i>Rumors about this battle</i>
<i>between Iketani's team</i>

274
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,320
<i>and Akagi's fastest team</i>

275
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,010
<i>have spread all over the place.</i>

276
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,490
<i>Which side will win?</i>

277
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,700
<i>Takumi's Eight-Six is Bunta's Eight-Six.</i>

278
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,400
<i>It can't lose.</i>

279
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,560
<i>It's been a while since I've gotten this excited.</i>

280
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,510
Wow, so many people!

281
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:57,120
I've never seen such a huge crowd on Akina.

282
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,620
The Red Suns brought them all
here to show off their speed.

283
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,130
If we lose tonight, we'll be humiliated.

284
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,130
By the way, the Eight-Six that
you were telling us about...

285
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,000
Is it for real, Iketani?

286
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,570
Yes.

287
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,670
I don't have any faith in that Eight-Six.

288
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,840
I heard that Keisuke Takahashi's FD3S

289
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,210
is lightly tuned for mountain driving.

290
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:24,040
But even still, there is a rumor
that it's putting out over 350 HP.

291
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,350
The difference in power is too great.

292
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,250
Even on the downhill, there's
no way an Eight-Six can compete!

293
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,720
Iketani, are you sure you
didn't hit your head too hard?

294
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,520
An Eight-Six is an Eight-Six,

295
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,360
but this is not a normal Eight-Six.

296
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,360
Keisuke Takahashi said it himself...

297
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,830
On the outside, it's a normal panda Trueno,

298
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:46,370
but inside, it's a monster machine.

299
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,840
Trust me.

300
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,100
I'm sure he will come.

301
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,340
If he doesn't come...?

302
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,950
There is a huge crowd here.

303
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:02,480
I don't want them to say
the Speed Stars ran away.

304
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,950
If he doesn't come...

305
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,690
If he doesn't come...?

306
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:11,360
Kenji, represent our team and drive like hell!

307
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,990
You must be joking.

308
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,070
A bunch of cars are coming.

309
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,500
You can hear the rotaries.

310
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,330
The Red Suns!

311
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,510
They're here! The Red Suns!

312
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,480
<i>They're finally here.</i>

313
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,070
Wow, the Takahashi Brothers are so popular.

314
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:03,140
I heard that their father owns
a big hospital in Takasaki.

315
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,980
You can't win against the rich...

316
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,610
Driving skill is determined

317
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:12,220
by how much you can spend
on gasoline and tires.

318
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,350
"Hill Top Seki Touge Transport"

319
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,890
What the hell is Takumi doing?!

320
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,560
The meet is starting!

321
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,670
Even though I really made sure...

322
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,970
That stupid Takumi...! Idiot! Jerk!

323
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,840
You're not my friend anymore!

324
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,540
That hurt!

325
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,340
I can't wait anymore!
I'll have to go on my scooter.

326
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,510
Let's begin the time attack at 10 o'clock,

327
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,850
according to schedule.

328
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:45,690
It should be easier since it's late
and there aren't many other cars.

329
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,190
We'll use radios at the start and finish points

330
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,860
in order to time the runs.

331
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,890
In order to allow the drivers to run
full-bore and as fast as they want,

332
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,730
officials will be placed at the blind corners,

333
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,700
and in the event of oncoming traffic,

334
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,400
we will use lights to signal the driver.

335
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,700
I see.

336
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,970
Seems like they've done this a lot.

337
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:07,510
Yeah. They probably do
time attacks everywhere.

338
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,280
Well, now that I've said that,

339
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,980
let's enjoy some free runs until 10 o'clock.

340
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,470
The galleries are packed.

341
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,830
The Eight-Six hasn't shown up.

342
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,330
I wonder why...

343
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,170
Do they intend to conceal their
secret weapon until the last moment?

344
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,680
What is it? Starting to feel like going?

345
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,410
Sure, but I don't really want to.

346
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,720
Why not? You've got no
confidence that you'll win?

347
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,550
Drive like you normally drive,
and you won't lose.

348
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,230
It's here!

349
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:05,260
Keisuke's FD3S!

350
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,240
Incredible! Such a fast entry speed!

351
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,340
Next is Ryosuke Takahashi!

352
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,780
Run! Look out!

353
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,070
That's Ryosuke Takahashi for you.

354
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,470
His skill is the real thing.

355
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,150
Amazing! They can get
so close without hitting?

356
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,420
That's their signature Parallel Drift!

357
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,860
Approaching the other car
is the toughest part.

358
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,190
During the drift,

359
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,860
if you lack the skill to freely
change your speed and line,

360
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,560
then you can't do it.

361
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,930
But this is just a performance.

362
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:17,230
Driving for time attack is different!

363
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,390
<i>You still haven't come, Ghost of Akina.</i>

364
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,560
<i>My only opponent is you.</i>

365
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,860
<i>Show yourself, Eight-Six!</i>

366
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,560
"Green Shopping Street"

367
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,410
Do I need a paper cup today?

368
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:59,910
You don't need it. You're not
carrying any tofu in the back.

369
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:03,850
This isn't a regular delivery,
so play as hard as you can.

370
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,320
Full tank of gas, don't forget.

371
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,390
I know, I know.

372
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:10,020
Well, I'm going.

373
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,720
Okay.

374
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,460
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

375
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,530
<i>So no one intervenes</i>

376
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,060
<i>Never stop, I don't want to stop</i>

377
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,130
<i>Even if you cry because of a sacrificed love</i>

378
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,930
<i>Aim for the peak, sweep the winding street</i>

379
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,140
<i>Beep beep! The warning chime is so cheap!</i>

380
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,600
<i>The sheep should clear the road</i>

381
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,040
<i>'Cuz I'm never gonna stop, streak my dream</i>

382
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,910
<i>Easy motivation is total stimulation</i>

383
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,980
<i>You tried to escape,</i>
<i>but anywhere is a safety zone</i>

384
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,990
<i>Something is within your grasp</i>
<i>and something is forgotten</i>

385
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,920
<i>Even if the world ends it will never change</i>

386
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:24,000
<i>Beasty shout, no one can touch you</i>

387
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,370
<i>Cross over now to the time of an intense dream</i>

388
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,410
<i>Rage your dream, split the darkness</i>

389
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,380
<i>Like a streak to the peak</i>

390
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:43,520
<i>Erase the freezing darkness worldwide</i>

391
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,390
<i>Rage your dream, and open the road</i>

392
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,060
<i>Di-ding down, another round never slow down</i>

393
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,060
<i>A point 01 second knockdown</i>

394
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,260
<i>Reverberations left behind,</i>
<i>disappear to the next town</i>

395
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,100
<i>The losers are left in the dust</i>

396
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,060
<i>Let's ignore the constraints of logic</i>

397
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,030
<i>'Cause they're a pain</i>

398
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,170
<i>A streaker runs naked across the street</i>

399
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,370
<i>Something they would know</i>

400
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,410
<i>Rage your dream,</i>
<i>continue on the unending road</i>

401
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,410
<i>Don't look back on your love or your past</i>

402
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:15,480
<i>Go forward and you'll shine brightly</i>

403
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,550
<i>Rage your dream, you're living in the now</i>

404
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,660
<i>Okay, today's guest is famous</i>
<i>for his aggressive driving.</i>

405
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,830
<i>Member of the Red Suns,</i>

406
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,430
<i>--Keisuke Taka--!</i>
<i>--Give me that!</i>

407
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,170
<i>Hurry up and show yourself, Ghost of Akina!</i>

408
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,700
<i>Maybe you got scared and ran away?</i>

409
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,070
<i>Well, do you think you'll win this time?</i>

410
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,340
<i>Shut up! Of course I will!</i>

411
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,380
<i>Whatever it takes, I'll get my revenge!</i>

412
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,950
<i>Next time on Initial D, finally, "Into the Battle!"</i>

413
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,220
<i>Who will win?</i>

414
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,920
<i>It's a high tension battle</i>
<i>between the FD and Eight-Six!</i>

415
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,720
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
