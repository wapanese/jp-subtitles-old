5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,670
<i>Get ready, yo! Now we blow up the horn</i>

6
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,460
<i>In the silver smoke amidst the frozen city</i>

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,130
<i>Payback for a dream I've seen so many times</i>

8
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,800
<i>My body is frozen in a</i>
<i>memory that I can't shake</i>

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,570
<i>Slam on the accelerator and deceive myself</i>

10
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,710
<i>Broken in the night</i>

11
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,910
<i>My eyes become sharper</i>

12
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,050
<i>All from someone's whim</i>

13
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:00,290
<i>It seems like the world will end any minute</i>

14
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,160
<i>Break into the night, it's the time</i>

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,830
<i>With scared eyes, I'm lost in the night</i>

16
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,460
<i>Embraced by a falling dream</i>

17
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,100
<i>Scared of being alone, missin' my heart</i>

18
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,910
<i>Even hurting myself</i>

19
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,610
<i>Love me so much,</i>
<i>enough that I could fall apart</i>

20
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,250
<i>If only I could throw everything away</i>

21
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,920
<i>And just love you</i>

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,320
<i>Then I know I could face the truth</i>

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,690
--Takumi, it's for you.
--Who's it from?

24
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,460
Ryosuke Takahashi.

25
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,860
What?!

26
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,630
Ryosuke...

27
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,360
...Takahashi.

28
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,170
<i>Less power, but fast!</i>

29
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,340
<i>He clears the corners faster.</i>

30
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,970
<i>There's no way my brother will lose to him now!</i>

31
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,480
A battle?

32
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,680
--Yeah.
--Is that like a fistfight?

33
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,990
No, a "battle" is a car race.

34
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,820
If you don't want to race, just ignore him.

35
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,460
It's not that I don't want to.

36
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,860
I may lose to him,

37
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,970
but I don't want to not race him.

38
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,030
You still don't think Takumi can win?

39
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:25,340
No. I know he's exceptional,
but he's still in high school.

40
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,350
I wonder how long he'll even
be able to stay in the race.

41
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:35,180
<i>The only reason I think Takumi has a chance...</i>

42
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,090
<i>...is that he's Bunta's son.</i>

43
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,750
<i>The son of that crazy Bunta...</i>

44
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,090
Keisuke...

45
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,730
I've been thinking about this for a long time,

46
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,530
but when I lose a street race...

47
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,340
--...I'll retire.
--What?!

48
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,910
By the way, there are only two racers

49
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,210
who I think could beat me one day.

50
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,750
One of them is you, Keisuke.

51
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,250
Me?

52
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,410
And the other is...

53
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:37,270
"Act 25: The Last Battle!"

54
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,300
Takumi!

55
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,230
Good luck, Takumi!

56
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,470
I believe in you! I know you can win!

57
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,270
And I hope you beat Ryosuke Takahashi

58
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,270
and become the fastest
racing star in Gunma, Takumi!

59
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,570
Takumi!

60
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:10,580
Okay, we got it, Itsuki! Now get off of him!

61
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,080
You're late.

62
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,080
It's already 10:00.

63
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,580
You're still so ignorant.

64
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,480
I've been waiting for you.

65
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:53,660
It's impressive that you've
learned so much technique

66
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,120
at such a young age.

67
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:02,530
I've just driven Akina Pass more
than others, so I'm used to it.

68
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,860
I don't have any special technique.

69
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,910
I think you are just overestimating me.

70
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,980
That's interesting.

71
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,650
I guess you don't really
understand your own potential.

72
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,380
What?

73
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,680
You're so unique.

74
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,520
It'll be nice to sit down
and talk to you someday.

75
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,540
Big brother...

76
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,740
Let's get started.

77
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,010
This should be a fun evening.

78
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,010
All right! Move your cars!

79
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,880
Yes, sir!

80
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,060
Is it all right if we Red Suns run this race?

81
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,220
Sure.

82
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,860
Get some guys from Speed
Stars to be officials, too.

83
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,630
--Got it.
--Iketani, I'll be at the goal.

84
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,890
All right. Do a good job!

85
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,970
Keisuke, I'll be at the five hairpins.

86
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,210
Okay.

87
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,210
Of course Ryosuke will win, won't he?

88
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,980
We're going to get our revenge, right?

89
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,280
Of course we are.

90
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,880
No matter how fast that guy is,
there's no way my brother will lose.

91
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,980
You're right. Okay, I'm off!

92
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,650
Hello, Fujiwara Tofu-- Oh, it's you.

93
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,250
Hey, Bunta. I just got to Akina.

94
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,590
There's a huge crowd over here.
You'd be amazed if you saw it.

95
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,460
Yeah, and...?

96
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,030
So, what do you say?

97
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,460
Do you think Takumi can win this?

98
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,800
I hear that his opponent is
Gunma's fastest, a street racing king.

99
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,170
Who cares?

100
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,800
If you don't have something
else to say, I'm hanging up.

101
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,940
Hey, Bunta!

102
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,280
Wait a minute, Bunta!

103
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,710
I told you not to hang up!

104
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,870
All right! How are the corners looking?

105
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,830
Okay! The first corner is ready whenever.

106
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,150
Skate Center here.
This straight section looks good.

107
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,350
The 17th hairpin is ready anytime.

108
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,560
Five hairpins here.

109
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,490
No cars around here, and we're ready!

110
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,000
This is Number Six.

111
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,160
We've moved all the
spectators' cars. We're ready!

112
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,960
I'm so nervous!

113
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,590
My throat is completely dry,

114
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,300
and my heart is pounding out of control!

115
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:00,230
The air around this whole
pass is filled with tension.

116
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,930
I wonder if Takumi is feeling all right?

117
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,070
<i>Takumi...</i>

118
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,280
<i>You're racing against the best.</i>

119
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,250
<i>It doesn't matter if you lose. Just do your best!</i>

120
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,050
<i>Come on, Takumi!</i>

121
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,140
<i>I know you can win this!</i>

122
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,730
<i>There's no way my brother will lose.</i>

123
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,500
<i>But something always happens</i>

124
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,330
<i>in Akina Pass when that Eight-Six is racing.</i>

125
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,690
Excuse me. What's happening with the race?

126
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,490
It hasn't started yet.

127
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,980
Oh, I see. Thank you.

128
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,770
This is the starting line.

129
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,700
How does it look at the finish line?

130
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,200
Yeah... we're ready here anytime.

131
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,310
Okay! Let's get going!

132
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,970
Hold on a minute!

133
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,650
Let me do the countdown.

134
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,710
Just for this race. Okay?

135
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,530
<i>I have to do the countdown for this race</i>

136
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,020
<i>between my big brother</i>
<i>and the Eight-Six myself.</i>

137
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,500
I'm starting the countdown!

138
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,710
Five... Four...

139
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,680
Three... Two... One...

140
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,380
Go!

141
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,360
Go, Takumi!

142
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:52,130
All right! Takumi's going right by him!

143
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,750
Takumi is ahead of him now!

144
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,380
Takumi! Keep going!

145
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,960
<i>That's my big brother's strategy.</i>

146
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,400
<i>He always lets them get ahead at first,</i>
<i>and then catches them later.</i>

147
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:20,430
<i>That's how he's been winning his races.</i>
<i>His "fastest racer" theory can't go wrong!</i>

148
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,950
They're both amazing!
Extremely close twin drifts!

149
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:13,550
Using that much drift isn't
Ryosuke Takahashi's style at all!

150
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,720
What a show, right from the beginning!

151
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,980
Even Ryosuke Takahashi
started using drift right away!

152
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,380
I bet he wants to beat Takumi
using Takumi's specialty,

153
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,980
just to show the willpower
of a street racing king!

154
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,920
Takumi is doing great, too!
This is going to be an amazing race.

155
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,720
Wow, Takumi! You've got to win! Go Takumi!

156
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,860
Right, Iketani?

157
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,990
Um... right...

158
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,840
<i>How impressive...</i>

159
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,930
<i>The Eight-Six has never driven like this before.</i>

160
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,360
<i>I knew it. He has improved!</i>

161
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,310
<i>He uses very little</i>
<i>counter-steering as he stabilizes</i>

162
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,310
<i>in the final moment of drift.</i>
<i>That hasn't changed.</i>

163
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:50,220
<i>But he counter-steers less</i>
<i>right after a turn-in maneuver.</i>

164
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,790
<i>I don't understand.</i>

165
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,990
<i>It hasn't been that long since the last race,</i>

166
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,130
<i>and his weakness is already gone.</i>

167
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,490
<i>He is improving in every race.</i>

168
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,500
<i>I need to change the scenario a bit...</i>

169
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,340
<i>...but that's all.</i>

170
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,310
<i>The result will be the same.</i>

171
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,830
<i>My "fastest racer" theory is invincible!</i>

172
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,580
Hey, Takeshi...

173
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:26,250
Let me just tell you that I didn't park
here just because your car was here.

174
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,850
Don't you make any mistake about that.

175
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,490
I was planning to park here
before I even arrived.

176
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,360
Why don't you go away?

177
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,770
No way! I also knew that this was
the only spot to watch the race.

178
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,330
You're the one who should go away.

179
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:49,610
All the beginners usually want to
watch it from such obvious places...

180
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,150
...like the five hairpin curves.

181
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,550
Right.

182
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,280
The race isn't decided in a spot like that.

183
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,990
This is the only point where
they could go for the win.

184
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,990
So, that's what you think too, huh?

185
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,630
Let me just say that you're impressive.

186
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,560
You, too.

187
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,730
So, this place is really deserted, huh?

188
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,570
If someone sees us here,

189
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,700
they'll think we're friends.

190
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,410
Shoot! How annoying!

191
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,650
Here they come!

192
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,370
Whoa! They're both getting
so close to the guardrail!

193
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:05,120
Oh, my god! That was amazing!

194
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,350
Whoa! What am I waiting for?!

195
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,260
I've got to tell him.

196
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,450
How annoying...

197
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,970
--Hello, Fujiwara...
--Hey, Bunta! Are you listening?!

198
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,770
Heck, it's you again.

199
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,940
Listen hard!

200
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,740
They just passed in front of me.

201
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,150
They were both drifting very hard,

202
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,710
with Takumi's Eight-Six ahead

203
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,150
and the FC right behind him.

204
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,550
Takumi was ahead?

205
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,090
That's not good...

206
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,790
Not good? Why?

207
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,660
Calm down a little, Yuichi.

208
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,830
It's more advantageous to chase
the other car than to run from it.

209
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,440
That's common sense.

210
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,270
That's true.

211
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,780
The rear driver can study the course
and rhythm of the other driver.

212
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,520
If he's skilled enough,
he can also copy the driving.

213
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,190
But maybe he can also just drive away.

214
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,820
The driver in front is
under tremendous pressure.

215
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,510
Having another car follow
you at the same speed

216
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:35,940
gradually pushes you into a mental corner.

217
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,320
The harder you try to get away,
and the longer you're followed,

218
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,010
the more threatening your opponent seems.

219
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:56,730
On top of that, Takumi is still
new to such racing tactics.

220
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:00,670
I'm sure he's really freaking out by now.

221
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,700
You think so?!

222
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,170
Anyway, I'll give you a call
later with the outcome.

223
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,800
All right.

224
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:14,580
That boy... Will he lose?

225
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,310
Maybe not...

226
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,240
Here they come!

227
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,120
This is incredible!

228
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,660
This is the 24th corner.

229
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,900
The Eight-Six and
Ryosuke's FC just passed here.

230
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:42,340
We've checked the time, and it's just amazing!

231
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,140
If they hold this pace, they'll break
the Eight-Six's course record...

232
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,580
...by seven or eight seconds!

233
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,740
Anyway, that's my report.

234
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:56,320
<i>Seven to eight seconds faster</i>
<i>than when I raced against him?</i>

235
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,490
<i>Give me a break!</i>

236
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:03,020
<i>Is this what happens when my</i>
<i>big brother gets really serious?</i>

237
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,660
<i>This is starting to get scary.</i>

238
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,360
<i>This race is going to become legendary.</i>

239
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,670
It looks like Takumi is still in the lead!

240
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,170
All right! He can win this thing, right, Iketani?

241
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,200
Yeah. But I wonder how
long he can keep this up?

242
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,680
--What?!
--That's Ryosuke Takahashi he's racing against.

243
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:28,280
I'll be happy if Takumi can
just finish this race safely.

244
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:56,170
<i>I'm going at full power,</i>
<i>and he's right on my tail!</i>

245
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,640
<i>No matter how fast I go, I still can't get away!</i>

246
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:08,420
<i>It's no good... I might lose this race.</i>

247
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,490
<i>Ryosuke Takahashi...</i>

248
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,530
<i>I can't even compare to such a great racer!</i>

249
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,600
<i>I really don't want to...</i>

250
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,570
<i>...but I'm going to lose!</i>

251
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:40,350
<i>There was a time when I</i>
<i>wandered aimlessly, tired of love</i>

252
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:48,200
<i>I lost sight of myself and gave in to desire</i>

253
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,600
<i>But destiny is ever-changing</i>

254
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:02,240
<i>And charmed by innocent eyes</i>

255
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:10,150
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I hold you ever so tightly</i>

256
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:16,960
<i>All I can say is that I believe</i>
<i>my feelings are true</i>

257
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,130
<i>Let's enjoy our happiness...</i>

258
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:29,230
<i>Into our shining future</i>

259
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:48,860
<i>We'll prove countless times...</i>

260
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:54,930
<i>Our passion will last for eternity!</i>

261
00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:01,600
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I embrace you ever so tightly</i>

262
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:08,440
<i>Even if I lose everything that I have,</i>
<i>I will never let you go</i>

263
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,680
<i>Bloom, my beautiful...</i>

264
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:20,050
<i>...and miraculous flower</i>

265
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,890
<i>--You know...</i>
<i>--I don't want to lose.</i>

266
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,500
<i>--Fujiwara Tofu...</i>
<i>--This race...</i>

267
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,170
<i>--His sense for drift...</i>
<i>--I don't want to lose!</i>

268
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,540
<i>Ryosuke, I...!</i>

269
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,340
<i>--Takumi, go!</i>
<i>--You can't lose...</i>

270
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,070
<i>Just like that!</i>

271
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,410
<i>Keep going!</i>

272
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,170
<i>Win!</i>

273
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,710
<i>Heading towards the conclusion</i>
<i>of this emotional race...</i>

274
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:52,820
<i>Next on Initial D: "The New Downhill Legend!"</i>

275
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,810
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
