<i>Now we gotta start let's get move!!</i>

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,820
<i>Let's move into the brand new world</i>

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,060
<i>Let's dive into the brand new trip</i>

19
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,830
<i>Frightened by the wide world</i>

20
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:10,100
<i>We've just begun, now we go</i>
<i>full speed and funky beat</i>

21
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,500
<i>We will shine around the world</i>

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,270
<i>Trip to the world</i>
<i>Yo! Here we go unknown world</i>

23
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,340
<i>We newborn travelers</i>

24
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,540
<i>The unfamiliar walk is still charming</i>

25
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,410
<i>The place you want to go is under your feet!</i>

26
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,750
<i>So many people in this world</i>

27
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,180
<i>It's not as if there isn't</i>
<i>backstabbing once in a while</i>

28
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,020
<i>Let's warp past these boring things</i>

29
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,520
<i>And go straight to our reason for living</i>

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,540
<i>That's our law!</i>

31
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,800
<i>What's going on? I'm so tense I could die.</i>

32
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,030
<i>I wanna go to Mt. Akina so bad.</i>

33
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:51,470
<i>I'm not really sure if I love</i>
<i>driving that much, but...</i>

34
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:56,950
<i>For the past five years, come rain or snow,</i>

35
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,280
<i>I've driven Mt. Akina more often than anyone.</i>

36
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,690
Anyway, that's the story.
So I'm taking the car, Dad!

37
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,930
You'd better hurry, Takumi! It's almost time.

38
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,700
--It's him!
--He's here!

39
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,070
<i>Oh, no! They found me!</i>

40
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,880
It's too late to run.

41
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,240
<i>I'm dead!</i>

42
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,030
What the hell are you doing

43
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,900
sitting in the middle of the road, Itsuki?

44
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,700
Ta... Ta... Ta...

45
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,930
Get out of my way! I'm gonna run you over.

46
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,140
Takumi! You came!

47
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,380
Yeah.

48
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,850
Sorry, Itsuki... for being late.

49
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,420
Takumi...!

50
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:15,260
A street racer should race
if he's challenged, right?

51
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,520
Takumi...!

52
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,020
Wait... don't...

53
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,930
"Act 9: Battle to the Limit!"

54
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,030
<i>Jeez, he's young!</i>

55
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:57,230
<i>Bet he hasn't even had his</i>
<i>license for more than a year!</i>

56
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:03,340
<i>Where'd a kid like this learn his technique?!</i>

57
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,540
<i>I thought for sure I'd be</i>
<i>facing a guy older than me!</i>

58
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,850
<i>So that's a GT-R...</i>

59
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:20,660
<i>It's beyond amazing.</i>
<i>That car's in a class by itself.</i>

60
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,590
<i>Its driving system combines everything</i>
<i>good about FR and four-wheel drive.</i>

61
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,930
I'm Nakazato... one of the Night Kids.

62
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,200
What's your name?

63
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,700
Takumi Fujiwara.

64
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,440
I'll remember that.

65
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,030
What do you say we get started?

66
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,410
--Who do you think's gonna win?
--Nakazato, of course!
--R32!

67
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,080
Now you tell me

68
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,420
that heavy understeer during full throttle
is the better setting if you have skills,

69
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,460
but if maneuverability is suddenly different,

70
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,590
don't you think Takumi's going to
panic when he charges into corners?

71
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,360
Maybe you should've warned him...

72
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,230
It wouldn't have done any good.

73
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:10,140
He's not exactly a driver
who drives with his head.

74
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,880
What?! Then all the more reason to tell him!

75
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,410
It's all right.

76
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,510
You don't have to worry.

77
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,320
See, he might not be too sharp upstairs...

78
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,720
..but his body and his senses are finely tuned.

79
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,850
It's too late to think first and react

80
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,190
to the information you feel
on your back through the seat.

81
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,930
Your arms and legs have to move
unconsciously to control drifting.

82
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,530
That's why you don't need to worry!

83
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,370
He has this great sense of knowing
when and how to accelerate

84
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,000
while the car is drifting.

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,200
So even if the suspension
setting is a little different,

86
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,770
it won't matter to him in the least.

87
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,870
He'll make minor adjustments

88
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,840
and just ride it out.

89
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,570
See, the Eight-Six is a car that trains its driver.

90
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,620
Here's the goal.

91
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,610
The road's clear of regular traffic,
so anytime you're ready...

92
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,690
Iketani! We can go anytime!

93
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,200
All right!

94
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,400
I'm gonna start the countdown!

95
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,560
Start in ten seconds.

96
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,050
Takumi! I'm counting on you!

97
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,220
Keisuke...

98
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,420
We're gonna have the best seats
in the house for tonight's battle!

99
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,860
Now hop in! They're about to start!

100
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,990
5...

101
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,920
4... 3...

102
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,260
2... 1...

103
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,920
Go!

104
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,040
The R32 is ahead!

105
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,060
Yeah, but Takumi's not too far behind!

106
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,940
Here they come!

107
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,440
Get your seat belt on!

108
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,160
Hey! That's the FC.
Ryosuke Takahashi just dashed out!

109
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,360
Is he trying to horn in on the race?!

110
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,630
What the hell...?! Is it going
to be a three-way super battle?

111
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,160
Suddenly, it's turned into a
race for the fastest in Gunma!

112
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,640
<i>The GT-R driver... He's slowing down...</i>

113
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,090
<i>Is he waiting for me?!</i>

114
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,390
<i>It'd be a waste to lose</i>
<i>him on the straightaway.</i>

115
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,230
<i>I wanna have a battle here!</i>

116
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,690
<i>The real starting line comes</i>
<i>as soon as we hit the first corner!</i>

117
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,670
Hey, look at that!

118
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,480
Nakazato's easing up on the gas
and waiting for the Eight-Six!

119
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,010
Hope his overconfidence

120
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,610
doesn't end up costing him
in the last half of the race!

121
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,880
Here they come!

122
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,380
The first corner... and all
three cars, taking it in a row!

123
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,900
<i>Wow! Just like Bunta said!</i>

124
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,200
What the hell...?!

125
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,740
No way, mister!

126
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,010
Pulling stunts like that

127
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,530
ain't gonna get you caught up to me!

128
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,640
Getting to eyeball it from this close up...

129
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,950
That drift looks just like a work of art!

130
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,680
A four-wheel drift in full throttle, and
he's barely applying the countersteer!

131
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,290
Do you realize how incredible that is?!

132
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:22,020
He's pushing that Eight-Six to its outer limits

133
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,360
and controlling it like it was
his own hands and feet!

134
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Even I can't control the FC like that!

135
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,800
It's exciting!

136
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,200
Yeah, maybe, but little by little,
Nakazato is gaining ground!

137
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,470
Can the Eight-Six win this one?!

138
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,710
<i>Yes! This is it!</i>

139
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,880
<i>It's like I can feel the blood</i>
<i>rushing through my veins!</i>

140
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,190
<i>This is the battle I've been waiting for!</i>

141
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,190
<i>Ready, boy? I'm really gonna cut loose now!</i>

142
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,380
<i>Let's see how far you can keep up!</i>

143
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,840
<i>Hey...</i>

144
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,240
<i>Something's different...</i>
<i>Something's different with the car!</i>

145
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,710
<i>Even if I floor the gas,</i>
<i>the car doesn't lose control.</i>

146
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,580
<i>Does this mean I can step on</i>
<i>the gas sooner than before?</i>

147
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,390
<i>When I was at work today,</i>
<i>did Dad fiddle with it?!</i>

148
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,920
<i>'Cause it sure wasn't like this</i>

149
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,420
<i>when I made the deliveries this morning!</i>

150
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,030
<i>Now I get it!</i>

151
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,060
<i>That's why he was out before!</i>
<i>He was working on this!</i>

152
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,730
<i>Don't know why...</i>

153
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,100
<i>But anyway, it does feel</i>
<i>a whole lot better this way!</i>

154
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,800
<i>Because it doesn't slide too much...</i>
<i>I can push it all the way!</i>

155
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,150
--Yow!
--Amazing!

156
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,450
That's some un-freakin'-believable drifting!

157
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,400
That's the first time I've seen a guy
drift all the way through that corner!

158
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,870
Yeah, he's nuts!

159
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,270
He'd never be able to do it if he didn't
have total mastery over his speed!

160
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,770
What the heck was that?!

161
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,510
That's no kind of drift I've ever seen before!

162
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,010
Incredible! That's drifting I'll never forget!

163
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,840
Man, oh, man!

164
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,280
The Eight-Six is still on the R32's tail!

165
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,740
He's doing it!

166
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,310
Looks like Takumi's sticking
right behind the R32!

167
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,810
Mind-blowing!

168
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,350
I mean, Nakazato's an ace...

169
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,680
Line him up with Ryosuke
Takahashi, another superstar,

170
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,220
and you got a battle royal brewing already!

171
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,690
And my best friend's racing against
both of 'em?! Unbelievable!

172
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,390
I mean, that is too cool!

173
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,400
Well, yeah, but...

174
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,930
...Ryosuke Takahashi and his
FC aren't even in the race.

175
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,240
He's acting more like a third-person witness.

176
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,270
Right. Takumi's up against Nakazato here.

177
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:28,240
His R32 has the Eight-Six at a disadvantage...

178
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,710
But with Takumi at the wheel,
the Eight Six'll pull through in the end!

179
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,750
Oh, yeah. Takumi will take it, for sure!

180
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,180
Right, guys!

181
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,200
He's creeping further and further away!

182
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,440
Nakazato's got a big mouth,

183
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,440
but it looks like he's got
the skill to back it up!

184
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,380
Look at how he distributes the load,

185
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,180
subduing the understeer while driving!

186
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,880
He really knows how to
draw out the GT-R's power.

187
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,580
Not pretty to look at...

188
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,890
This is not the time to take it easy.

189
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,390
Hey, bro...

190
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,860
Whose side are you on, anyway?!

191
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,160
If the kid loses this one, it's all over!

192
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,060
The real contest is only about to begin.

193
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,660
The first half has comparatively
more long straightaways...

194
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,330
Lots of gentle slopes, too.

195
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,730
There are lots of
disadvantages for the Eight-Six.

196
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,200
But the inclines are gonna start
getting rougher right around here.

197
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,770
Perfect for a downhill
specialist to strut his stuff!

198
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,690
<i>All right! This kind of low-gear hairpin curve</i>

199
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,960
<i>is right up the R32's alley!</i>

200
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,760
<i>All I gotta do is cut my speed</i>
<i>by slamming on the brakes...</i>

201
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,570
<i>Going downhill, like it or not, the front</i>
<i>wheels still have to bear the load,</i>

202
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,680
<i>so its weakest point, the pushing</i>
<i>understeer, hardly occurs.</i>

203
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,050
<i>Furthermore, accelerating from a low gear</i>

204
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,080
<i>is what this car does better than any other!</i>

205
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,550
<i>The fastest machine on the racing circuit...</i>

206
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,820
<i>...is the toughest machine even on open roads!</i>

207
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,390
<i>The R emblem on the rear</i>

208
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,890
<i>is the legendary symbol for invincibility!</i>

209
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,560
<i>Can you get close enough to read it?!</i>

210
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,070
Hey, Iketani...

211
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,440
What?

212
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,710
I've been thinking.

213
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,340
'Till now, I thought Takumi

214
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,250
was just a unique racer

215
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,750
who's fast only when he's racing on Akina.

216
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,750
But if he raced on a different mountain pass,

217
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,090
how well would he drive?

218
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,590
Don't you wonder about that?

219
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,290
Well, sure, I've mulled it over...

220
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,960
But right now, all I'm thinking
about is the battle at hand!

221
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,560
Win, Takumi!

222
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,360
Takumi!

223
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,080
<i>Oh, man!</i>

224
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,080
<i>My eyes can't keep up with him!</i>

225
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,190
<i>Looks like he's finally kicking out the jams!</i>

226
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,560
<i>His inside tires are gripping the rim of the road!</i>

227
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,530
<i>This is the one! The trick that I lost to!</i>

228
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,900
<i>Didn't think I'd ever get</i>
<i>the chance to see it again!</i>

229
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,110
<i>Ryosuke's stopped with the chatter.</i>

230
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,050
<i>Meaning there's no time for that now?</i>

231
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,690
<i>I've ridden shotgun with him tons of times...</i>

232
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:02,360
<i>But this is the first time I've</i>
<i>seen him driving like this!</i>

233
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,860
<i>I've never seen him so serious!</i>

234
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,020
"Akina Skate Center"

235
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,640
<i>Getting closer...?!</i>

236
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,000
<i>The Eight-Six is catching up to me?!</i>

237
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,700
<i>Impossible!</i>

238
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,440
<i>Brilliant! Catching up to me after all that...</i>

239
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,280
<i>All my prejudices about the</i>
<i>Eight-Six being a 10-year-old car</i>

240
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,940
<i>have just been blown away!</i>

241
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,610
<i>It's a first-rate fighting machine!</i>

242
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,150
<i>Okay, the kid gloves are off!</i>

243
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,890
<i>Man, this is the best rush I've had in ages!</i>

244
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,720
<i>In fact, this has gotta be the</i>
<i>hottest road race I've been in</i>

245
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,520
<i>since getting this car!</i>

246
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,570
<i>When it comes to hairpin turns,</i>

247
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,540
<i>he can't match the R32!</i>

248
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,570
<i>No matter how close the</i>
<i>Eight-Six sticks to the R32,</i>

249
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,710
<i>the distance between them</i>
<i>always widens after a hairpin!</i>

250
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,940
<i>Man, that Nakazato's got guts, too...</i>

251
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:08,380
<i>Attacking the road like that,</i>
<i>downhill in a heavy-ass R32!</i>

252
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,820
<i>Wha-What the...?!</i>

253
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,700
<i>The Eight-Six closed the gap</i>
<i>at the high-speed corner?!</i>

254
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,870
<i>Going over 100 kilometers an hour</i>
<i>while doing a four-wheel drift</i>

255
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,340
<i>close enough to graze the guardrail?!</i>

256
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,280
<i>I don't think any of it has to do</i>
<i>with the car's capabilities!</i>

257
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,780
<i>That guy... has got a screw loose!</i>

258
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,350
<i>If he makes one slip-up, he's roadkill for sure!</i>

259
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,950
<i>But now I understand his secret!</i>

260
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,520
<i>With a lightweight like the</i>
<i>Eight-Six, if he loses speed once,</i>

261
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,020
<i>it takes like forever to get it back up again.</i>

262
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,690
<i>He never lets himself lose a fraction</i>
<i>of speed more than he has to!</i>

263
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,230
<i>Now I finally get why,</i>

264
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,900
<i>when I raced against him,</i>

265
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,800
<i>he could always catch up to me,</i>
<i>no matter how many times I lost him!</i>

266
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,140
<i>Crap!</i>

267
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,940
<i>I can't shake him!</i>

268
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,070
<i>Just the opposite!</i>

269
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,110
<i>He's hanging on to me for</i>
<i>longer and longer periods!</i>

270
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,010
<i>The bastard... is tough!</i>

271
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:34,260
<i>Nakazato's clearing the guardrail</i>
<i>by a good 20-30 centimeters.</i>

272
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,200
<i>No matter how fast you are,</i>

273
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,200
<i>that's about right.</i>

274
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,730
<i>Yet the Eight-Six's bumper</i>

275
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:44,470
<i>is almost close enough</i>
<i>to the rail to make sparks!</i>

276
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,370
<i>That guy's in a league of his own!</i>

277
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,940
<i>How?! How can he control a drift</i>
<i>with that kind of precision?!</i>

278
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,060
<i>Since I've been steering</i>
<i>hard and using the ABS,</i>

279
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:13,070
<i>the load on the front tires has</i>
<i>been a lot heavier than I thought!</i>

280
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:16,040
<i>This race is suddenly getting</i>
<i>much more challenging!</i>

281
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,570
The five hairpins are coming up...

282
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,940
That's where he left you in the dust.

283
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,910
And I bet that's gonna be
a key point this time, too.

284
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,450
<i>An R32 versus an Eight-Six...</i>

285
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,750
<i>Who would've thought the</i>
<i>battle would be this fierce?</i>

286
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,020
<i>Both of those cars are</i>
<i>being taken to their limits.</i>

287
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,250
<i>But which one of them</i>
<i>is gonna take the prize?!</i>

288
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,520
I'm at the hairpins! And I can hear 'em coming!

289
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,460
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

290
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,530
<i>So no one intervenes</i>

291
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,060
<i>Never stop, I don't want to stop</i>

292
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,130
<i>Even if you cry because of a sacrificed love</i>

293
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,930
<i>Aim for the peak, sweep the winding street</i>

294
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,140
<i>Beep beep! The warning chime is so cheap!</i>

295
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,600
<i>The sheep should clear the road</i>

296
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,040
<i>'Cuz I'm never gonna stop, streak my dream</i>

297
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,910
<i>Easy motivation is total stimulation</i>

298
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,980
<i>You tried to escape,</i>
<i>but anywhere is a safety zone</i>

299
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,990
<i>Something is within your grasp</i>
<i>and something is forgotten</i>

300
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,920
<i>Even if the world ends it will never change</i>

301
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:24,000
<i>Beasty shout, no one can touch you</i>

302
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,370
<i>Cross over now to the time of an intense dream</i>

303
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,410
<i>Rage your dream, split the darkness</i>

304
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,380
<i>Like a streak to the peak</i>

305
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:43,520
<i>Erase the freezing darkness worldwide</i>

306
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,390
<i>Rage your dream, and open the road</i>

307
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,060
<i>Di-ding down, another round never slow down</i>

308
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,060
<i>A point 01 second knockdown</i>

309
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,260
<i>Reverberations left behind,</i>
<i>disappear to the next town</i>

310
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,100
<i>The losers are left in the dust</i>

311
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,060
<i>Let's ignore the constraints of logic</i>

312
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,030
<i>'Cause they're a pain</i>

313
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,170
<i>A streaker runs naked across the street</i>

314
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,370
<i>Something they would know</i>

315
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,410
<i>Rage your dream,</i>
<i>continue on the unending road</i>

316
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,410
<i>Don't look back on your love or your past</i>

317
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:15,480
<i>Go forward and you'll shine brightly</i>

318
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,550
<i>Rage your dream, you're living in the now</i>

319
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:30,600
<i>Ryosuke, most expected the R32</i>
<i>to have a great advantage.</i>

320
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:37,000
<i>The R32 is 4,640 mm long and 1,720 mm</i>
<i>wide, and weighs a thousand...</i>

321
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,170
<i>In other words...</i>

322
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:43,780
<i>In other words, the R32 is 4,640 mm</i>
<i>long and 1,720 mm wide...</i>

323
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,580
<i>In other words, traveling</i>
<i>downhill, Takumi might...</i>

324
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,920
<i>In other words, the R32 is 4,640 mm long and...</i>

325
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,090
<i>All right already! Next time on Initial D,</i>
<i>"The 5 Consecutive Hairpins"!</i>

326
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,020
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
