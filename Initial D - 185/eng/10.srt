37
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,100
The five hairpins are coming up...

38
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,370
That's where he left you in the dust.

39
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,200
And I bet that's gonna be
a key point this time, too.

The Eight-Six is right on his tail!

42
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,510
I can't believe Nakazato is
having trouble with an Eight-Six!

43
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,010
There goes the Eight-Six's braking drift!

44
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,080
He's good!

45
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,120
--That was an FC!
--Ryosuke Takahashi...

46
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,900
<i>I saw Keisuke Takahashi</i>

47
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,270
<i>lose the race on these five hairpin turns.</i>

48
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,460
<i>That Eight-Six turns corners using the gutter.</i>

49
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,340
He's definitely not giving
up the inside position!

50
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,980
That's Nakazato.

51
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,210
What are you gonna do, Eight-Six?

52
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,850
Wha...?

53
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,820
What?! From the outside?!

54
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,760
--Watch out!
--He's going to crash into us!

55
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,540
Don't insult me! Not from the outside!

56
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,060
The R32's acceleration is amazing!

57
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,090
What about that Eight-Six?

58
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,660
He slid through that narrow turn.

59
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,630
Three more turns...

60
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,530
...and this race is over.

61
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,420
He's going outside again!

62
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,160
You're irritating me!

63
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,030
Stop messing with me from the outside!

64
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,510
The R32's movement is unsteady.

65
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,110
Nakazato is losing his patience.

66
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,180
--Yeah?
--Watch, Keisuke.

67
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,170
The Eight-Six will make a move.

68
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,050
<i>Make a move?</i>

69
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,450
<i>When there's no room on the inside...</i>

70
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,290
<i>...how can he pass?</i>

71
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,620
Takumi's making a move?!

72
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,180
Are you serious?

73
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,230
--Come on!
--Go for it, Takumi!

74
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,740
<i>This is humiliating. You keep</i>
<i>pushing me from the outside</i>

75
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,210
<i>in front of all these people!</i>

76
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,710
<i>I can't attack the corner because</i>
<i>I'm staying inside too much.</i>

77
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:30,590
<i>One car width should be enough</i>
<i>to keep him away from the inside.</i>

78
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,220
<i>That way, I can go in with more speed!</i>

79
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,190
Good! He's going outside!

80
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,880
<i>The Eight-Six is gone!</i>

81
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,550
<i>It can't be!</i>

82
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,820
<i>What?!</i>

83
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,570
Whoa...

84
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,200
Wow!

85
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,800
<i>Damn it! The understeer is acting up!</i>

86
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,540
<i>He faked going to the outside</i>

87
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,510
<i>and snuck inside while braking!</i>

88
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,720
<i>The Eight-Six can perform tricks like that?!</i>

89
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,220
<i>But the race isn't over yet.</i>

90
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,050
<i>I can still move ahead</i>

91
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,890
<i>in 2nd gear at full blast!</i>

92
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:46,420
<i>I'll show you what my R32 is capable of!</i>

93
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,820
<i>I lost.</i>

94
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,000
<i>My R32 and I lost the race.</i>

95
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,830
<i>No... I lost the race.</i>

96
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,330
<i>My R32 didn't lose to that Eight-Six.</i>

97
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,010
<i>I never thought racers like that existed.</i>

98
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,090
<i>Losing was a shock...</i>

99
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,260
<i>...but somehow I feel satisfied,</i>

100
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,750
<i>because I gave it my best.</i>

101
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,360
Darn...

102
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,600
Another 70,000 yen to fix this.

103
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,170
I'll train harder and try again.

104
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,170
Takumi won the race! He did it!

105
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,320
Guys, he did it!

106
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,660
--Takumi won the race!
--Yeah...

107
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,960
I can't believe it!

108
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,830
The Eight-Six passed the
R32 on the fourth hairpin!

109
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,850
How can an Eight-Six beat a R32?

110
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,140
--That Eight-Six won?
--I still can't believe it!

111
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,380
<i>You were right, Bunta.</i>

112
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,510
<i>You called it.</i>

113
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,190
Wasn't that fun and educational, Keisuke?

114
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:59,490
Yeah, that move the
Eight-Six used was amazing.

115
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,060
He faked going outside

116
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,260
and snuck inside while braking fully.

117
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:11,240
He must have great ABS.

118
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,280
You don't get it, do you, Keisuke?

119
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,450
The Eight-Six doesn't come with ABS.

120
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,010
But...

121
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:23,180
That Eight-Six has human ABS.

122
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,520
Street racers who only drive cars with ABS

123
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,390
can't learn the strict pedal control

124
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,690
required to stop just before the brakes lock.

125
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,870
After all, ABS can't outperform the right foot

126
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,630
of a highly experienced driver like him.

127
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,870
It's been a while since I got that into a race.

128
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:52,310
That Eight-Six is a worthy target for us.

129
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,850
What are you staring at it for?

130
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,750
Nothing...

131
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,250
Hey, Dad, this car...

132
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,030
What about it?

133
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:48,570
Nothing... never mind.

134
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,900
I'm going to bed.

135
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,860
What? How?

136
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,880
I bought an Eight-Six!

137
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,280
I kept it a secret, but it came today!

138
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,450
It's relatively new.

139
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,850
You finally convinced your
dad to co-sign for you.

140
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,190
Well...

141
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,920
The guys at the shop were friendly,

142
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,420
and I think I got a great deal!

143
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,060
Yes!

144
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,560
It's in good shape.

145
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,690
You're lucky.

146
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,900
I can't believe you actually bought it, Itsuki.

147
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,740
I had to, Takumi.

148
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,210
I have to catch up with you, you know?

149
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:03,380
I'll train hard to be your
"Downhill Eight-Six" partner.

150
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,550
I see your mouth got bigger.

151
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,380
I couldn't sleep last night...

152
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,390
...'cause I was so excited!

153
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,890
I know that feeling.

154
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,830
I couldn't sleep the night before I got my S13.

155
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:23,160
I couldn't help it, 'cause it's my own car.

156
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,930
My car... I feel like I'm dreaming...

157
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,270
'70s tires with original hubcaps...

158
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,340
So cool!

159
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,940
Why don't you start it up, Itsuki?

160
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,500
Sure thing!

161
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,460
It doesn't sound too sharp...

162
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,930
It must be because of the original muffler.

163
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:56,130
Don't worry, I'll get a new muffler.

164
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:00,730
I want it to sound as cool as Takumi's Trueno.

165
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,010
I have a bad feeling about this.

166
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,840
Pop the hood, Itsuki.

167
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,490
--I knew it...
--Boss?

168
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,830
You got it all wrong, Itsuki.

169
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,830
What do you mean?

170
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,600
--This isn't an Eight-Six.
--What?

171
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,340
It's an Eight-Five.

172
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:41,240
An Eight-Five... as in AE-85?

173
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,220
An Eight-Six and an Eight-Five
have the same body,

174
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,960
but their abilities are as far
apart as chalk is from cheese!

175
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,060
An Eight-Six has a DOHC engine,

176
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,300
while an Eight-Five has an SOHC.

177
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,500
DOHC and SOHC are
completely different, you know?

178
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,840
Didn't you check the engine
before you bought it?

179
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,740
Stupid!

180
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,980
Sorry, Itsuki, but it's funny...

181
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,140
My stomach hurts!

182
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,320
Itsuki, wait!

183
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
You went too far.

184
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,370
Put yourselves in his position.

185
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,600
We're sorry.

186
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,070
Itsuki!

187
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,740
Just leave me alone, okay?

188
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,080
I can't.

189
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,860
I wanted to surprise you guys...

190
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,630
...but I was an idiot for buying a car by myself.

191
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,130
I knew it was too cheap for an Eight-Six.

192
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:14,970
I'm so embarrassed for acting
like an idiot in front of you guys.

193
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:18,570
I know you're laughing at me inside, too.

194
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,540
You're wrong.

195
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,650
The fact of the matter is, I envy you.

196
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,650
You envy me?

197
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,380
Don't lie!

198
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,380
It's not a lie.

199
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,220
You're still in high school,

200
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,020
and already have your own car.

201
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,830
--My own car...
--Yeah.

202
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,860
So what if it's an Eight-Five?

203
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,260
It has an engine and four tires.

204
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,370
It may not have power,
but it'll go fast downhill.

205
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,830
You can still practice your skills.

206
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,450
Cars are fun...

207
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:04,180
--You've changed...
--Have I?

208
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,160
You weren't into cars as much before.

209
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,890
Takumi, I feel like I can
be proud of my Eight-Five.

210
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:18,730
--I don't deserve an Eight-Six yet.
--You're right.

211
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,570
You don't have to agree!

212
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:26,470
I may go for a spin at Mount Akina tonight.

213
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,040
Wanna come, Takumi?

214
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,050
Sure... in your Eight-Five.

215
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,850
Takumi...

216
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,520
Yippee!

217
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,650
I'll come get you around 10:00 tonight.

218
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,520
--Sure.
--Don't fall asleep!

219
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,860
I didn't see the famous Eight-Six.

220
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,170
I wanna take a look at it.

221
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:57,870
I can't imagine an R32 losing to an Eight-Six.

222
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,390
--That's an Eight-Six.
--Is that him?

223
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:24,800
Wow, that was fun! Akina Pass is the best!

224
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,230
It's slow going straight,

225
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,570
but it corners like the
real thing, right, Takumi?

226
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,200
Sure.

227
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,980
What are you doing?

228
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:45,490
If you look at my Levin from a distance...

229
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,820
...it does look handsome!

230
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,230
My Levin is so cool!

231
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:57,100
I'm glad I bought my Levin!

232
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,070
I'm happy for you, too.

233
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:06,210
--They're kids.
--It can't be them.

234
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,940
The famous racer who beat the R32

235
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,840
couldn't be a little kid!

236
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,850
No way!

237
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,850
How old are you kids?
I hope you have a license.

238
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,190
Otherwise, I'll have to tell the police.

239
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:23,290
Yes, I do! I may look cute, but I'm 18.

240
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,630
<i>Who do they think they are?</i>

241
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,160
--Stop tormenting them.
--I don't like it.

242
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,630
A kid like him is driving an Eight-Six

243
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,740
and acting like a street racer.

244
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,340
You live around here?

245
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,710
Do you happen to know the
famous Eight-Six of Mount Akina?

246
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,580
Don't act dumb. We know you know him.

247
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,580
I, uh, I've heard of him...

248
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,090
...but he probably won't be here tonight.

249
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,320
Darn, we came all this way for nothing.

250
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,990
Let's get out of here.

251
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,530
I tell you what, kid.

252
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:03,700
If you wanna act like a racer,
at least try to look like one.

253
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,340
I mean, look at this
Eight-Six with its ugly wheels.

254
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,740
It's embarrassing!

255
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,670
Pitiful!

256
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,910
And change the muffler,
'cause it sounds pathetic.

257
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:21,850
Don't you know anything
at all about an Eight-Six?

258
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,680
Well, actually...

259
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,390
...this is not an Eight-Six, it's an Eight-Five...

260
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:30,360
...so a new muffler won't make any difference.

261
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,790
I'm thinking of getting one, though...

262
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,920
An Eight-Five?

263
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:44,370
No one carries new mufflers
for an Eight-Five anymore.

264
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,770
Nobody!

265
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,210
I'm crying!

266
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,880
I never thought anyone would be
driving an Eight-Five in this day and age!

267
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,040
It suits you well though, kid!

268
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,910
--Let's go.
--Thanks for the laugh, kid.

269
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,440
Don't let any scooters tailgate you!

270
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,950
That's it! They're gonna pay!

271
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,020
Itsuki, do you mind if I drive your car?!

272
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,350
But, Takumi!

273
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,880
Go to the passenger side. Hurry!

274
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,360
What are you gonna do, chase them?

275
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,060
This is only an Eight-Five with
loose suspension and '70s tires.

276
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,460
It doesn't matter!

277
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,370
We don't have to do this, Takumi!

278
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,970
It doesn't have LSD, either!

279
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,230
Shut up and put on your seat belt!

280
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,140
It may get rough,

281
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,610
but just trust me, okay?

282
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:02,180
I promise I won't crash your precious car.

283
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,910
Here we go!

284
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,530
Takumi! Ohh! Ohhh!

285
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,830
P... Please...

286
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:19,430
Take good care of my Eight-Five!
