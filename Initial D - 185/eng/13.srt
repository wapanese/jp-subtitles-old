<i>And go straight to our reason for living</i>

<i>That's our law!</i>

31
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,090
That punk!

32
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,360
Hey, you!

33
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,530
I know you're the one who
hit me from behind yesterday.

34
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,430
Are you kidding me?

35
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,040
--That was your fault.
--What?

36
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,870
Your car was going so slow
that I couldn't anticipate it.

37
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,480
I never thought you could
attack a corner that slowly.

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,880
I tried to brake, but... bump.

39
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,320
What did you say?!

40
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,690
Calm down, Iketani!

41
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,520
If you insist, then we'll race under my rules.

42
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,660
If I lose, I'll be on the ground
begging for your forgiveness.

43
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,060
What do you mean, "your" rules?

44
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,900
It's nothing.

45
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,040
We call it the "duct tape death match."

46
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,570
Duct tape death match?

47
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:28,510
I hear the Speed Stars' Eight-Six
is a downhill specialist.

48
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,350
Tell this Eight-Six kid

49
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,220
that I'll be waiting here
next Saturday at 10 p.m.

50
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,580
I'll see you then.

51
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,310
I think that punk just challenged you, Takumi.

52
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,240
He didn't recognize your face, though.

53
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,010
Go for it, Takumi!

54
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,210
Duct tape or whatever...

55
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,150
Beat that jerk badly and
make him beg for forgiveness!

56
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,980
It sounds too risky, Itsuki.

57
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,020
He can't steer in this race.

58
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,690
But, Iketani...

59
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,360
Takumi beat the FD and the R32.

60
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,360
His little rule won't make any difference.

61
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,030
I'm sure he's been practicing a lot this way.

62
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,530
Takumi, it's too risky.

63
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,660
Don't take the bait.

64
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,040
I have no desire to, really...

65
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,170
Good for you. Just ignore him.

66
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:44,720
"Act 13: First Date"

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,340
What? A duct tape death match?

68
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,510
--Yeah.
--That's reckless.

69
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,910
Is Takumi...?

70
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,880
As usual, he's calm and unexcited.

71
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,820
He's not into it at all.

72
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,350
I want him to do it!

73
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,020
It would be so refreshing to beat that jerk

74
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,320
and make him apologize!

75
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,020
He drives a Civic, the rival
of the Levin and the Trueno.

76
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:35,540
In my day, we raced in a variety
of ways under different rules,

77
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,380
but the duct tape death match was
one of the most dangerous ones.

78
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,850
Is it really that dangerous?

79
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,910
It doesn't sound like it.

80
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,280
Itsuki, get in your car and try it for yourself,

81
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,280
then you'll understand.

82
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,360
--Well...
--Okay.

83
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,190
Don't let go of your right hand,

84
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,860
and steer all the way to either side.

85
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,390
Sure.

86
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,070
This is as far as it goes!

87
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,310
Leave the wheel there and come out.

88
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,870
Okay.

89
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,880
See how much you steered.

90
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,350
Sure.

91
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,820
What?! This is it?!

92
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,480
I steered as far as I could.

93
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,690
See?

94
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,520
How can you turn corners like this?

95
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,890
Let alone drive the pass...

96
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,660
Steering can only be used to initiate the turn.

97
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,360
You have to turn by sliding the rear tires.

98
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,870
--All the corners.
--What?!

99
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,040
But Takumi is a drift expert, so he can manage.

100
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,040
It's not that easy.

101
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,710
You can't counter,

102
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,010
which makes it harder to control the drift.

103
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,410
Oversteering means a spin,

104
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:57,090
but if you go "under" into
a turn, that'll be the end.

105
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,890
This rule definitely favors an FF driver.

106
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,960
--He drives an EG6, right?
--Yes.

107
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,030
Its accelerator eliminates oversteering,

108
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,500
so he can attack corners at full speed.

109
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,800
Its side brake also eliminates "under."

110
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,800
But an FR such as the Eight-Six
needs to continuously drift

111
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,740
through a narrow area as if
walking on a tightrope...

112
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,640
It's better to avoid it.

113
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,650
<i>Darn...</i>

114
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,590
<i>Talk like this may trigger his interest.</i>

115
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,850
Uh, boss?

116
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,980
--Isn't that Kenji?
--Oh...

117
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,560
Iketani...

118
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,100
I did a little research on
that punk from the other day.

119
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,670
He's Shingo Shoji of the Myogi Night Kids.

120
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,840
Shingo Shoji of the Night Kids...

121
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,110
He's their number two,

122
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,840
but he's confident enough to call himself

123
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,110
the fastest downhill racer of the Night Kids.

124
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,550
He'll stop at nothing to reach his goals,

125
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,290
so he isn't popular with his teammates,

126
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:09,060
especially their leader, Nakazato.

127
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,960
I see. That's why he's challenging Takumi.

128
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,160
So that he can take over the Night Kids.

129
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,900
He's been spreading a
rumor about this already.

130
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,400
A rumor?

131
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,470
A rumor that the Speed Stars are scared

132
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,970
and avoiding Shingo's challenge.

133
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,810
And he mentions nothing about duct tape.

134
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,340
He's making us look bad.

135
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,880
What a jerk!

136
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,420
He's trying to drag Takumi
into the race no matter what.

137
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,750
Oh!

138
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,550
Takumi...

139
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:46,990
I have no interest in racing him at all, really.

140
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,360
That's good.

141
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,840
You don't have to accept all the
challenges that come your way.

142
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,740
--Forget about it.
--Yeah...

143
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:05,110
Whatever happened to
the race with the Eight-Six?

144
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,110
I'm all ready to go.

145
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,480
It's up to him now.

146
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,150
Don't worry...

147
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,790
I'll drag him out, no matter what.

148
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:18,690
Looks like it'll be an interesting race.

149
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,860
Takeshi!

150
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,800
Shingo, I hear you're
planning something big...

151
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,630
Do what you want,

152
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:30,870
but don't do anything to insult
the name of the Night Kids.

153
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,010
What's so funny?

154
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,010
Isn't it you who has insulted our name?

155
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,550
What?

156
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,990
I wonder who lost to that obsolete Eight-Six...

157
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,320
...with a powerful R32?

158
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,990
Shingo...

159
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:53,860
A loser should be off sulking somewhere.

160
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,700
Still acting like a leader
and giving me a lecture...

161
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,330
You make me laugh.

162
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,770
I'll avenge you, Nakazato.

163
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,040
Be thankful.

164
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,320
<i>Shingo, someday you'll find out...</i>

165
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,940
<i>...how fierce that Eight-Six is.</i>

166
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,490
Well, Takeshi is on the skids.

167
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,790
He's pitiful, really.

168
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,730
Shingo, you're the new
leader of the Night Kids.

169
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,870
First, I have to send the Eight-Six
of Mount Akina to the scrap yard.

170
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,860
Hello! This is Takeuchi...

171
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,430
Is this Saori?

172
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,860
Itsuki?

173
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,670
Of course, I remember you.

174
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,900
Yeah. A drive to Akina Lake?

175
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,340
Okay.

176
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,510
Really?!

177
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,610
I'll meet you at that bus stop at 1:00, then.

178
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,580
Yeah, bye!

179
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:30,760
Yeah! I just put an end to years of no girlfriend!

180
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,890
I'll make it count!

181
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,440
Here you go.

182
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,750
Hey, Dad...

183
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,620
What is it?

184
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,990
Is a duct tape death match...?

185
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,510
No, never mind.

186
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,990
<i>A duct tape death match...</i>

187
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,420
Takumi...

188
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,750
You're good at driving cars.

189
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:42,930
Takumi, I wouldn't mind going with you...

190
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,570
...on an overnight trip.

191
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:50,300
<i>I'm very conscious of her lately...</i>

192
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,650
Thank you very much!

193
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,830
Where is Itsuki?

194
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,570
He was just washing his car...

195
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,730
Where did he go?

196
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,340
"Practice Guide"

197
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,010
I see, I see...

198
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,710
Is this where you were hiding?

199
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,380
Um, I, uh, was just resting...

200
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,890
It's rare to see you with a book.

201
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,550
That's just, uh...!

202
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,260
Let's see: "Love Manual:
How to Impress Your Date"!

203
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,090
That book is just...

204
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:52,030
The reason you're reading
this book is because...

205
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,470
...you have a date?

206
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,230
Yes!

207
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,810
Is it with that Saori girl you mentioned before?

208
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,810
What about me?!

209
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,510
I picked it up at a bookstore yesterday

210
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,010
and have been studying it.

211
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,580
You seem to have very little
advice on things like this.

212
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,680
That hurts, though you're
probably right about that.

213
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,430
Things are easier nowadays.

214
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,930
In my day, we had to feel our way through...

215
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:27,570
Let me see: "You should
have her by the third date.

216
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:31,670
Create a romantic setting for your first kiss..."

217
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,010
I got that covered, boss!

218
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,540
So, like I mentioned before,

219
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,110
I would like to take a day off.

220
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,550
That's why... Sure.

221
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,210
I envy you, you little...

222
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,640
<i>I look cool!</i>

223
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,910
<i>I wonder where she is...?</i>

224
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,510
I'm here, Itsuki!

225
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,230
I'm so happy!

226
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,870
Welcome--

227
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,920
I don't need gas.

228
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,290
I came to get the answer to my invitation.

229
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,120
You did tell him, didn't you?

230
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,060
Yeah. He said he had no interest in it.

231
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,060
That's a laugh.

232
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,330
I didn't know that the Eight-Six was a chicken.

233
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:10,540
He can't be scared of a
duct tape death match, can he?

234
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,840
That's all right. I'll make him want to do it.

235
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,770
<i>So cute!</i>

236
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,990
"Ropeway Depot"

237
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,870
We street racers don't talk
about "turning" a corner.

238
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,340
We "attack" it.

239
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,270
Maybe I should get a license.

240
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:57,780
Why not? I'll teach you how to drive.

241
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,210
I'll think about it.

242
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,220
Oh, wow, Mount Fuji of Akina!

243
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,480
It's so beautiful!

244
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,790
<i>Well, girls are suckers for romance...</i>

245
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:15,020
<i>The first kiss should be at a romantic setting...</i>

246
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,200
<i>The first kiss...</i>

247
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,700
<i>Now is perfect. Go for it, Itsuki!</i>

248
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,050
Wha...?!

249
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,690
Itsuki?!

250
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,450
Sorry...

251
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,040
Yeah...

252
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,800
<i>An awkward silence... What should I do?</i>

253
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,680
<i>I found you.</i>

254
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,370
<i>An EG6? He bumped me.</i>

255
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,860
<i>Am I going too slowly for him?</i>

256
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,180
<i>He's on my tail.</i>

257
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:18,050
<i>Darn, I can't look bad in front of Saori!</i>

258
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,450
Saori...

259
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,160
I gotta speed up.

260
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,850
Hang on for a bit!

261
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,400
Stop, Itsuki!

262
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,900
This is a street race!

263
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,540
I can't stop now!

264
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,520
<i>I have to protect Saori...</i>

265
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,140
Listen up, Itsuki got in an accident!

266
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,770
--What?
--Where?

267
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,240
Akina Pass.

268
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,080
They're at the city hospital.

269
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,880
Can you head over there now?

270
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,480
Sure.

271
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:55,570
"City Hospital"

272
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,720
Are you okay, Itsuki?

273
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,550
Iketani, Takumi!

274
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,320
So, what happened?

275
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,190
It's nothing. It's not as bad as it looks, really.

276
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:10,430
They're keeping me here to
do some tests, just in case.

277
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,170
Weren't you with Saori?

278
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:16,670
She only had a few scratches,
so she went home.

279
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,840
I steered my best to
protect the passenger side.

280
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,110
What happened to your Eight-Five?

281
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:27,380
I spun it well, so only the
trunk area was damaged.

282
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,280
Okay, you're done.

283
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,740
--Take care.
--Thank you very much.

284
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,730
I was going down the pass

285
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,960
when an EG6 started tailgating me.

286
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,900
An EG6? Was it him?

287
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,740
Maybe. It was a red EG6.

288
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,910
He pushed me from behind at a corner...

289
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:57,380
That punk did it again!

290
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,050
Darn...

291
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,380
I'll do it.

292
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,420
Duct tape or whatever,
I'll accept the challenge!

293
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,150
Takumi, wait up!

294
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,890
Takumi?!

295
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,090
Oh, I'm sorry.

296
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:15,560
Don't let him drag you into it.
This whole thing is ridiculous!

297
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,200
Don't do it, Takumi!

298
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,220
I won't lose, no matter what.

299
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,460
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

300
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,530
<i>So no one intervenes</i>

301
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,060
<i>Never stop, I don't want to stop</i>

302
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,130
<i>Even if you cry because of a sacrificed love</i>

303
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,930
<i>Aim for the peak, sweep the winding street</i>

304
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,140
<i>Beep beep! The warning chime is so cheap!</i>

305
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,600
<i>The sheep should clear the road</i>

306
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,040
<i>'Cuz I'm never gonna stop, streak my dream</i>

307
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,910
<i>Easy motivation is total stimulation</i>

308
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,980
<i>You tried to escape,</i>
<i>but anywhere is a safety zone</i>

309
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,990
<i>Something is within your grasp</i>
<i>and something is forgotten</i>

310
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,920
<i>Even if the world ends it will never change</i>

311
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:24,000
<i>Beasty shout, no one can touch you</i>

312
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,370
<i>Cross over now to the time of an intense dream</i>

313
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,410
<i>Rage your dream, split the darkness</i>

314
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,380
<i>Like a streak to the peak</i>

315
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:43,520
<i>Erase the freezing darkness worldwide</i>

316
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,390
<i>Rage your dream, and open the road</i>

317
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,060
<i>Di-ding down, another round never slow down</i>

318
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,060
<i>A point 01 second knockdown</i>

319
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,260
<i>Reverberations left behind,</i>
<i>disappear to the next town</i>

320
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,100
<i>The losers are left in the dust</i>

321
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,060
<i>Let's ignore the constraints of logic</i>

322
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,030
<i>'Cause they're a pain</i>

323
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,170
<i>A streaker runs naked across the street</i>

324
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,370
<i>Something they would know</i>

325
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,410
<i>Rage your dream,</i>
<i>continue on the unending road</i>

326
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,410
<i>Don't look back on your love or your past</i>

327
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:15,480
<i>Go forward and you'll shine brightly</i>

328
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,550
<i>Rage your dream, you're living in the now</i>

329
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,600
<i>Wasn't it wrong to involve Itsuki</i>

330
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,100
<i>and make him spin out like that, Shingo?</i>

331
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,000
<i>It's okay, as long as I can drag out the Eight-Six.</i>

332
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,400
<i>But...</i>

333
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:40,170
<i>Since I know for sure that I'll</i>
<i>beat him with the duct tape rule,</i>

334
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,510
<i>just winning isn't enough fun.</i>

335
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:45,010
<i>I'll give you a flashy show.</i>

336
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:49,850
<i>Next on Initial D, "Evolving Drift!"</i>

337
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:53,950
<i>I'll make sure he can taste</i>
<i>the fear of the downhill.</i>

338
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,890
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
