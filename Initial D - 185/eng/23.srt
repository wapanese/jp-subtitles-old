00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,920
<i>And just love you</i>

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,320
<i>Then I know I could face the truth</i>

23
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,000
Takumi, you don't look too sharp.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,500
Are you sure you'll be okay in the rain?

25
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,000
Who knows?

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,840
I can't go too fast in the rain,
so I'll drive normally.

27
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,340
Who knows if I'll be fast or slow?

28
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,610
I'll take it easy,

29
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,110
'cause if I crashed, my dad would kill me.

30
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,890
I'll count down!

31
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,890
Five... Four...

32
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,060
Three... Two...

33
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,530
One... Go!

"Act 23: The Rainy Downhill"

35
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,380
The S14 got off to a faster start.

36
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,410
It's not a turbo, but it has a two-liter engine.

37
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,050
It's not just the size of the engine.

38
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,050
He used the clutch well on the wet surface.

39
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,190
No wonder he's confident.

40
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,260
That wasn't the Eight-Six's best start.

41
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,490
He knows he can catch up once he gets going.

42
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,330
<i>He took the lead!</i>

43
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,440
<i>Oh, no! His powerful S14 will widen the gap,</i>

44
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,730
<i>and we'll be left behind!</i>

45
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,620
He's way behind.

46
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,050
This hill is too much for an Eight-Six.

47
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,260
But it's downhill from here to the finish line.

48
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,360
That Eight-Six is known for
his killer downhill technique,

49
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,600
"Sekimon Entrance"

50
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,790
so he'll make a comeback.

51
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,220
Hello?

52
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,250
Hey, big brother.

53
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,490
The Eight-Six and Kenta in the rain?

54
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,330
Yeah.

55
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,900
Kenta is very confident
racing against the Eight-Six,

56
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,830
but I know it won't be that easy.

57
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,470
I agree. Drifting through corners at low speed

58
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,340
is completely different from an actual race.

59
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,250
Yeah. It gets very difficult when
you have to floor the gas pedal.

60
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,750
What tire grip can
compensate for on a dry surface

61
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,920
is severely limited in the rain.

62
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,430
You have to shift the weight properly,

63
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,930
or you'll lose control and crash in no time.

64
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,800
I wonder if those two really understand

65
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,540
the difficulty of a rainy race?

66
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,370
Interesting...

67
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,210
"Those two..."

68
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,980
You liar!

69
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,640
You're only interested in the Eight-Six.

70
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,680
Help! I'm not ready to die!

71
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,090
Darn... it's coming down harder now.

72
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,420
The opponent is from Akagi,

73
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,660
so neither one has the advantage here.

74
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,590
The problem is the rain.

75
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,660
I wonder if he can perform in the rain?

76
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,570
I'm sure he can,

77
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,240
because he makes deliveries every day.

78
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,350
I'm sure he's driven on rainy days.

79
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,750
Of course he has!

80
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,920
Then his technique

81
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,510
should be effective in the rain, too.

82
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,730
<i>I won't let you catch up!</i>

83
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,400
<i>I'll widen the gap.</i>

84
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,770
<i>In the rain, I can even</i>
<i>outrace turbo-charged cars.</i>

85
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,700
He swung his tail!

86
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,260
The S14 is running well in the rain.

87
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,330
It's hard to control an FR in the rain.

88
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,230
Yeah. It only spins to the side, not forward.

89
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,970
It's the Eight-Six!

90
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,520
Unbelievable!

91
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,990
What a drift in the rain!

92
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,470
What was that?

93
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,630
That drift was scary.

94
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:22,160
I have goose bumps.

95
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,710
<i>Is this the same person</i>
<i>who was lost in a daydream?</i>

96
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:37,190
<i>He said he would take it easy...</i>

97
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,990
<i>So is this how he normally drives?!</i>

98
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,330
<i>Besides, it's impossible to see in this rain.</i>

99
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,190
<i>How does he do it?</i>

100
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,060
<i>It's so dark that I can't even see the road!</i>

101
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,240
<i>Stop that ringing!</i>

102
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,680
<i>This speed is insane!</i>

103
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,230
<i>He's not human.</i>

104
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,060
<i>He's a monster!</i>

105
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,850
<i>I'm on!</i>

106
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,530
<i>I'm in top form tonight!</i>

107
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,060
<i>I'll put an end to the</i>
<i>Eight-Six's undefeated streak!</i>

108
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,730
<i>It's not Keisuke or Ryosuke,</i>

109
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,220
<i>but me who will defeat him!</i>

110
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,230
<i>What?!</i>

111
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,950
<i>The Eight-Six is on my tail.</i>

112
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,450
<i>How? It can't be!</i>

113
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,720
<i>What's happening?</i>

114
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,160
<i>We haven't gone through</i>
<i>that many downhill corners yet.</i>

115
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,830
<i>This isn't happening!</i>

116
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:31,170
<i>I got caught so easily...</i>

117
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,290
<i>...going downhill in the rain.</i>

118
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,770
But...

119
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,970
...it's not over yet!

120
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,670
They're only inches apart!

121
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,390
Look! The Eight-Six is cutting in!

122
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,550
The Eight-Six is passing him!

123
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,040
He made it look easy.

124
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,880
Are you kidding?

125
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,550
It was worth waiting in the rain.

126
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,110
Yeah.

127
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,190
<i>I can't keep up!</i>

128
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,620
<i>The gap widens with each corner!</i>

129
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,030
<i>I can't go around the corners as fast.</i>

130
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,370
<i>What could be making the difference?</i>

131
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,560
<i>I thought the rain was on my side!</i>

132
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,820
Right, I see.

133
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,830
Word from the mid-point.

134
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,170
The Eight-Six passed your guy.

135
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:22,340
I guess he was way out of Kenta's league.

136
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:26,410
He did well, though.

137
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,780
The Eight-Six is even fast in the rain.

138
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,080
It was obvious even before the race.

139
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,110
The weather plays no part
in defeating the Eight-Six.

140
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,160
It's finally your brother's turn.

141
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,820
--Welcome!
--Welcome!

142
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,460
Welcome.

143
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,800
Anyway...

144
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,700
...we now know that he can
race just as well in the rain.

145
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,200
He's becoming more like
a true racer every day.

146
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,010
He willingly took the S14's
challenge last night.

147
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:36,180
His daydreaming seems to have passed.

148
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,810
I think our operation was a big success.

149
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,480
Yeah.

150
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,890
Anyhow, Itsuki, you were lucky

151
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:51,530
to be able to experience
that rainy downhill battle.

152
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:56,530
It was so scary that I
thought I would die for sure!

153
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:00,490
Besides, he told me to sit in the back instead.

154
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,400
In the back?

155
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,670
--Why?
--No idea.

156
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:11,410
I don't even think Takumi
knew the reason for it.

157
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,020
I get it.

158
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,020
I think I understand the reason.

159
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,350
Really?

160
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,560
What is it?

161
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,250
It's because...

162
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,700
--Well...
--Well?

163
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,600
Itsuki's annoying.

164
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:38,240
It must be hard to focus when
Itsuki's screaming next to you.

165
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,740
That makes sense.

166
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,230
That's why!

167
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:48,080
<i>That's not it at all, you boneheads.</i>

168
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,080
<i>He had Itsuki in the back</i>

169
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,790
<i>because he thought he</i>
<i>could get extra tire traction.</i>

170
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:59,730
<i>I bet he knew that intuitively.</i>

171
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,330
Thank you very much.

172
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:06,000
<i>I have no idea how much better he'll get.</i>

173
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,800
Takumi!

174
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,080
Who is she?

175
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,410
Is that...?

176
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:20,900
--His girlfriend.
--What?!

177
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,420
"Card Club Pricing"

178
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:35,160
I don't know why I came,
but I just ended up here.

179
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,700
Yeah?

180
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,600
--Is this a bad time?
--No.

181
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,510
He looks obsessed!

182
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,600
This isn't good.

183
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,380
"Card Club Pricing"

184
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,720
I hate to bother you at work, so I'll go.

185
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,320
Yeah.

186
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,020
Trouble!

187
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,520
He may start daydreaming about her again!

188
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,020
Do something, Itsuki.

189
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:38,160
There aren't any more races for him to see!

190
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,860
There's no time for him to daydream

191
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,030
before the big race next week.

192
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,900
I know that!

193
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,840
Hey, Takumi!

194
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,860
Let's go to Akina for a spin tonight!

195
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,220
It looks dirty.

196
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,120
I guess it's because of last night.

197
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,350
Hello?

198
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,520
Who is this?

199
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,660
It's me. It's been a while, Bunta.

200
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,790
Oh, it's you.

201
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,290
What's the occasion?

202
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,460
Did you crash and get hospitalized?

203
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,300
You wish.

204
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,130
By the way...

205
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,800
...I hear people are talking about your son.

206
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,600
I hear he's good.

207
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,480
What? This Saturday?

208
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,310
Against Ryosuke Takahashi? Who is that?

209
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,980
You don't know him?

210
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,550
Even my people know who he is.

211
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:48,060
I hear he's the best street racer in Gunma.

212
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:52,030
My son and he are racing, huh?

213
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,030
Who do you think will win?

214
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:59,560
Who knows? We'll find out this Saturday.

215
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,500
You haven't changed a bit.

216
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,640
I'm curious about the drift
your son learned from you.

217
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,550
You scarred me for life
with your monstrous drift.

218
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,050
That was years ago.

219
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:24,020
--Mr. Tsuchiya, we need you.
--Yeah.

220
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,020
Later, Bunta.

221
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:17,710
I can tell that you've improved a lot, Itsuki.

222
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,810
You really think so?

223
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:24,480
That means a lot coming from you, Takumi!

224
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,250
I've been practicing the "grip run," you know?

225
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,430
Just for you, here's a
brilliant technique of mine

226
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:37,760
that resulted from hours of practice.

227
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,560
"Illusionary Hell and Tear!"

228
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,740
This is strange!

229
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,510
I had no problem with it yesterday.

230
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,950
The next corner, then!

231
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,850
"Incredible Braking!"

232
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,950
Hold on, Itsuki!

233
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,370
I can relax now.

234
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,670
I was worried you were
daydreaming about girls again.

235
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,310
Girls? What do you mean by that?!

236
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,310
I wasn't doing that!

237
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:23,880
But you were acting so weird.

238
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,220
I told you that I was thinking...

239
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,050
...about what would
happen after this big race,

240
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:36,390
regardless of the outcome.

241
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:39,230
Don't you get what I'm saying?

242
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,630
No idea.

243
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,460
It's all a riddle to me.

244
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,030
Why do you need anything after the race?

245
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,540
You don't need anything.

246
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,510
You're already fast as it is.

247
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,170
I'm not fast.

248
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,680
Yes, you are!

249
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,680
You have an undefeated streak going.

250
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,350
I don't know.

251
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:08,060
I just don't know where I'm headed.

252
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,560
Can't you just focus on the big race for now?

253
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,390
You don't have much time left.

254
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,030
Ryosuke Takahashi...

255
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:40,350
<i>There was a time when I</i>
<i>wandered aimlessly, tired of love</i>

256
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:48,200
<i>I lost sight of myself and gave in to desire</i>

257
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,600
<i>But destiny is ever-changing</i>

258
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:02,240
<i>And charmed by innocent eyes</i>

259
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:10,150
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I hold you ever so tightly</i>

260
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:16,960
<i>All I can say is that I believe</i>
<i>my feelings are true</i>

261
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,130
<i>Let's enjoy our happiness...</i>

262
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:29,230
<i>Into our shining future</i>

263
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:48,860
<i>We'll prove countless times...</i>

264
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:54,930
<i>Our passion will last for eternity!</i>

265
00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:01,600
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I embrace you ever so tightly</i>

266
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:08,440
<i>Even if I lose everything that I have,</i>
<i>I will never let you go</i>

267
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,680
<i>Bloom, my beautiful...</i>

268
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:20,050
<i>...and miraculous flower</i>

269
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:30,530
<i>It's the moment of truth for your</i>
<i>"fastest racer" theory, Ryosuke.</i>

270
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:33,570
<i>I'm looking forward to the opportunity.</i>

271
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,340
<i>So, what exactly is your theory?</i>

272
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,470
<i>2</i>
<i>I'm sure you're familiar with E = mc.</i>

273
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:43,980
<i>It's Einstein's Theory of Relativity.</i>

274
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,910
<i>I've added my own sub-theories to it.</i>

275
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:50,420
<i>"E" symbolizes the opponent's</i>
<i>average speed and...</i>

276
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,390
<i>Next on Initial D: "Akagi's White Comet!"</i>

277
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,080
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
