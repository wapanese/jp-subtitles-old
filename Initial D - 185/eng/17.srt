<i>And go straight to our reason for living</i>

<i>That's our law!</i>

31
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,090
Please, Takumi!

32
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,800
I couldn't tell this to the others,

33
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,830
but I knew I had to tell you
to make you understand.

34
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,310
I don't like this. She makes me mad.

35
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,140
Takumi, don't be angry at Mako.

36
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,180
She's a good girl.

37
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,180
I don't know why you have to defend her.

38
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,120
I don't get it. You don't owe her anything.

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,650
I'm begging you, Takumi.

40
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,200
<i>Hey, Takumi?</i>

41
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,040
<i>You've never been to other passes, have you?</i>

42
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,540
<i>Could you race here?</i>

43
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,030
<i>I wouldn't know until I tried it.</i>

44
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,490
I'll race her.

45
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,260
Really? I'd be so grateful!

46
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,730
I don't know what you and that
girl expect out of this, but...

47
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,330
Takumi...

48
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,770
I'll go to Usui with my Eight-Six.

49
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:03,670
"Act 17: Sudden-Death Death Match"

50
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,850
Are you serious, Kenji?!

51
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,290
I can't believe Takumi decided to battle it out

52
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,450
with Usui's Sileighty!

53
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,460
Me, neither.

54
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:20,030
It's not like him to go to
another pass and battle it out.

55
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,900
How did Iketani talk him into it?

56
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,700
I'm not really sure.

57
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,210
Iketani doesn't want to talk about it in detail.

58
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,140
We talked about what would happen

59
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,440
if Takumi raced at another pass, remember?

60
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,910
Yeah.

61
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,920
I can kind of understand Iketani
wanting to see that happen...

62
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,910
But he doesn't have to race
the Sileighty right off the bat.

63
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,990
Is Takumi racing in Usui?

64
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,790
That's right, boss!

65
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,230
And the Sileighty is that good, huh?

66
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,800
She's better than good!

67
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:04,140
She drifted left and right, and faked
some moves on that narrow road!

68
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,810
Takumi was there, too,

69
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,310
so he knows how good she is.

70
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,310
He'll win, though!

71
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,480
I almost envy your simplicity.

72
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,820
That attendant said that
no local had ever beaten her.

73
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,660
Maybe this time,

74
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,650
it's not about winning or losing for Takumi.

75
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,140
I'm out of cigarettes.

76
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,440
I guess I'll go for a little spin.

77
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,480
What the...?!

78
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,890
My Eight-Six turned into an Eight-Five.

79
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,690
"I borrowed the car.

80
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,690
I left you a replacement.

81
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,690
- Takumi"

82
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,240
Your dad must be freaking right about now!

83
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,000
His Eight-Six turned into my Eight-Five.

84
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,810
Iketani, I want to ask you something.

85
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,150
What?

86
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,890
Which side are you on this time?

87
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,090
Which side?

88
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,830
I just coordinated this race, that's all.

89
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,390
Am I supposed to believe that?

90
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,500
What about Takumi?

91
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,170
Aren't you sacrificing your friend

92
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,540
to look good in front of Mako?

93
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,910
--That's not true.
--Oh, yeah?

94
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:51,350
Then do you really think
Takumi can win this race?

95
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,210
Do you? What's your answer?!

96
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,620
I, uh...

97
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,060
He has no chance.

98
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,300
He only knows Akina Pass, and is racing

99
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,400
at difficult Usui Pass for the first time.

100
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,070
I know his technique is incredible,

101
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:22,410
but that's not the answer to everything, is it?

102
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,410
He's never even driven the pass!

103
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:31,120
Even Takumi can't handle a new
course without any practice.

104
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,760
You must've realized that much.

105
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,630
I, uh...

106
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,000
Men go crazy for women they like.

107
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
To make this summer memorable,

108
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,170
I would like to race
Akina's Eight-Six at Usui Pass.

109
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:57,680
But don't sell out your friend for a woman!

110
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,350
Have you forgotten that Takumi and
his Eight-Six saved your ass once?

111
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,450
The Eight-Six of Mount Akina is our pride.

112
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:11,360
Let's stop this nonsense...

113
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,350
...or our friendship is over!

114
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,370
You're right, Kenji.

115
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,220
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,660
I should've come to you
with this a long time ago,

117
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,990
but I kept it to myself.

118
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,690
I still don't get why you're quitting racing.

119
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:57,540
It was so much fun when we
started racing two years ago.

120
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,480
We've always wanted to
become the fastest here.

121
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,520
It's still fun, though, isn't it?

122
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,050
I can't explain it...

123
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,020
...but I'm just not as intense as before.

124
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,190
I don't know why.

125
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:21,600
I just feel like it's time to move on.

126
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,740
I've done enough...

127
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,570
I don't know.

128
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,740
I still don't get it.

129
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,010
I want to have a boyfriend

130
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,620
and a normal relationship, like you do.

131
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,050
You can race and still have a boyfriend.

132
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,550
You can't.

133
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,890
I don't think you can understand how I feel.

134
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,730
You have someone you like, don't you?

135
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:18,390
I must confess that I've
had someone in mind...

136
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,590
I was just messing with you. I didn't know.

137
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,760
You couldn't have known.

138
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,900
He's not from here,

139
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,470
and I was just admiring him from afar.

140
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,300
Oh, my!

141
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,010
You must be the ultimate innocent, shy girl.

142
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,470
And you're 20.

143
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,140
I liked it that way.

144
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,580
I was satisfied with just admiring him.

145
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:50,120
You gotta learn to be more realistic than that.

146
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,820
Sorry.

147
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:57,830
But I do want to test what you and I
have built in the last two years...

148
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,160
...in this final race.

149
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,530
You want a final exam.

150
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,500
It sounds good to me.

151
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,370
He's a perfect opponent for you.

152
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,100
Yeah.

153
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,210
But I'll tell you this...

154
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,040
As long as we race at Usui Pass,

155
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,780
we have to win, no matter who we race.

156
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,850
I can't accept anything less.

157
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,990
I know.

158
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,460
We have to win, no matter what.

159
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,030
Even if it's against the Eight-Six.

160
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,120
Absolutely.

161
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:43,400
Well, there's no use racing if you're not into it.

162
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,640
Iketani and I will let them know.

163
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,200
You guys turn around here.

164
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,880
Yeah, I'm sorry, Takumi.

165
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,150
He means it, Takumi.

166
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:01,490
Kenji, I'm not going back.

167
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,520
Takumi...

168
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,030
I'm going because...

169
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,360
...I do want to race her.

170
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,570
I'm not going back.

171
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,260
Takumi...

172
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:19,240
But Takumi, you saw what Mako is capable of.

173
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,380
She's too much for you.

174
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,410
--Even you can't beat her.
--I know.

175
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,380
This isn't about winning or losing.

176
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,390
Don't say that!

177
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,060
The Eight-Six of Mount Akina is famous now!

178
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,790
Have some pride.

179
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,190
I'm not good at that sort of thing.

180
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,960
I happened to win some local races,

181
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,260
and the rumors exaggerated my abilities.

182
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,140
I would feel better if
rumors like that went away.

183
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,610
--Hey...
--Come on!

184
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,810
I'm going.

185
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:02,110
I just want to attack this
new pass as well as I can.

186
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,220
I should apologize for my harsh words earlier.

187
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,300
How could we say anything
to him after that, really?

188
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,160
Yeah.

189
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,400
Well, he's one of a kind for sure.

190
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,640
He's strange.

191
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,910
It's hard to tell if he's special...

192
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,140
...or simply "off."

193
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,790
The tires look good.

194
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,630
The pressure is ideal for this road.

195
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,470
I don't think it's necessary
to make any more adjustments.

196
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,940
If you say so, Sayuki.

197
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,710
I know you know,

198
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:02,140
but in this kind of race,
avoid wide-angle drifts.

199
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,980
And it's crucial to know when
to drift and when not to drift,

200
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:11,150
especially with Usui's continuous turns.

201
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:15,320
I'm with you, so believe in
your technique and go for it.

202
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,810
You won't lose to anyone!

203
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,660
I won't let you down.

204
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,170
Together, we're one winning team.

205
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,200
--Yeah.
--I'm fired up, Sayuki!

206
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,140
I've never felt this good before.

207
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,810
<i>I'm excited to see how the race will turn out...</i>

208
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,210
<i>...and how good he really is.</i>

209
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,740
So, how are you gonna win this race, Takumi?

210
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,410
Do you have a plan? Tell me!

211
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,110
Not really.

212
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,680
What?!

213
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,510
Can't you think of something?

214
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,710
I refuse to see you lose.

215
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,690
How about this?

216
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,360
Usui Pass is narrow
and has no straight lines...

217
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,630
...so jump the gun and get ahead!

218
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,870
What the...?

219
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:39,040
And you can block her the rest
of the way to the finish line!

220
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,040
I can't do that, 'cuz it's unfair.

221
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,210
But if she gets ahead of you, it's over.

222
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,380
That's true...

223
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,160
Man, we need to come up with a plan!

224
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,890
Her car has four wheels just like yours...

225
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,230
What?!

226
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:19,180
Are you really the driver of
the Eight-Six of Mount Akina?

227
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,150
Unbelievable.

228
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,920
How old are you, anyway?

229
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,920
I'm eighteen.

230
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,090
Eighteen? A high school kid?
You've gotta be kidding me...

231
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:32,090
Twenty isn't much older than eighteen.

232
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,830
And they're girls.

233
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:38,990
Now we really can't lose to him, right, Mako?

234
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,440
Let's talk about the race.

235
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,890
I don't think it's a good idea
to start side by side here,

236
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,390
because whoever has a better start

237
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:07,230
has a definite advantage.

238
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:11,300
I'd hate to argue over who
cheated and jumped the gun.

239
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,900
There goes my plan!

240
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,070
Then how?

241
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,210
How about a "cat and mouse" race?

242
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,410
It's a chase race.

243
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,910
If the mouse gets away, it's over.

244
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:27,580
If not, we keep switching
positions until someone wins.

245
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,920
It's a "sudden-death death match."

246
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,990
--Well?
--That's fine.

247
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,760
Since we're the locals here,

248
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:40,190
you get to choose whether you
want to be the cat or the mouse.

249
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,430
--Well...
--Hold on a sec!

250
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,400
Come here, Takumi.

251
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,740
With this rule, you should go in front first.

252
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,070
It won't end with one race,

253
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,240
but at least you get one practice.

254
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,180
It's better to lose in the second race.

255
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,380
He'll go in front first.

256
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,290
I'll win in the second race, then.

257
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:10,460
I don't mean to ignore your good advice,

258
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,130
but I don't think I like that.

259
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,930
What are you saying, Takumi?!

260
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,870
--I'll chase her first.
--What?!

261
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,440
--Wha...?!
--Think it over, Takumi!

262
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,440
This is my race, so let me decide.

263
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,600
But...!

264
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,550
--I'll chase.
--What?

265
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,150
You'll chase?

266
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,280
Is he trying to insult us, or is he an idiot?

267
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,720
It's okay. I'll smoke him!

268
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,500
Who is it? I'm busy.

269
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,580
Fujiwara Tofu Shop.

270
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,080
Hey, Bunta?

271
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,920
It's only you.

272
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,180
I'm busy right now.

273
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:14,820
I thought I should tell you
something about Takumi...

274
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,860
Should we start the race?

275
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,260
He went to Usui for a race? So?

276
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,930
"So?" Is that all you can say?

277
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,870
Aren't you worried?

278
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:31,110
Not really. He's my son, you know?

279
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,840
We'll go slowly, so just follow us.

280
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,150
After the first turn, we'll go full speed.

281
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,620
That's the beginning of the race.

282
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,000
Is that all you have to say?

283
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,540
That's all.

284
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:09,030
I'm busy, so don't call me about nonsense.

285
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,170
Hey, Bunta?!

286
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,050
I was an idiot, Takumi.

287
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,220
I realize that now.

288
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,390
I know...

289
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:28,530
...that the only reason you
agreed to try this losing race

290
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,930
was to save my ego.

291
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:34,600
I'm regretting it now.

292
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,770
You're Akina's racer.

293
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,210
You're our pride.

294
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,110
This is a huge mistake.

295
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:52,850
I don't wanna see you lose
because of my stupidity.

296
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,260
He won't lose, Iketani!

297
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,450
Reality isn't that simple, you know.

298
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,130
It's my fault.

299
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,890
Iketani...

300
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,070
Iketani...

301
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,800
I chose to be the cat for a reason.

302
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,530
What?

303
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,940
I'm not sure if I'll win,

304
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,810
but I'm not here to lose.

305
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:23,480
So, you do have a plan?

306
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,420
It's not really a plan...

307
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,820
More like an inspiration.

308
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,290
--What is it, Takumi?
--Tell us!

309
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,160
No matter how fast she is,

310
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,000
she can't fly.

311
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,670
Yeah?

312
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:43,000
She's driving on four wheels, too.

313
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,670
Four wheels...?

314
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,670
Then I should be able to turn these corners

315
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:51,680
as fast and as well as she can,

316
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,310
don't you think?

317
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,850
You're right!

318
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,520
Theoretically, it's true.

319
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,860
That's crazy talk!

320
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,760
We're going!

321
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,660
Let's go, Mako!

322
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,770
Let's finish him quickly!

323
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:17,100
Okay, Sayuki. I'll show you the best race ever!

324
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,350
Wow!

325
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,980
They're going full throttle already!

326
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,590
Takumi's first "away" race has finally started.

327
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:11,360
Takumi is at a serious
disadvantage in this race, though.

328
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,560
I'm not worried...

329
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:18,090
...because I know he'll win!

330
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:40,350
<i>There was a time when I</i>
<i>wandered aimlessly, tired of love</i>

331
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:48,200
<i>I lost sight of myself and gave in to desire</i>

332
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,600
<i>But destiny is ever-changing</i>

333
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:02,240
<i>And charmed by innocent eyes</i>

334
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:10,150
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I hold you ever so tightly</i>

335
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:16,960
<i>All I can say is that I believe</i>
<i>my feelings are true</i>

336
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,130
<i>Let's enjoy our happiness...</i>

337
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:29,230
<i>Into our shining future</i>

338
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:48,860
<i>We'll prove countless times...</i>

339
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:54,930
<i>Our passion will last for eternity!</i>

340
00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:01,600
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I embrace you ever so tightly</i>

341
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:08,440
<i>Even if I lose everything that I have,</i>
<i>I will never let you go</i>

342
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,680
<i>Bloom, my beautiful...</i>

343
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:20,050
<i>...and miraculous flower</i>

344
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:29,530
<i>Mako, we can't lose on our own turf!</i>

345
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:32,670
<i>--We're street racers!</i>
<i>--Yeah.</i>

346
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:36,070
<i>What will you do if Mako quits racing, Sayuki?</i>

347
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,570
<i>--I'll still be racing!</i>
<i>--Sayuki...</i>

348
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:42,640
<i>--So, you won't retire?</i>
<i>--I'll be racing after men!</i>

349
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,250
<i>--Huh?</i>
<i>--Where are all the good men?</i>

350
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,480
<i>Where are they...?</i>

351
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,850
<i>See ya, Sayuki.</i>

352
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,250
<i>Next on Initial D...</i>

353
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,590
<i>"Hot Winds & Furious Driving!"</i>

354
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,750
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
