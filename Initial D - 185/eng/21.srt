<i>Get ready, yo! Now we blow up the horn</i>

6
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,460
<i>In the silver smoke amidst the frozen city</i>

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,130
<i>Payback for a dream I've seen so many times</i>

8
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,800
<i>My body is frozen in a</i>

00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,570

00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,050
<i>All from someone's whim</i>

13
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:00,290
<i>It seems like the world will end any minute</i>

14
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,160
<i>Break into the night, it's the time</i>

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,830
<i>With scared eyes, I'm lost in the night</i>

16
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,460
<i>Embraced by a falling dream</i>

17
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,100
<i>Scared of being alone, missin' my heart</i>

18
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,910
<i>Even hurting myself</i>

19
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,610
<i>Love me so much,</i>
<i>enough that I could fall apart</i>

20
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,250
<i>If only I could throw everything away</i>

21
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,920
<i>And just love you</i>

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,320
<i>Then I know I could face the truth</i>

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,460
Vroom!

24
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,000
And at the corner I went...

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,830
Voosh!

26
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,130
...as I cleared it.

27
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,640
At that moment, I was like the wind.

28
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,140
Nothing beats the pass.

29
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,180
When you have your own cars, go check it out.

30
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,510
My car? It's an Eight-Five,
every racer's dream car!

31
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,640
You probably didn't know that.

32
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:12,150
"Act 21: Challenge from a Superstar"

33
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,570
This summer was very memorable.

34
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,000
--Why?
--"Why?"

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Because I bought a car,

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,040
and you debuted in the
racing world like a comet.

37
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,240
Don't tease me like that.

38
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,650
One, two, three, four...

39
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,980
What are you counting?

40
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,220
Four is the number of
races you won this summer.

41
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,710
First, Keisuke Takahashi of the Red Suns' FD.

42
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,760
Second, Nakazato of the Night Kids' R32.

43
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,210
Third, the duct tape death match
with Shingo Shoji's EG6.

44
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:22,290
Finally, Mako and Sayuki's
Sileighty at Usui Pass.

45
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,270
Four for four.

46
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:35,380
Your undefeated legend began this summer.

47
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,450
You're no longer just a dummy.

48
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,050
Stop exaggerating.

49
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,550
Don't be embarrassed!

50
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,990
Keep winning, Takumi!

51
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,460
Until I beat you,

52
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:53,130
and become the fastest in Gunma--
no, in all of Kanto!

53
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,170
They'll be calling me... "Itsuki, Akina's Comet"!

54
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,790
Huh?

55
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,010
Since school ends early today,

56
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,310
let's go do something in the afternoon.

57
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,910
I kind of have to work in the afternoon.

58
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,120
What? You do?

59
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,590
I want to ride in your car again...

60
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,020
...because it's very cute.

61
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:25,490
If you say so... but it's my dad's car.

62
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,160
You said you wanted to buy a car.

63
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,130
Are you saving up?

64
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,970
I save most of what I make,

65
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,970
but I'm still far from it.

66
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,310
How much do you need?

67
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,810
Around a million yen.

68
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,480
A million...

69
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,480
How much do you have now?

70
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,810
Not even close.

71
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,650
Takumi?

72
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,790
What would you do if I gave you the money?

73
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,860
I wonder...

74
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,530
I bet you'd thank me,

75
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,530
and treat me like a princess.

76
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,700
You'd owe me big,

77
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,040
so you'd have to quit working

78
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,510
and take care of me and love me every day!

79
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,010
--I'm so embarrassed!
--Quit kidding around.

80
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,480
That's too much money
for us to come up with.

81
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,490
I know that!

82
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,990
I was just wondering.

83
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:31,330
You have no imagination.

84
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,260
That's too far off to imagine.

85
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,500
We now know that Takumi's
technique is the real deal

86
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,100
and will hold up anywhere.

87
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,840
It's more than just technique.

88
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,670
--Thank you very much.
--You need natural talent

89
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,340
to be able to race well on a new course.

90
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,180
He's a genius because he
defeated all those modern cars

91
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,120
with his ten-year-old Eight-Six.

92
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,790
--How gratifying!
--Get a load of you!

93
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,460
You're the one who said he
couldn't compete anywhere else

94
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,630
because he only knew Akina.

95
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,460
I know I did, but...

96
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,300
We all thought that.

97
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,970
Takumi is abnormal.

98
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,640
When I heard the news,
I was sure he'd lose at Usui

99
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,040
against Mako's Sileighty.

100
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,140
Sorry, Iketani.

101
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,310
Don't worry about it.

102
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,980
I've decided to go by
"Iketani the Lonely Driver."

103
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,310
That name sounds familiar.

104
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,220
Welcome.

105
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,330
Flowers?

106
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,060
Are you sure this isn't a mistake?

107
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,590
This is a gas station...

108
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,970
Takumi, this is for you.

109
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,070
Who is it from?

110
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,910
From Ryosuke Takahashi.

111
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,310
What?!

112
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,140
Ryosuke...

113
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,340
...Takahashi.

114
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,580
From the number-one superstar in Gunma...

115
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,310
...to Takumi!

116
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,790
What does it say?

117
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,590
Let me see.

118
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,860
"To Panda Trueno

119
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,860
9/15 10:00 PM, Mt. Akina Peak"

120
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,790
September 15th at 10 PM...

121
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,020
...at the top of Mount Akina.

122
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,470
Is that all it says?

123
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,200
It sounds like...

124
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,040
It's finally here.

125
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,970
A challenge from Ryosuke Takahashi

126
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,780
for a downhill battle.

127
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,180
Wow!

128
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,010
What are you gonna do?

129
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,680
You know he has to accept the challenge.

130
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,620
Takumi already smoked
Ryosuke's brother Keisuke.

131
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,790
That's right. Avoiding a rematch

132
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,020
is more humiliating than losing one.

133
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,810
What's the matter?

134
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,040
Don't you like being with me?

135
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:11,650
--Of course I do!
--You seem uninterested and preoccupied.

136
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,060
That's normal, I guess.

137
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,020
You seem so far away.

138
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,530
If this isn't fun, we should go.

139
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,160
It is fun!

140
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,170
Sorry, I apologize.

141
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,730
I'll forgive you if you tell me
what you were thinking about.

142
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,430
Well, I don't think you would really get it.

143
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,100
--Bye!
--Okay, I'll tell you!

144
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,850
A battle?

145
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,090
--Yeah.
--Is that like a fistfight?

146
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:51,690
No. A battle is a car race.

147
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,090
A car race?

148
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,800
I never knew that racing was your hobby.

149
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,440
It's not really my hobby, but I
guess it's kind of become one.

150
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,480
My next opponent is very
good and very well known.

151
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,720
I've been thinking about it since this morning.

152
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,990
I must be feeling the pressure.

153
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,060
You're a good driver, so you'll be okay.

154
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,430
It's not that easy.

155
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,800
If you don't want to race, just ignore him.

156
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,130
It's not that I don't want to.

157
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,470
I may lose to him,

158
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,900
but I don't want to not race him.

159
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,630
That's so like you.

160
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,840
You want to do it deep down, don't you?

161
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,850
You don't show it,

162
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,650
but I know you're very competitive.

163
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:53,750
I kind of like that about you.

164
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,430
Ready to go?

165
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:15,480
Why don't we talk a little more before we go?

166
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,040
Sure.

167
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:50,340
I know why you got in a fight
with that senior in the locker room.

168
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,380
After you quit the team,

169
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,690
your teammate told me why.

170
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,420
You stood up for me, didn't you?

171
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,730
I'm sorry I misunderstood you.

172
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,900
Don't be.

173
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:16,000
It doesn't matter now.

174
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,810
That's Takumi's Eight-Six.

175
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,670
Who is that girl?

176
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,850
Man, Keiichi Tsuchiya's drift is incredible!

177
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,150
Look.

178
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,190
Look at these pictures.

179
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,210
Takumi? Hey, Takumi!

180
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,290
What is it, Itsuki? Lunchtime?

181
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,960
You idiot!

182
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,490
Sorry, I was just talking to myself.

183
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,370
Takumi's been acting weird?

184
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,810
What's so weird?

185
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,480
He seems out of it.

186
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,140
That's normal.

187
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:41,850
I know, but he was better during the summer.

188
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,020
But when school started,

189
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,990
he suddenly got even worse than before.

190
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,330
Tired from all the races?

191
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,600
He just started racing this summer.

192
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,700
He may have lost his focus because of school.

193
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,540
I don't think that's it.

194
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,510
It's like something in his head broke.

195
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,950
Is he gonna be able to race like that?

196
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:17,790
He has a girlfriend, doesn't he?

197
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,590
What are you talking about?

198
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:24,730
I just thought he might
be daydreaming about her.

199
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,960
Daydreaming?

200
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,930
Just like how you were with Mako...

201
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:35,870
Kenji... that name is taboo here.

202
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,470
It's all right, Itsuki.

203
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,650
Anyway, I happened to see
Takumi driving with a girl.

204
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,080
Are you serious?!

205
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,550
I just got a glimpse, but she was pretty.

206
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,050
Takumi's girlfriend...

207
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:10,000
No wonder he's been
ditching me after school lately.

208
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,970
That traitor!

209
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:17,480
I've never even held a girl's hand!

210
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,310
That's it! That must be the reason!

211
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,750
I'm positive!

212
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,580
Leave it to me!

213
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,450
I'll take him out and interrogate him!

214
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:30,660
Racers don't need girls, right, Iketani?!

215
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,490
Right!

216
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:36,460
We are the "Lonely Drivers"!

217
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,660
This is sad.

218
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,690
What's on your mind?

219
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,690
You've been...

220
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,720
...dating Mogi behind my
back lately, haven't you?

221
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,500
Oh, is that all?

222
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,730
"Is that all"?!

223
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,000
It's no secret.

224
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But nothing special to tell, either.

225
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,170
No excuses! Just answer this question...

226
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,980
How far did you go?

227
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,180
Honestly, how far did you guys go?

228
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,880
How far?

229
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,350
Be honest with your best friend!

230
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,760
Itsuki, watch out!

231
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,200
I'll tell you!

232
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,830
Then tell me!

233
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,270
Last Sunday...

234
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,500
Sunday!

235
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,270
...the two of us...

236
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,870
The two of you...!

237
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,870
...went to Akina Lake.

238
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,440
Hey, Itsuki, watch out!

239
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,950
What I mean is...

240
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:08,960
...which base did you get to, you idiot?

241
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,360
Which base?

242
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,760
Did you kiss her?

243
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,130
--Sure.
--What?!

244
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,540
Hey, Itsuki, stop!

245
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,530
Stop the car!

246
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,310
<i>Yeah, he's daydreaming about her.</i>

247
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,420
Why are you staring at me?

248
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,650
You've been weird lately.

249
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,550
I have?

250
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,620
You never think much,

251
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,130
yet you've been so preoccupied.

252
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,300
I guess so.

253
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:54,970
<i>He probably can't stop</i>
<i>thinking about Mogi's soft lips.</i>

254
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,170
I've been wondering...

255
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:00,810
...what's gonna happen to us in the future.

256
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,140
In the future?!

257
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,610
<i>After kissing comes...</i>

258
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,180
How can you even bring up
such a shameful subject

259
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,190
in front of the "Lonely Driver"?!

260
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,820
There's only one thing left to do after kissing!

261
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,030
What's the one thing?

262
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,960
You know--<i>it</i>!

263
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,830
What are you talking about?!

264
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,830
You're not making any sense.

265
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:29,970
What I mean by the future is...

266
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:35,110
Never mind. Difficult thoughts
aren't my specialty.

267
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:39,780
<i>It looks like his daydreaming</i>
<i>can't be easily fixed.</i>

268
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:46,150
"Welcome to Touge

269
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:46,150
Altitude: 1434m"

270
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,150
No wonder.

271
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,250
It's Keisuke's FD and Kenta's S14.

272
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,680
Kenta is fast down the hill.

273
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,190
His non-turbo S14 is made for it.

274
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,360
Keisuke took him under his wing

275
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,030
and has been personally training him.

276
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,260
He's our number-two successor.

277
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,840
The battle against the
Night Kids is in two days.

278
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,340
Keisuke shouldn't be wasting time with Kenta.

279
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,780
He must be confident.

280
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,250
I guess Takeshi Nakazato is easy prey.

281
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,880
Keisuke's on fire lately.

282
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,720
Don't you think he's been
driving like Ryosuke lately?

283
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,720
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

284
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,960
Ryosuke must be feeling pretty
confident about his brother.

285
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,920
I heard that's why he's not coming to Myogi.

286
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:20,610
Can I ask you one thing, Keisuke?

287
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,080
What is it?

288
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,090
Why aren't we challenging the Eight-Six?

289
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:29,280
We should have him
come to Akagi for revenge.

290
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,890
--Akagi, huh?
--Sure!

291
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:38,400
There's no way you'll lose
to the Eight-Six on our turf.

292
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,830
If you won't do it...

293
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,270
...I will!

294
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,740
--Forget it, Kenta.
--Why?

295
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,070
You think he'll beat me?

296
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,910
Not on Akagi's downhill.

297
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,850
That's beside the point.

298
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,680
You're a Red Sun now, and don't forget it.

299
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,320
We race on our opponents' courses.

300
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,660
I know we do...

301
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,330
...but I can't take it.

302
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,960
The Eight-Six got the best of us!

303
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,930
If only we could battle fair and square...

304
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,600
Please let me take him!

305
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,430
Be patient!

306
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,480
Don't worry.

307
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,880
When the opportunity arises,

308
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,380
the person who needs to put
an end to it will do just that.

309
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,120
You mean...

310
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,820
...Ryosuke will?

311
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,990
Be patient. First, the Night Kids race.

312
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,790
Just leave everything to us.

313
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,080
He does seem weird.

314
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,020
See?! He confessed.

315
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,020
He is, indeed, daydreaming.

316
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,020
We gotta do something.

317
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:15,660
We only have one week until the big race.

318
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,220
We're in serious trouble.

319
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:24,860
"To Panda Trueno

320
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:24,860
9/15 10:00 PM, Mt. Akina Peak

321
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:24,860
From Ryosuke Takahashi"

322
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:40,350
<i>There was a time when I</i>
<i>wandered aimlessly, tired of love</i>

323
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:48,200
<i>I lost sight of myself and gave in to desire</i>

324
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,600
<i>But destiny is ever-changing</i>

325
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:02,240
<i>And charmed by innocent eyes</i>

326
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:10,150
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I hold you ever so tightly</i>

327
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:16,960
<i>All I can say is that I believe</i>
<i>my feelings are true</i>

328
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,130
<i>Let's enjoy our happiness...</i>

329
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:29,230
<i>Into our shining future</i>

330
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:48,860
<i>We'll prove countless times...</i>

331
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:54,930
<i>Our passion will last for eternity!</i>

332
00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:01,600
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I embrace you ever so tightly</i>

333
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:08,440
<i>Even if I lose everything that I have,</i>
<i>I will never let you go</i>

334
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,680
<i>Bloom, my beautiful...</i>

335
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:20,050
<i>...and miraculous flower</i>

336
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,200
<i>This is seriously not good!</i>

337
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,900
<i>What's not good, Itsuki?</i>

338
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,570
<i>--The big race is...</i>
<i>--Forget the race!</i>

339
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:37,900
<i>He's been daydreaming</i>
<i>about a girl at this crucial time!</i>

340
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,840
<i>--Daydreaming?</i>
<i>--He and Natsuki did this and that and...</i>

341
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,900
<i>...maybe they did "it," too!</i>

342
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,480
<i>--Not that again.</i>
<i>--Huh?</i>

343
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,520
<i>Next on Initial D: "Fierce Uphill Battle!"</i>

344
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,150
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
