So that's how you come out...

00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,420
That's all I needed.

"Act 6: A New Challenger"

39
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,800
Is it okay to drop you off
at this kind of a place?

40
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,480
It's all right, because my house is right there.

41
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,480
You said this car was pretty sad-looking,

42
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,580
but I like this car.

43
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,980
It runs smoothly,

44
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,820
and it's small and cute...

45
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,250
What kind of car is this?

46
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,650
It's a Trueno.

47
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,090
Trueno...

48
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,250
Let me ride in this Trueno again.

49
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,900
I had fun today, Takumi!

50
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,370
Bye-bye. I'll call you later.

51
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,340
She called you cute...

52
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,330
What are you going to do?

53
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,700
I can keep up with Ryosuke Takahashi!

54
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,690
As I thought, this GT-R is the best.

55
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,300
Even though the driver is good,

56
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,140
with the out-dated FC,

57
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,540
this is its limit, isn't it...?

58
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,760
I'm Ryosuke Takahashi.

59
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,520
I'm a member of the Red Suns.

60
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,830
I know.

61
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,560
I'm Takeshi Nakazato.

62
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,730
I belong to a team at Mt. Myogi
called the Night Kids.

63
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,400
Takeshi Nakazato of the Night Kids...?

64
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,400
Are you the fastest street racer
on Mt. Myogi's downhill?

65
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,370
I'm honored to be recognized by
the superstar, Ryosuke Takahashi.

66
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,510
But I've heard Nakazato of the Night Kids

67
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,070
is driving an S13, if I remember correctly...

68
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,720
It doesn't matter...

69
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,720
So what is a street racer
from Myogi doing at Akina?

70
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,460
Hang on a minute. Let's not talk about me.

71
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,030
You belong to Akagi, don't you?

72
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,630
Didn't we come here for the same reason?

73
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:09,640
I wanted to meet the Eight-Six I saw yesterday.

74
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,840
The one using the R32
tries to bite the Eight-Six?

75
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,210
With the R32, which is
tuned for 380 horsepower...

76
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,550
What?

77
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,180
I can see it easily

78
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,980
by looking at the exhaust

79
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,820
and its power on the straightaways.

80
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,550
But the result is obvious.

81
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,820
On the uphill, the Eight-Six
is no match for the R32.

82
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,090
On the downhill, there is no way

83
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,230
your R32 can beat the Eight-Six.

84
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,830
What did you say?

85
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,230
Are you saying my R32 will lose
to the Eight-Six on the downhill?!

86
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:45,610
Don't take it personally.
I'm just saying what I think.

87
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,780
You don't have much nerve.

88
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,180
Even though your brother lost,

89
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,680
there's no need to be so intimidated.

90
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,850
It's just an Eight-Six.

91
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,620
Once you race against it, you'll see.

92
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,920
I'm the only one who can beat him.

93
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,360
Don't joke with me.

94
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,990
You've already said it, and now
I can't walk away no matter what.

95
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,230
I'll beat the Eight-Six and
make you eat your words.

96
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,960
You can be arrogant for now.

97
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,470
Don't forget that I am Nakazato from Myogi!

98
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,740
I'm telling you now

99
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,570
that the rotary is not a match for this R32!

100
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,420
<i>...driving an S13, if I remember correctly...</i>

101
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,360
<i>That's right... since that time, I have changed.</i>

102
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,740
<i>Damn! I can't pass it!</i>

103
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,850
<i>Even if I get close in the corner,</i>

104
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,380
<i>he pulls away in the straightaway...</i>

105
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,620
<i>I have better technique as a racer!</i>

106
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,550
<i>Crap! How could I lose?!</i>

107
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,980
<i>With this S13, I can't beat an R32,</i>

108
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,320
<i>no matter what I do...</i>

109
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,920
<i>I, who was called the fastest</i>
<i>street racer on Mt. Myogi's downhill,</i>

110
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,050
<i>lost to an R32, which can't even do a drift...!</i>

111
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,530
<i>All cars have their limits.</i>

112
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,690
<i>No matter how excellent</i>
<i>the driver's technique is,</i>

113
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,600
<i>you can't drive beyond the car's limit.</i>

114
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,090
<i>Even that Eight-Six...!</i>

115
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,340
Good morning!

116
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,540
Hey!

117
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,310
Here, Iketani!

118
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,010
What's that?

119
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,520
Fried tofu.

120
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,280
It's left over from yesterday.

121
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,290
My father told me to bring it to you.

122
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,450
Oh, really?

123
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,620
I'll put it in the refrigerator.

124
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,790
Wow... I'm surprised he thought of me...

125
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,860
--By the way, Takumi...
--Yeah...?

126
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,700
Is it true that you've been delivering tofu

127
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,800
to Lake Akina for the last five years?

128
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,540
Yeah...

129
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:33,310
I thought we were friends.
Why didn't you tell me?

130
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:37,910
Because if I talked about it,
we could have gotten into trouble...

131
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,980
Well... I guess so...

132
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,820
Five years ago,

133
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,880
we were just starting junior high...

134
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,530
You've driven much longer than I have.

135
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,590
Since junior high,
you've been driving every day,

136
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,530
even in the snow and rain, on Mt. Akina.

137
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,770
It's early in the morning.
So I don't see anyone...

138
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:05,270
No, not that! Those corners!
Weren't you scared?

139
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,840
Well... in the beginning, I was scared.

140
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,450
But the fear was completely
gone within six months.

141
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,820
When I accelerate, the tires slip naturally.

142
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,290
So it took another half year

143
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,290
until I could slip and control them as I wanted.

144
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,690
That means...

145
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,330
...you mastered the downhill in a year.

146
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,690
If you do it every day,

147
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,860
your nervousness about
slipping disappears quickly.

148
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,630
I had nothing to do,

149
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,040
so I started to see how close
I could get to the guardrails...

150
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,800
Would a normal person do
something that dangerous?!

151
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,540
I never thought it was dangerous.

152
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,880
When I'm at my best, I can
get as close as about 1 cm.

153
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,550
One... one centimeter?!

154
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,380
Unless I find fun stuff to do like that,

155
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,880
it's pretty boring

156
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,250
helping with my father's business.

157
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:56,990
That's why I've never thought I
wanted to improve as a driver...

158
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,730
But I would get impatient,

159
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,390
and would want to get home faster.

160
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,000
So when I don't have tofu on the way back,

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,900
I go as fast as I can.

162
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,270
--Takumi... can I ask you a question?
--Yes...

163
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,340
How do you drive when
you have tofu in the car?

164
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,710
If you go too fast, you'll
damage the tofu, won't you?

165
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,910
I can't go very fast on the uphill...

166
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,220
My father puts water in a paper cup

167
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,750
and puts it in the cup holder.

168
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,590
If I can drive without spilling the water,

169
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,450
he says I won't damage
the tofu, even if I'm going fast.

170
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,530
In the beginning, I found it to be very difficult.

171
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:36,530
Even when I drove slowly, it spilled all over...

172
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,130
I would think so...

173
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,700
Brake, steering wheel, shifting, gas pedal...

174
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,870
If even one of them is a
little rough, the water spills.

175
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,610
My father often says to roll
the water in the paper cup.

176
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,880
Roll the water in the cup?

177
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,210
I suppose it's the surface tension...

178
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,780
The water's surface tension

179
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,890
makes it roll around the rim of the cup.

180
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,990
At each corner,

181
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,980
I roll the water to the edge
of the rim as I drive up the hill.

182
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,730
It took me a long time

183
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,070
to be able to drift without spilling the water.

184
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,100
Drift without spilling the water?!

185
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,900
Can you really do that?!

186
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,270
Don't lie! You're just joking, right?!

187
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:25,180
The primary point in controlling
a car is the center of balance.

188
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,020
The Drift King, Keiichi Tsuchiya,
also says so in the video...

189
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,850
In order to drive without spilling
the water in the paper cup,

190
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:36,790
you have to master the car's center of balance.

191
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,190
Not to mention drifting...

192
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,600
It's impossible to do that!

193
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,030
I'm not lying!

194
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,570
Just because you beat Keisuke Takahashi...

195
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,640
You're carrying it way too far! I know better...

196
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,710
--Oh, a customer.
--Oops...

197
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,410
Welcome!

198
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,900
Fill it up with high octane? Yes, sir!

199
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,210
<i>Amazing, Bunta...</i>

200
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,720
<i>His technique is way above</i>
<i>just a regular mountain racer...</i>

201
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,080
Thank you very much!

202
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,660
Takumi! I have a favor to ask.

203
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,330
Can you let me ride next to you

204
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,090
when you do the downhill at Akina?

205
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,410
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

206
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,340
You want to use the car?

207
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,110
At this time of the day?

208
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,880
Oh, well, I didn't think you'd let me.

209
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,080
That's all right. It's not a big deal.

210
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,780
I don't mind.

211
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,390
Are you sure?

212
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,360
Don't you need the car for anything?

213
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,060
Like a meeting at the Chamber
of Commerce or something?

214
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,530
You'd better think a little bit.

215
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,800
What are you talking about?

216
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,530
You sound like you'll be in trouble
if I don't have to use the car.

217
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,530
Well, no... I didn't mean that...

218
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,100
Then take the car.

219
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,370
But in return, you need to
pick me up at my meeting.

220
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,000
So you do have a meeting!

221
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,420
My heart is really beating fast!

222
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,360
It's like just before getting on the
extreme ride at the amusement park.

223
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,260
Oh, shoot! Lucky you! I'm envious!

224
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,660
I don't think it's that much fun.

225
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm going, Iketani.

226
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,200
Yeah! I can count on you, Takumi! Go all out!

227
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,430
Shoo, shoo! Get away, you guys!

228
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,350
It sounds great!

229
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,870
It's the best! A turbo can
never sound like that!

230
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,700
<i>The first corner is coming up.</i>

231
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,530
<i>I'll figure out what he does different from me,</i>

232
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,200
<i>and then steal his technique...</i>

233
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,510
Hey...! Hey!

234
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,030
Takumi! Brake!

235
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,680
<i>How... How can he control the car like this?</i>

236
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,550
<i>What's going on?!</i>

237
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,150
Incredible...

238
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,900
<i>The speedometer warning sound is on!</i>

239
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,030
<i>That means it is way over 100 km/hr.</i>

240
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,560
<i>We're coming up on the next corner!</i>

241
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,640
The Eight-Six is back already?

242
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,170
I wonder what happened.

243
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,160
It's too early to return from the bottom.

244
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,880
He passed out...

245
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,860
Takumi!

246
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,890
Which corner was it?

247
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,360
The third one...?

248
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:49,940
"Iketani Passes Out!"

249
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,330
Wow! I... I saw it!

250
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,070
The agonized cry of his last
moment echoed through Mt. Akina!

251
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,270
The scary downhill!

252
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:46,370
Iketani, in the third corner...

253
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,210
...passed out!

254
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,910
It must be true...

255
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,110
Wow! Mr. Tachibana! Why are you here?!

256
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,350
I was curious...

257
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,190
I suppose I'm not welcome...

258
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,460
Take your time...

259
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,330
I know that guy.

260
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:16,800
Nakazato of the Night Kids
has no opponent in Myogi.

261
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,310
I can't be impressed

262
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,010
by the technique of a person who drives a R32.

263
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,980
It's just that the car is fast. That's all.

264
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,180
I wonder if that's true...

265
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,810
You don't think so, brother?

266
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:29,680
Here we go again. Keisuke hates the R32.

267
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,490
But, Ryosuke...

268
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,760
I don't think it's good if
Nakazato defeats him first.

269
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,060
If the Night Kids beat

270
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,830
the Eight-Six that we couldn't beat...

271
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:46,030
...it may look like the Red Suns
are a notch lower than the Night Kids.

272
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,500
That's the way rumors go...

273
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,410
I think that's Nakazato's plan.

274
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,010
I don't think you need to worry about it.

275
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:59,550
There is no one in the Night Kids
who can beat the Eight-Six.

276
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,380
As long as it's the downhill of Akina,

277
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,320
no one can beat him.

278
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,020
Only my brother can handle it.

279
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:12,060
The Eight-Six is fast and on a higher level.

280
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,360
I don't get it...

281
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,800
Why can't the new state-of-the-art cars

282
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,970
with high power beat the Eight-Six?

283
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,800
Sometimes a car has too much
power to do the job. That's all.

284
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,840
What?!

285
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,810
The turbo power is a strong
weapon on the straightaway,

286
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,910
but coming out of the corner,
it hinders the car's behavior.

287
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,850
It's like a double-edged sword.

288
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,250
From that aspect...

289
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,350
...once the Eight-Six is set,
it can go faster and faster.

290
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,890
On the technical courses
where the straights are short,

291
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,860
sometimes the car that
is aggressive can be faster,

292
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,660
even though it doesn't have much power.

293
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,160
Keisuke's turbo, which had increased power,

294
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,930
had the opposite effect...

295
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,400
That's right...

296
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,540
On the downhill of Akina,
the total amount of time I could use...

297
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,740
...all of its 350 horses was very little.

298
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,710
Right after the moment I thought
I had pulled far away from him,

299
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,680
I had to brake for the next corner,

300
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,650
and the time it took before I could
accelerate was too long, and it irritated me.

301
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:12,320
Well, that is what happens
with the FR that transmits power

302
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,990
to the road surface using only the rear tires.

303
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,360
Hey, wait a minute!

304
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,530
Then what will happen
with the R32 that is a 4WD?

305
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,630
The ATTESA E-TS System
can give stable traction

306
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,330
even when giving it the gas,

307
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,700
so he can use the turbo power

308
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,230
as much as he wants, can't he?

309
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,800
Nakazato's R32 may
be able to beat the Eight-Six...

310
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,810
Thank you very much!

311
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,710
Welcome!

312
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,250
"Yuno Hana Manju"

313
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,250
"Pharmacy"

314
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,250
"Tagawa Liquor"

315
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,660
But I feel strange...

316
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,400
The way I look at you has changed...

317
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,760
What's that?

318
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,430
Have another <i>onsen-manju</i> ["hot spring bun"].

319
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,960
Yeah...

320
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,940
When you're doing that,
it's the regular Takumi.

321
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,480
A spacey guy who looks
sleepy and eats <i>manju.</i>

322
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,120
Calling me a spacey guy is pretty rude.

323
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,520
But...

324
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,160
...once you're in the
driver's seat of the Eight-Six

325
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,630
and jump onto the mountain...

326
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,000
...you are the pride of
the street racers in Akina!

327
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,170
The hero everyone admires!

328
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,470
Really?

329
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,670
Is that right?

330
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,840
It's embarrassing...

331
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,170
I told you I'm not talking about now!

332
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,980
Now you're just a spacey
guy who is eating <i>manju.</i>

333
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,210
To tell you the truth, I feel kind of strange...

334
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,680
About what?

335
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,390
During the last race,

336
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,520
and yesterday when I had Iketani ride with me,

337
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,060
I was just driving as usual.

338
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,900
I don't understand why
everyone is so excited about it.

339
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:08,200
I've never done anything that
makes other people happy.

340
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,210
<i>I'm starting to think...</i>

341
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,540
<i>...that driving is becoming fun...</i>

342
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,380
--Hey!
--What?

343
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,930
A black R32?

344
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,700
That's the one we've seen a lot recently.

345
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,800
Crap! He's on my bumper!

346
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,130
Don't let it pass us! Try hard!

347
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,240
Yeah... On the downhill,
the difference in power is smaller.

348
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,110
We have the Eight-Six that beat the FD!

349
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,090
<i>Small fish!</i>

350
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,870
He passed on the outside!

351
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,090
What a thrill! A completely
different level of acceleration.

352
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,390
As I thought...

353
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:40,130
...in reality, it is impossible
to race and beat a power car...

354
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,620
...with a gutless car.

355
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,600
<i>This is an amazing machine.</i>

356
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,270
<i>Since I switched to this car,</i>

357
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:55,810
<i>my former rivals are no longer a match for me.</i>

358
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:59,410
<i>I lost the opponents who</i>
<i>made me run seriously.</i>

359
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,380
<i>The drift game,</i>

360
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,420
<i>which has become popular recently</i>
<i>but is just flash, is not my style.</i>

361
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,420
<i>Unless it is an extreme battle,</i>

362
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,760
<i>which attacks with gripping tires</i>
<i>and makes me concentrate totally,</i>

363
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,030
<i>I have no use for it.</i>

364
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,430
<i>Come out!</i>

365
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,860
<i>Akina's Eight-Six!</i>

366
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,330
<i>At first glance, I felt it!</i>

367
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,330
<i>You are enough of an opponent for me.</i>

368
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,460
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

369
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,530
<i>Sou tanin wa kaizai shinai</i>

370
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,060
<i>Never stop, tomaritakunai</i>

371
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,130
<i>Gisei ni natta ai ga cry shite mo</i>

372
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,930
<i>Peak mezashite, sweep the winding street</i>

373
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,140
<i>Beep beep! Keikokuon wa so cheap!</i>

374
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,600
<i>Sheep-tachi wa michi wo akero</i>

375
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,040
<i>'Cuz I'm never gonna stop, streak my dream</i>

376
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,910
<i>Easy na motivation subete wa simulation</i>

377
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,980
<i>Nigetemitatte doko demo safety zone</i>

378
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,990
<i>Nani ka wo te ni irete nani ka wo wasureteku</i>

379
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,920
<i>Sekai ga kowaretemo kawaranai</i>

380
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:24,000
<i>Beasty shout, dare no te ni sae oenai</i>

381
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,370
<i>Hageshii yume jikan sae mo ima koeteku</i>

382
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,410
<i>Rage your dream, yami o harisaite iku</i>

383
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,380
<i>Like a streak to the peak</i>

384
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:43,520
<i>Sekaijuu no kogekitta yoru o keshiteku</i>

385
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,390
<i>Rage your dream, michi o hiraiteku</i>

386
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,060
<i>Di-ding down, another round never slow down</i>

387
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,060
<i>Konma zero-ichibyou de knockdown</i>

388
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,260
<i>Yoin nokoshikietekou to the next town</i>

389
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,100
<i>Hokori mau haishachi ni hau</i>

390
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,060
<i>Rikutsu dake no nougakitachi</i>

391
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,030
<i>Jamakusai kara shikato shitekou</i>

392
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,170
<i>Streaker satte yuku street no mukou</i>

393
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,370
<i>Something they would know</i>

394
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,410
<i>Rage your dream, tsuzuku hatenai michi wo</i>

395
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,410
<i>Ai mo kako mo furimukazu</i>

396
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:15,480
<i>Yukeru anata kagayaiteiru</i>

397
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,550
<i>Rage your dream, ima o ikiteiru</i>

398
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,400
<i>I heard about it!</i>

399
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,360
<i>You were a very famous</i>
<i>street racer in Akina once.</i>

400
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,770
<i>Yeah. I often drove with Bunta.</i>

401
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:39,770
<i>Now in Akina, Takumi is going to have</i>
<i>to race with Nakazato of the Night Kids.</i>

402
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,210
<i>Yeah... But Takumi doesn't want to race.</i>

403
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:46,250
<i>What?! Then we can't see them race!</i>

404
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,520
<i>Don't worry. I have an idea.</i>

405
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,350
<i>Leave it to me.</i>

406
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:54,620
<i>Next time on Initial D, "A Racer's Pride."</i>

407
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,060
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
