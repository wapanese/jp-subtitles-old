Don't forget to check the air pressure, too.

35
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,690
Right...

36
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,700
I bet today's race will be another easy win.

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,530
--It won't even be close.
--Shut up and keep working!

38
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,910
What is it...?

39
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,740
Hey, get me that lug wrench.

40
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,080
What are they doing?

41
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,520
They're changing the FD's tires.

42
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,120
They seem to have several spares in that van.

43
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,290
They're changing the tires
to suit the conditions...

44
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,700
They act like professionals...

45
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,460
Crap...

46
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,100
It's ready to go any time, Keisuke.

47
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,600
What? Ah...thanks.

48
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,970
Isn't it past 10 yet?

49
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,970
Well... It's about 9:40...

50
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,390
Dammit...!

51
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,190
It hasn't come yet...

52
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,690
Brother, that Eight-Six...

53
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,360
...irritates me!

54
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,890
I was convinced that it could represent Akina...

55
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,600
Was I ever wrong! I've lost all my enthusiasm!

56
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,370
Now I'm going for the best time,
and I'll run away from them.

57
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,740
And I'm going to humiliate them.

58
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,670
If I don't, I won't be able to stand it!

59
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,110
Iketani, it's almost time.

60
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,510
Yeah... I know!

61
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,260
What's that?

62
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,530
Iketani!

63
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,230
Iketani!!

64
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,030
Itsuki...

65
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,640
What...What about the timed run?

66
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,470
We're going to start in a bit.

67
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,840
Good! I'm in time!

68
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,040
And who's representing the Speed Stars?

69
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,480
Well...

70
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,580
Kenji, get ready... at least mentally...

71
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,480
Yeah...

72
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,190
You're representing the team?!

73
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,020
Good luck! I'll be cheering you on!

74
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,160
This is the starting line.

75
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,990
Are you ready?

76
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,370
This is the finish line.

77
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,500
Everyone is in their designated positions.

78
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,540
You can start any time.

79
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,440
Roger!

80
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,710
So...should we start now?

81
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,950
He didn't come after all...

82
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,120
I'm counting on you, Kenji.

83
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,710
Yeah...

84
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,560
Are you kidding? This is my opponent?

85
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,670
Kenji.

86
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,670
You look pale.

87
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,970
You're sweating...

88
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,040
We're even feeling kinda
sick just watching you.

89
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,910
That's easy for you to say... But...

90
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,980
Toughen up! Get mean!

91
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,710
All right. We'll start the countdown.

92
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,310
Damn...!

93
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,350
10 seconds!

94
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,750
Wait a minute!

95
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,590
This is the finish line. A regular car
just passed us and went up there.

96
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,900
You don't want to pass it during the race...

97
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,730
Should we wait until it reaches the top?

98
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,600
This is a public road.

99
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,570
There's always going to be regular cars!

100
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,370
Forget about it! Start us!

101
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,510
All right.

102
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,610
Wait a minute!

103
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,200
Can you ask him what make that car was?

104
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,250
Could you tell what kind of car it was?

105
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,220
Well... I think it was a car
with flip-up headlights...

106
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,690
I think it was probably a Trueno, an Eight-Six...

107
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,690
Give that to me!

108
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,160
What color was the Eight-Six?!

109
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,870
Why are you guys so curious about that thing?

110
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,670
It was black and white.

111
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,640
It's a Panda Trueno.

112
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,200
He's here!

113
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,210
He showed up! My prey.

114
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,480
What are you going to do?
Is it okay to begin the countdown?

115
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,980
Not yet!

116
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,550
Wait until the Eight-Six arrives.

117
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:35,490
My real opponent shouldn't be
the 180 next to me. Right?

118
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,330
Yeah, that's right.

119
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,330
Kenji, you can go back now.

120
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,730
Yeah... That's quite a relief...

121
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,330
Your eyes are watering.

122
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,500
Yours, too!

123
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,110
He came through for us...

124
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,680
...so that he could protect the
Akina street racers' pride...

125
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,780
That's enough for me...!

126
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,270
Now I can start feeling like I don't
care about who wins or loses.

127
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,500
<i>What is this...?</i>

128
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,540
<i>It seems strange...</i>

129
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,540
<i>There are people at each turn...</i>

130
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,810
<i>What are they doing here...?</i>

131
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,850
<i>I think I came to a weird place...</i>

132
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,320
<i>Oh, well, I guess it's all right...</i>
<i>If I win, I get a full tank of gas.</i>

133
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,910
<i>And I can go to the ocean without any pressure.</i>

134
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,440
What's up, Takeshi?

135
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,870
Nice technique!

136
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,540
The way the back end moved
when it pulled out of the corner...

137
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,510
...was a nice touch.

138
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,350
What?!

139
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,480
Didn't you see it?

140
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,880
If you say so... But...

141
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:16,190
To us it just looked like a regular
Eight-Six with a brat driving it.

142
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,060
A car driven by a street racer
who is at a level where

143
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,230
he can maneuver it as easily
as his own hands and feet...

144
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,460
...has an aura about it.

145
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,970
Ryosuke Takahashi's driving has a strong aura.

146
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,740
His younger brother
Keisuke's aura is still weak.

147
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,040
But that Eight-Six was emitting a strong aura.

148
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,250
If he represents Akina...

149
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,480
...the winner is up in the air.

150
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,490
<i>He's almost here.</i>

151
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,260
<i>He really came.</i>

152
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,660
<i>The fastest man on Akina's downhill!</i>

153
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,530
<i>The legendary super technician!</i>

154
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:58,830
<i>We'll show the Takahashi Brothers</i>
<i>Akina's real strength!</i>

155
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,700
<i>Come on, Eight-Six!</i>

156
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,010
<i>I'm looking forward to seeing</i>
<i>who gets out of the car.</i>

157
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,340
<i>It's been a while since I've been so excited.</i>

158
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,640
<i>He's kept us waiting for so long...</i>

159
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,780
<i>But such an obvious</i>
<i>strategy won't work on me.</i>

160
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,480
<i>I'll be watching you very closely.</i>

161
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,450
Here it comes!

162
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,290
Give him a path! Show him to the starting line!

163
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,140
What's that car?

164
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,470
Everyone was waiting for that car.

165
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,340
But it's an Eight-Six.

166
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:43,570
Crap! Where did all these people come from?!

167
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,050
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

168
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,160
Excuse me...!

169
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,070
Oh, the Eight-Six! Is it...?!

170
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,210
Takumi!

171
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,230
Wow! It's him!

172
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,880
So this is the guy...

173
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,910
Takumi!

174
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,110
What's going on?!

175
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,380
What happened to your father?!

176
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,310
My father told me to show up.

177
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,380
Even if the car is here, without
your father, what good is it?

178
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,650
What?!

179
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,390
What are you going to do, Iketani?

180
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,990
--This isn't... what you said...
--Because you said... we're all right...

181
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,690
<i>--I knew I shouldn't have come.</i>
--Kenji has to race after all...!

182
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,060
<i>Damn my old man! He really irritates me!</i>

183
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,560
Takumi! Didn't your father say anything else?!

184
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,930
He just told me...

185
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:16,200
...to beat the FD on Akina's downhill.

186
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,340
What?!

187
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,040
Did he tell you to drive?

188
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,540
Yes...

189
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,210
Can you beat...

190
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,020
...Keisuke Takahashi?

191
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,750
Well... I can't be sure until we really race...

192
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,360
I've beaten him before...

193
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,560
You won once before...?!

194
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,700
A full tank of gas is riding on this race...

195
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,890
...so if you let me, I'll win no matter what.

196
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,940
Excuse me... Excuse me...

197
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,540
Takumi! You idiot!

198
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,280
Ouch! What are you doing?!

199
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,480
Takumi! Just how stupid are you?!

200
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,390
I'm so embarrassed watching
you that I'm blushing!

201
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,890
Move your car right now!

202
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,090
Don't interfere with the race!

203
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,920
Get in that Eight-Six now!

204
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,490
Wait a minute, Itsuki.

205
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,400
Iketani! I'm so sorry!

206
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,870
He is so stupid that he
doesn't understand anything.

207
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,370
Please forgive him!

208
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:24,770
Takumi... Do you, by any chance,

209
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:28,080
also deliver tofu, along with your father?

210
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,580
Now I do all of the deliveries.
For the past five years.

211
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,670
For the past five years?

212
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,690
Now I understand. Takumi!

213
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,260
All right. I'll put you in
charge of the downhill race.

214
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,260
What are you talking about, Iketani?!

215
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,460
If a novice like Takumi
tries the Akina downhill,

216
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,030
within minutes he'll cause
an accident and he'll die!

217
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,900
Don't worry about it. You need
to step aside and just watch.

218
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,640
Thanks for coming, Takumi.

219
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,040
I'm counting on you.

220
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,310
Yeah...

221
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,520
I'm sorry that we kept you waiting.

222
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,490
Really! I'm tired of waiting!

223
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,190
You're pretty young...

224
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,660
What's your name?

225
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,490
Takumi Fujiwara.

226
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,400
I'll remember your name.

227
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,330
I'm Keisuke Takahashi.

228
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,100
I won't make the same mistake twice.

229
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,040
Is it really all right?

230
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,580
It's totally foolish to race
an Eight-Six against a FD.

231
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,210
There's a huge difference in horsepower,

232
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,850
and the FD is the best
domestic cornering machine.

233
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,090
Both in the straights and in the turns,

234
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,790
the Eight-Six is outclassed!

235
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,350
We just need to have faith in him...

236
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,400
Then we'll begin the countdown.

237
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,240
--Roger!
--Roger!

238
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,310
Ten seconds to green!

239
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,510
Nine! Eight!

240
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,010
Seven! Six!

241
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,680
Five! Four! Three!

242
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,020
Two! One!

243
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,580
Go!

244
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,450
Fast! Keisuke Takahashi's FD!

245
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,850
350 horses are no joke.

246
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,420
His shifting is perfect.

247
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,950
It's no match.

248
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:57,390
At full acceleration, the Eight-Six
looked like it was standing still.

249
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,690
Takumi...

250
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:07,400
<i>Coming off the line, that Eight-Six</i>
<i>has 150 horsepower at most.</i>

251
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,510
<i>It's not quite the monster</i>
<i>Keisuke was talking about.</i>

252
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,140
<i>The reason why it can shift so fast</i>

253
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,980
<i>is that it has tranny gears for a rally.</i>

254
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,310
<i>It must be perfect for the hairpins on Akina.</i>

255
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,580
<i>Still, there's no reason</i>

256
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:26,420
<i>Keisuke's FD would be beat out by it.</i>

257
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,520
<i>The monster isn't the car...</i>

258
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,520
<i>...but the driver?!</i>

259
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,770
<i>I won't give him a break.</i>

260
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,040
<i>I don't like using the</i>
<i>straightaways to pull ahead,</i>

261
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,540
<i>but this is a timed run.</i>

262
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,270
<i>I'll never even see that</i>
<i>Eight-Six in my rearview mirror.</i>

263
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,320
What's that?!

264
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,550
This is the first corner! It's great!
The Eight-Six's line is incredible!

265
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,320
It wasn't more than 5 cm from the guardrail!

266
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,520
I've never seen anyone corner at that speed!

267
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,110
<i>What?!</i>

268
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,580
<i>He's closing the gap?!</i>

269
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,600
<i>He's getting closer?!</i>

270
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,320
<i>It must be my imagination!</i>

271
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,680
<i>It's impossible!</i>

272
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,170
Are... Are you serious?!

273
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:56,940
Takumi's father was once a great street racer?

274
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,370
Yeah.

275
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,210
I've seen him several times,

276
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,180
but he's just the gruff owner of the tofu shop.

277
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,110
I guess you really can't tell much
about a person by just looking at them.

278
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:11,350
According to Mr. Tachibana, he's still
the fastest on the downhill in Akina.

279
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,490
Anyway, that's who sent Takumi in his place,

280
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,330
so we should just believe in Takumi.

281
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,230
Yeah... It's much better than if I had run.

282
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,630
But even if his father is fast, Takumi is...

283
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:31,340
It sounds like Takumi beat
Keisuke Takahashi once before.

284
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,540
What?!

285
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:37,140
Takumi defeated Keisuke Takahashi?! No way!

286
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,820
I can't believe it! That spacey Takumi?!

287
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,080
He didn't even know what an Eight-Six was!

288
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,540
What?! What's in that Eight-Six?!

289
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,170
At incredible speed, it came
in with the rear end free

290
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,140
and it passed through
at an unbelievable speed!

291
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,780
It wouldn't be surprising if it
went airborne at any moment!

292
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,970
We've got shivers going up our spines!

293
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,690
<i>He's caught up to me?!</i>

294
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,990
<i>What's happening? I must be going crazy!</i>

295
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,560
Up to second gear, they're the same,

296
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,530
but the stretch is different...

297
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,830
If the straight is even a
little long, he'll pull away...

298
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,080
This is the straightaway
in front of the skating rink.

299
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,780
The two of them just passed by!

300
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,750
He's on Keisuke's bumper!

301
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,420
Akina's Eight-Six is unbelievably fast!

302
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,720
Is this for real?!

303
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,060
Keisuke's FD has never had
anyone keep up with it this far!

304
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,770
Man, I've got goosebumps...

305
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,270
On this long straightaway,
Keisuke pulled away,

306
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:46,810
but after this, there are many
hairpins. It may be a problem!

307
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,410
Did you hear him, Ryosuke?

308
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,440
We miscalculated...

309
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,710
We didn't know Akina had such a great driver...

310
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,850
Great attack!

311
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,520
That Eight-Six's attack was aggressive.
It was an incredible kamikaze technique!

312
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,080
He's got no sense of fear on the downhill.

313
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,130
<i>In the straights, I'm faster.</i>

314
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,960
<i>But he's caught up to me.</i>

315
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,570
<i>That means I'm losing in the corners.</i>

316
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,040
<i>To be caught by a less powerful car</i>

317
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,940
<i>is the ultimate shame for a street racer!</i>

318
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,640
<i>I'll die before admitting that!</i>

319
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,880
<i>My old man...</i>

320
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,010
<i>Unless I pass that car,</i>
<i>he won't admit that I won...</i>

321
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,490
<i>There's no other way...</i>
<i>I guess I have to do that...</i>

322
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,160
<i>A full tank of gas is riding on this...</i>

323
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,760
<i>The setup point is in the next</i>
<i>five consecutive hairpin curves!</i>

324
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,460
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

325
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,530
