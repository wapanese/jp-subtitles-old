That's the way, Mako!

38
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,220
An obstacle! Move inside.

39
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,650
Not bad.

40
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,790
He's not like other racers. He's still with us.

41
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,990
Good. There's more to look forward to.

42
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,990
I wonder how long he can keep it up?

43
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,760
We're just getting started.

44
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,010
<i>Man, I'm not racing.</i>

45
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,480
<i>I'm just "riding" the race,</i>

46
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,810
<i>like a roller coaster.</i>

47
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,350
<i>I'm so out of sync that it's scary.</i>

48
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,660
<i>But if I fall behind, I won't be able to catch up.</i>

49
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,460
<i>Stay close!</i>

50
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,560
<i>I never realized that course</i>
<i>knowledge was so important.</i>

51
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,340
<i>Losing my focus would mean</i>

52
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,710
<i>crashing into a wall or falling off a cliff.</i>

53
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,660
No wonder people are talking
about that Eight-Six lately.

54
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,060
We can't shake him off easily.

55
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,160
He is about to experience the
terror of Usui's severe turns.

56
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,260
--Narrow right turn ahead!
--Okay!

57
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,450
<i>She's fast! Damn!</i>

58
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,850
<i>But I gotta stay close!</i>

59
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,550
<i>If she can, I can!</i>

60
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:19,240
Takumi said that if she could make
it around the corners, so could he.

61
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,140
That's exactly what he said.

62
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,480
That's an unbelievably childish idea.

63
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,650
What's wrong with his head?

64
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,150
But it's amazing that he said that.

65
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,820
Someone with lesser abilities
wouldn't think that.

66
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,790
He can probably control his run

67
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,130
if he doesn't go beyond his limitations.

68
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,330
Of course he can!

69
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,830
But he's racing against Mako,

70
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,670
who knows everything there is
to know about this course.

71
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,170
I'm sure she enters each
corner as fast as possible

72
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:56,680
so Takumi will have to do the same,

73
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,340
even though he knows
nothing about this course.

74
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,250
I get chills just thinking about it.

75
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:12,360
Yeah, it demands both
technique and true courage.

76
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,030
One mistake...

77
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,000
...and he's finished.

78
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,010
<i>He's racing a Sileighty...</i>

79
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,480
<i>What the heck is that?</i>

80
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,300
He's right behind me!

81
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,170
Why? Am I not going fast enough?

82
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,070
No, you're doing great, Mako.

83
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,810
But he's on me!

84
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,410
Don't worry about him,
or you'll mess up your rhythm.

85
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,150
Leave what's going on behind us to me.

86
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,150
It's only just started.

87
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,820
Let's enjoy this awesome race!

88
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,820
Right. I trust you.

89
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,260
Just believe in your partner!

90
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,390
You and I are the fastest team in Usui!

91
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,070
If the mouse gets away, it's over.

92
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:35,580
If not, we keep switching
positions until someone wins.

93
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,680
It's a "sudden-death death match."

94
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,780
With this rule, you should go in front first.

95
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,290
It won't end with one race,

96
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,260
but at least you get one practice.

97
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,250
It's better to lose in the second race.

98
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,960
I'll chase her first.

99
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,630
Think it over, Takumi!

100
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,900
This is my race, so let me decide.

101
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,210
<i>I'm in trouble.</i>

102
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:14,050
<i>I chose to chase her 'cuz I didn't</i>
<i>want her chasing me, but...</i>

103
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,950
<i>...this is tough.</i>

108
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,400
<i>Keisuke's loss and Nakazato</i>
<i>losing his lead were due to this.</i>

109
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,350
<i>Course knowledge gives</i>
<i>the racer an advantage,</i>

110
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,620
<i>regardless of his technique.</i>

111
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,280
<i>So, how can I beat the Eight-Six?</i>

112
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,840
<i>According to my theory,</i>
<i>I can win even at Akina Pass.</i>

113
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,620
<i>Man, I was too optimistic.</i>

114
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,350
<i>I took a risky challenge.</i>

115
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,850
<i>The difference of a few</i>
<i>inches and a little speed</i>

116
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,660
<i>at the start of a turn makes</i>
<i>a huge difference at the exit.</i>

117
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,790
<i>Too wide!</i>

118
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,900

<i>helps a racer grow bigger and better.</i>

122

<i>With his exceptional concentration</i>
<i>and sense, his refined technique...</i>

123
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,730
<i>...and, of course, my Eight-Six,</i>

124
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,500
<i>which I have perfected over the years...</i>

125
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,100

128
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,950
I wonder what happened?

129
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,280
Maybe it's over.

130
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,950
It's not over until they come back.

131
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:35,360
This race is one-sided,
no matter how you look at it.

132
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,360
But, Iketani...

133
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,130
He's never had a race
that's been favorable for him.

134
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,970
Nakazato's R32 was monstrous.

135
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:53,070
And the duct tape death match
was Takumi's first try.

136
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,640
But Takumi always had one friend...

137
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,480
Akina Pass.

138
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,220
The pass that he drove every day for years.

139
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,120
Does the location make that
much difference, though?

140
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,790
If he had driven here a few times,

141
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,250
it might have been different,
but this is his very first time here.

142
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,970
<i>Well, but...</i>

143
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,970
By the way, Iketani...

144
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:31,910
What the heck was that girl
doing sitting next to Mako?

145
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,950
How should I know?

146
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,750
I noticed that, too.

147
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:41,420
This is a race, but she
went in as if it was normal.

148
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,430
I don't know the details.

149
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,330
All I know is that they're best friends,

150
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:51,170
and from the beginning,
they were always analyzing

151
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,930
and developing their technique together.

152
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,180
Isn't she like a rally navigator?

153
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,820
--That makes it worse for Takumi.
--Yeah.

154
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,050
No way! He won't lose!

155
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,320
But with a good navigator,

156
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,490
Mako can concentrate fully on driving.

157
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,670
Obstacle ahead!

158
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,790
--Avoid it and cut inside!
--Yeah.

159
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,230
<i>He keeps up with our fast pace...</i>

160
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,800
<i>...as if Mako's best isn't fast enough.</i>

161
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,700
<i>He's good!</i>

162
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,970
Mako, C-121 is coming up.

163
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,800
We'll shake him off there!

164
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,940
We'll drift from the very beginning.

165
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,280
Let's show him what we're made of

166
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,450
at Usui's most difficult turn.

167
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,480
Got it. That's right!

168
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,750
I'll show him how drifting should be done!

169
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:57,450
No one else has ever
cleared the turn at full speed.

170
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,180
Are Mako and Sayuki here tonight?

171
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,920
I haven't seen them yet.

172
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,020
I wanna see the Sileighty's drift.

173
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,860
Here at C-121 is the best place for it.

174
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,960
'Cuz it's really hard.

175
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,130
It's the hardest.

176
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,470
You're considered an advanced racer here

177
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,140
if you can drift through this turn.

178
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,310
Advanced in Usui means the best anywhere.

179
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,610
--Yeah.
--If you don't have the
courage to come in fast,

180
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:55,820
you won't have enough
speed to drift to the end.

181
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,850
All the first-timers mess it up.

182
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,160
But some can actually do it, right?

183
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,820
A few.

184
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:08,360
But only Mako's Sileighty
does it at full speed.

185
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,530
I don't know how fast she goes,

186
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,700
but no one else has managed it yet.

187
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,010
Someone is coming down.

188
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,980
Hear that squealing? They're coming in fast!

189
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,820
There!

190
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,650
--The Sileighty!
--It's Mako and Sayuki!

191
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,820
Who's following them?

192
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,720
Are they racing?!

193
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,560
An Eight-Six?!

194
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,410
No cars ahead!

195
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,950
Make it flashy, Mako!

196
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,180
--Yeah!
--Go!

197
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,190
They're in the turn!

198
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:30,280
That fool came into the turn
at the same speed as Mako!

199
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,410
Doesn't he know how difficult C-121 is?!

200
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:37,370
Courage alone won't let him clear the corner!

201
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:48,330
<i>He has guts, following Mako into this corner.</i>

202
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:52,970
<i>But at this speed, there's no turning back.</i>

203
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:57,970
<i>C-121's exit narrows severely.</i>

204
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:03,140
<i>There is only one ideal line to the exit,</i>
<i>though there seem to be others.</i>

205
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,950
Can you find it, your first time on this course?

206
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,710
He couldn't have!

207
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,690
--He cleared it.
--Unbelievable.

208
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,990
Who's that Eight-Six?

209
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:52,990
Could he be... the famous
Eight-Six of Mount Akina?

210
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,290
I have goose bumps!

211
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,830
<i>What just happened?</i>

212
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,470
<i>Four-wheel drift at full speed</i>

213
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,970
<i>is ranked as "Ultra D" difficulty.</i>

214
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:10,480
<i>Even Mako missed the</i>
<i>ideal line by three inches.</i>

215
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,420
<i>But he was right on it.</i>

216
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:29,090
<i>We can't win. We chose a</i>
<i>monster as our opponent.</i>

217
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,720
No! You can't swing that much here!

218
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,290
You couldn't have told me that sooner?

219
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,890
What's wrong? Focus! This isn't like you!

220
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,190
Can't you tell, Mako?

221
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,230
That Eight-Six is unreal.

222
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,300
He's way out of our league.

223
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,240
What happened to your usual stubbornness?

224
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,870
It's not even over and you're giving up?

225
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,080
Not me!

226
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,740
I guess I am...

227
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,980
Fine! I didn't know you were a quitter.

228
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,380
I'll do it myself!

229
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,960
We already knew how great he was.

230
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,560
But since this is my last race...

231
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,970
...we can't quit without giving it our best!

232
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,640
What are you, scared?!

233
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,810
You're useless!

234
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:51,680
You're nothing but dead weight.

235
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,610
--Dead weight?!
--You're freight,

236
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,480
messing up the power-to-weight ratio!

237
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,490
<i>She gets tough behind the wheel!</i>

238
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,850
I'm not freight!

239
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:04,160
I'm not fat! I have a nice body!

240
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,630
Forty-nine kilograms of extra weight!

241
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,990
I weigh 47!

242
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,630
Fine, I've got my pride, too!

243
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,540
Ready, Mako?

244
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,540
We'll put our lives on the line!

245
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,440
Welcome back!

246
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,210
All right. Enter the next turn so
you almost scrape the inside wall!

247
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,440
Got it!

248
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,630
<i>Not bad.</i>

249
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:53,160
<i>I improved while recklessly chasing her.</i>

250
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,150
<i>I can feel the rhythm now!</i>

251
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,310
<i>I'm synched in!</i>

252
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,490
<i>Not many corners left now...</i>

253
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:12,230
<i>I'll just have to attack</i>
<i>each corner as well as I can!</i>

254
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,560
<i>I want no regrets.</i>

255
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,000
<i>My pride as Usui's fastest is on the line.</i>

256
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:40,350
<i>Ai ni tsukare hate samayotteta koro</i>

257
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:48,200
<i>Yokubou dake ni kararete miushinatteita</i>

258
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,600
<i>Kimagure na unmei wa</i>

259
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:02,240
<i>Mujaki na hitomi ni miserarete yuku</i>

260
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:10,150
<i>Sake bara no you ni akaku</i>
<i>tsuyoku, tsuyoku kimi o daite</i>

261
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:16,960
<i>Tatta hitotsu kono omoi o shinjitsu da to ieru</i>

262
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,130
<i>Yorokobi o kanadeyou...</i>

00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:29,230
<i>Kagayaku mirai e</i>

00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:48,860
<i>Kazoe kirenai hodo tashikame aou</i>

<i>Jounetsu yo eien e todoke</i>

<i>Sake bara no you ni akaku</i>
<i>tsuyoku, tsuyoku dakishimete</i>

<i>Tatoe nani o ushinattemo</i>
<i>kono ude o hanasanai</i>

00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,680
<i>Utsukushiku karen ni sake...</i>

269
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:20,050
<i>Kiseki no hana yo</i>

270
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:30,500
<i>Bunta, do you think Takumi has</i>
<i>a chance against the Sileighty?</i>

271
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500
<i>--Who knows?</i>
<i>--Who knows?!</i>

272
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,640
<i>I sell tofu, not predictions.</i>

273
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,170
<i>--I'll have Gunmo and Atsuage.</i>
<i>--I have seasoned that Eight-Six.</i>

274
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,710
<i>No one can touch it downhill.</i>

275
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,480
<i>It's up to the driver.</i>

276
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,580
<i>We'll see next week.</i>

277
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,320
<i>What if I bought Momen and Kinugoshi, too?</i>

278
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,320
<i>Next on Initial D: "Super Drift."</i>

279
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,190
<i>--It's a must-see.</i>
<i>--Don't miss it!</i>
