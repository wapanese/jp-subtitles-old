Wataru hasn't gotten any better.

--Yeah.
--Here they come!

34
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,860
--Crap!
--Clear the road!

35
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,390
Hurry! They're here!

36
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,400
Watch and learn from the best!

37
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,810
That's awesome!

38
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,080
No one else can drive like that.

39
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,360
Go ahead and pass it.

40
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,690
An oncoming car at the turn's exit! Go wide!

41
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,320
It's clear!

42
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,830
Leave three inches. It's sandy!

43
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,010
Exactly! You're looking sharp!

44
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,710
No one can touch you now!

46
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,960
What?!

47
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,300
No way!

48
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,270
A girl you just met gave
you her phone number?!

49
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,740
Am I supposed to believe that?

50
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,210
What's the catch, really?

51
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,210
Really, Iketani!

52
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,740
The world isn't that simple!

53
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:40,740
I, uh, I...

54
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,720
Racers don't need girls!

55
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,790
Besides, if there's no catch, it's not like you.

56
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,660
What do you mean by that, Kenji?

57
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,660
Are you putting me down?

58
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,970
No, but it sounds too good to be true.

59
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:06,640
I hate seeing you jealous of my happiness.

60
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,080
Her long brown hair waving in the wind

61
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,120
and her seductive eyes glancing at me.

62
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,120
I'm positive God sent me this beautiful angel

63
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,490
because I'm an honest, hardworking man!

64
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,930
I'm off to Karuizawa tomorrow to see Mako.

65
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,870
Well, back to work!

66
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,370
Hey, why don't we follow
him and check her out?

67
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,710
Good idea!

68
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,940
I wanna see her with my own eyes.

69
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,280
But what if Iketani finds out?

70
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,880
Don't worry!

71
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,450
He's lost in a fantasy world right now.

72
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,860
Let's go see what she really looks like,

73
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,190
this angelic Mako.

74
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,860
Hey, leave Iketani alone.

75
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,700
We won't bother him.

76
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,870
When she dumps him, we'll cry with him.

77
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,630
That's friendship!

78
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,230
When she dumps him?

79
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,530
I doubt she's as pretty as he says she is.

80
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,830
He exaggerates everything.

81
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,000
--He gets obsessed, too.
--Right.

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,170
I think we were in junior high

83
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,510
when we went fishing at Akina Lake.

84
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,210
The fish weren't biting,

85
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,850
but I managed to catch a
small one right before we left.

86
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,180
He was, like, "Wow, it's huge!"

87
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,190
He went crazy.

88
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,290
It was this big.

89
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,620
People came to take a look at it.

90
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,800
I was so embarrassed.

91
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,730
He exaggerates. That's how he is.

92
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,430
Kenji, look to your left.

93
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,370
Crap!

94
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,380
I was lost in the story and
didn't realize I'd sped up.

95
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,380
So much for tailing him.

96
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,880
Sorry, Iketani!

97
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,380
Forgive us!

98
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,290
We just wanted to see what she looked like.

99
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,790
Seriously!

100
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,720
We had no intention of bothering you two.

101
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,160
Don't be mad, okay?

102
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,460
We'll turn around at the next interchange.

103
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,770
Oh, man. You don't have to go home.

104
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,170
I don't mind introducing you to her.

105
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,170
--You sure?
--All right!

106
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,840
But...

107
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,980
...don't follow us after that,

108
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,810
or I'll be really mad!

109
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,610
Cool!

110
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,280
Anyway...

111
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,150
...these are my friends.

112
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,350
Hi, I'm Mako Sato.

113
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,300
--Hi...
--Hello.

114
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,960
--Shall we, Mako?
--Yeah.

115
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,940
Shoo, shoo!

116
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,940
We're not dogs.

117
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,820
This isn't a dream.

118
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,690
Unbelievable.

119
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:50,360
It's shocking to see Iketani
with such a pretty girl...

120
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,700
Racers don't need girls.

121
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,340
Let's cry together, Kenji.

122
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,370
What?

123
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,170
Are you saying that I can't find a girlfriend?!

124
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,970
It's just a joke!

125
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:06,910
What should we do now?

126
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,820
Well, during this season,

127
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:16,160
Karuizawa isn't the place
for three guys to hang out.

128
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,590
Shall we go to Usui Pass?

129
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,050
Sorry...

130
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,780
So, what kind of cars do you like?

131
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,520
I liked, uh...

132
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,420
I admired the last generation RX-7.

133
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,130
An FC!

134
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,620
Hey, you have good taste.

135
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,970
You're a racer, aren't you?

136
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,800
Oh, um, is it that obvious?

137
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,970
Normally, I try to drive like everyone else.

138
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:15,620
So, Mako, what do you think of street racers?

139
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,090
They're okay. I like cars myself.

140
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,620
You do?!

141
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,420
Street racers usually have

142
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,260
better skills than normal drivers.

143
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,300
You can buy expensive cars with money,

144
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,270
but you can't buy technique.

145
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:35,970
I have much more respect for
those with good driving technique

146
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:41,980
than for those with fancy imports.

147
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,110
<i>She's a good girl... an ideal girl!</i>

148
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,290
So, this is Usui Pass.

149
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,630
I've never been here,

150
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,030
but it's much curvier than I had imagined.

151
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,130
It looks tough.

152
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,370
One corner after another,
and the road is narrow.

153
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,270
It doesn't look anything like Akina Pass.

154
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:17,540
I wonder who the fastest is here at Usui Pass?

155
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,650
Um, Iketani?

156
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,220
Yes?

157
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,720
How would you feel about a girl
who liked to drive the passes

158
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,220
and acted like a street racer?

159
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,730
--A Sileighty?!
--Yes.

160
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,500
They say a blue Sileighty is the fastest now.

161
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,370
And surprisingly, its driver is a woman.

162
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,370
A woman?!

163
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:53,310
--A female racer...
--Yes...

164
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,820
I'm totally okay with it, really.

165
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,990
As a matter of fact, I'd feel more
comfortable if she were a racer.

166
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,250
--Really?
--Yeah.

167
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,260
<i>Now I get it.</i>

168
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,900
<i>She wants to be a racer,</i>

169
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,330
<i>which is why she likes an FC.</i>

170
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,840
A Sileighty with a woman driver.

171
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,010
A Sileighty...?

172
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,610
--Is that an import?
--No.

173
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,250
It's a 180 with a Silvia front end on it.

174
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,510
Silvia and 180, so "Sileighty."

175
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,220
Its driver is the fastest at Usui Pass,

176
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,220
and is a woman.

177
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,230
I gotta see that!

178
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,860
You can see her there at night, usually.

179
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,370
It's not wise to challenge her, though.

180
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,460
No locals even come close to her.

181
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,920
It's called Akina Speed Stars.

182
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,490
I built the team.

183
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,630
We have a young racer who they say

184
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,600
is the fastest at Akina Pass.

185
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,470
Speed-wise, I'd say I'm right behind him.

186
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,640
What's wrong, Mako?

187
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,970
No, it's nothing.

188
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:28,640
Sorry, I must be boring you with my car talk.

189
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,950
No, it's not that.

190
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,580
I love cars, too, so it's fun.

191
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,580
Really? I'm glad.

192
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:45,260
So, do you also admire great
drifting skills and all that?

193
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,430
Sure.

194
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,860
You need a lot of experience, like I have,

195
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,530
to use that technique, though.

196
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:54,440
It's dangerous.

197
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,040
So, you're good at drifting?

198
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,670
--Sure.
--I'm happy for you!

199
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,870
Yeah?

200
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:13,350
Thank you for a wonderful day.

201
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,830
--So, Mako...
--Yes?

202
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,530
Well, I'm wondering if you have...

203
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,170
...you know, someone...

204
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,730
...you're seeing right now.

205
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,700
I don't have a boyfriend.

206
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,510
So, call me again, Iketani.

207
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,380
<i>Wow!</i>

208
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,890
Can you hear me, Iketani?

209
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,920
Wake up, Iketani.

210
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,530
Um, I'm...

211
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,230
Why are you here?!

212
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:04,340
We couldn't go back, 'cause
we were worried about you.

213
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,430
So, how did it go?

214
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,610
Today was a fine day, indeed.

215
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,620
You hungry? Dinner's on me!

216
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,690
We can also check out

217
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,560
the racers at Usui Pass.

218
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,590
It sounds like it went well.

219
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:27,690
I guess miracles do happen.

220
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,970
--Wow!
--They're good.

221
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,060
Every driver here has good skills.

222
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,310
Hey, Takumi?

223
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,880
You've never been to other passes, right?

224
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,210
How was it?

225
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:49,880
Well, I mean, I wasn't the one driving,

226
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,720
so I really can't say.

227
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,660
Are you sure? Your eyes were pretty serious.

228
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,460
Yeah?

229
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,790
They look totally different now,

230
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,960
as if you're a different person.

231
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,800
Could you race here?

232
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,300
I wouldn't know until I tried it.

233
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,930
--There!
--The Sileighty?!

234
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:22,480
--Continuous reverse drift!
--What the...?!

235
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,650
<i>She's good!</i>

236
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,490
--Did you see that?
--The narrow road made it intense!

237
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,700
<i>I told Mako that I was good at drifting,</i>

238
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,970
<i>but I still panic when the rear slides out.</i>

239
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,340
<i>I seriously have to work at it,</i>

240
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,470
<i>or I'll lose my angel!</i>

241
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,540
--Let's head down.
--Yeah, okay.

242
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,040
Every pass has a great racer.

243
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,330
He's going pretty fast, isn't he?

244
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,330
We got three people here.

245
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,800
I can't keep up.

246
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,230
We'd better give him some room.

247
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,140
He seems out of sync,

248
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,540
and his car's acting weird.

249
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,710
How can you tell?

250
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:25,010
I'm not positive, but that's
probably what's going on.

251
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,740
Probably?

252
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,360
He spun out!

253
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,550
Takumi was right.

254
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,260
Crap! A car's coming!

255
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,710
That was close!

256
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,340
Who is this idiot?!

257
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,780
As the rear slides out, he panics
and spins out of control.

258
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,920
It's a beginner's mistake.

259
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,080
Hey, S13!

260
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:08,190
Move out of the way, or you'll
put other drivers in danger!

261
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,090
I'm moving...

262
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,460
That's so embarrassing!

263
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,450
Let's act like we don't know him.

264
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,760
Sorry about that...

265
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,080
What's wrong?

266
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,050
Nothing.

267
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:55,230
<i>So, it's Mako whose Sileighty</i>
<i>is the fastest at Usui Pass.</i>

268
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,960
<i>I wanna die!</i>

269
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,680
--A day off?
--He hasn't called, either.

270
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:11,090
This is very rare for a workaholic like Iketani.

271
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,350
He must've taken it real hard.

272
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:18,190
He didn't say a word after
what happened last night.

273
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,260
At a rest area on the way back,

274
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,700
his eyes were dull from shock.

275
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,470
I felt too bad to say anything to him.

276
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,140
I had a bad feeling about this.

277
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,340
She was too cute to be his girlfriend.

278
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,380
Like I said, racers don't need girls.

279
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,510
Itsuki the Lonely Driver... that's my title.

280
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,970
I hope he'll snap out of it soon.

281
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,860
Telephone, Koichiro!

282
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,500
Tell them I'm sleeping...

283
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,500
It's probably Kenji.

284
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,530
It's a girl named Mako Sato!

285
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,820
Did you want to talk to me?

286
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,250
Yeah...

287
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,020
If you're here to make fun of me, please don't.

288
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,360
No, I'm not here to make fun of you.

289
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,350
I never suspected it was you.

290
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:36,500
I saw your Sileighty drift
through the narrow road.

291
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,940
The fastest at Usui Pass...

292
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,450
You could've warned me about that.

293
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,110
I'm sorry.

294
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,620
I've never told anyone about this.

295
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,850
It was shocking to me, too,

296
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:56,020
and I realized that I owed you the truth.

297
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,120
The truth?

298
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,700
I'm really the quiet type.

299
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,130
It's hard to believe that a quiet type

300
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,900
could drift that dynamically.

301
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:16,040
I'm one of those people whose
character changes behind the wheel.

302
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,250
No matter how fast I drive,

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,880
men don't see me as girlfriend material,

304
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:27,050
so I've decided to put an end to this.

305
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,580
I'm quitting racing after this summer.

306
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,130
To make this summer memorable,

307
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,930
I would like to race
Akina's Eight-Six at Usui Pass.

308
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,570
Wha...?

309
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,570
That's my wish.

310
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,970
In return for my wish...

311
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:50,570
...I'll give you my virginity.

312
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,750
Wait a minute! That's nonsense!

313
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,520
--Am I not good enough?
--That's not it.

314
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,820
He's my friend,

315
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,120
so I can't sell him out like that.

316
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,530
<i>I get it now.</i>

317
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,660
<i>Her true intention...</i>

318
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,830
<i>...was not me, but Takumi.</i>

319
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,670
<i>Otherwise, a pretty girl like her</i>

320
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:18,500
<i>wouldn't be interested in someone like me.</i>

321
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,540
I understand.

322
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,550
I'll do what I can.

323
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:30,050
--Really?
--Don't get me wrong, though.

324
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:34,660
I'm not doing this
because of your proposition.

325
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,160
Iketani...

326
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,960
I just want to make your wish come true.

327
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,210
<i>It's okay...</i>

328
00:21:54,210 --> 00:22:00,250
<i>...because for a short while,</i>
<i>I was falling for her.</i>

329
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,150
<i>I just want her to be happy.</i>

330
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,260
<i>I'd probably be laughed at for this,</i>

331
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,700
<i>but I really liked her.</i>

332
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,070
<i>I loved her...</i>

333
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,330
<i>...even though I was mistaken.</i>

334
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:40,350

<i>Mako, how can you be interested in Iketani?</i>

349
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,000
<i>I don't know...</i>

350
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,470
<i>And you made that big proposition.</i>

351
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:37,070
<i>Maybe that was a little too much...</i>

352
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,310
<i>There're tons of good-looking guys,</i>

353
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,740
<i>so why Iketani?!</i>

354
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,080
<i>But I kind of like him...</i>

355
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,980
<i>--I really don't get it!</i>
<i>--Shush!</i>

356
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,520
