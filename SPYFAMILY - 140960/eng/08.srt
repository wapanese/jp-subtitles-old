1
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,700
Now, who can answer this question?

2
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,990
Miss Anya Forger.

3
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,990
Three-thirds!

4
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,490
Ah. That is quite wrong.

5
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,720
So, how are things going, Twilight?

6
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,020
How is your daughter doing
with her academics?

7
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,940
HQ was estimating that she'd be able to
receive eight Stella in about four months.

8
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,160
Four...

9
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,260
Not a problem.

10
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,020
I see... that your ability
to lie has diminished.

11
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,720
I'm confident she'll be able to get eight
Tonitrus Bolts in two months, though.

12
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,850
No matter.

13
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:21,540
By the way...

14
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,930
Our informant within city hall
was compromised this morning.

15
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,740
The enemy is stepping up their game.

16
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,720
Be on your guard, Twilight.

17
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,530
I shouldn't have to say this
about being in the city,

18
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,160
but be it at Eden College or elsewhere,

19
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,260
you never know where eyes
will be watching you.

20
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,750
This country's counter-intelligence
agency is quite tough.

21
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,760
H-How can I help you gentlemen?

22
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,270
We're with the State Security Service.

23
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,650
You're Jim Hayward, are you not?

24
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,320
We're taking you in on
suspicion of being a spy.

25
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,240
A s-spy?! What are you talking about?

26
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,270
Hey... wait!

27
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,800
Stop that! Unhand me at onc—

28
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,880
We'll hear what you have
to say back at the office.

29
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:19,250
That's totally what happened
this morning! I was <i>so</i> scared!

30
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,840
The guy they took from finance

31
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,920
was apparently leaking
documents from this office.

32
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,210
Oh, he must be a bad person.

33
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,170
Mornin'.

34
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,110
Oh, mornin'!

35
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,990
Good morning, Camilla.

36
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,710
Oh, by the way, Yor, my boyfriend
told me about your marriage.

37
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,910
You haven't even told your
younger brother yet?

38
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,300
Oh, you're right! I'd completely forgotten!

39
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,010
Uh, you forgot? For a whole year?

40
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,860
Wh-What shall I do?

41
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,830
He said he'll be calling you here later.

42
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,340
That's right.

43
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,370
I haven't given him the
number for my new place yet.

44
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,330
I was so relieved our marriage went through
that I blanked on everything else!

45
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,330
Say... is your younger brother a hottie?

46
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,830
Aw, he's a total cutie!

47
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,990
Yes. Yuri is quite adorable.

48
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:12,700
He would always call me "Sis"
and refused to leave my side.

49
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,980
Yikes, so he's obsessed with his sister. Pass.

50
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:19,820
If your brother looks up to you so much,
isn't it kinda mean to forget to tell him that?

51
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,730
Let's start one more time
from the beginning.

52
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,270
How many and what kind of files
did you take from city hall?

53
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,760
Who did you sell them to?

54
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,920
What do they look like?
What is their contact information?

55
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,470
When, where, and how many
times did you meet with them?

56
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,840
Please let me go home.

57
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,830
The State Security Service.

58
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,730
An organization whose goal is to maintain
the peace within their nation.

59
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,300
Its main duties include spy hunting
and keeping an eye on the citizens.

60
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,150
To complete their missions,
they frequently use violence,

61
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,820
wiretapping, intimidation, and torture.

62
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,640
The citizens called them the
"secret police," and they are feared.

63
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,390
Great work, First Lieutenant. The boss
asked me to take over the questioning.

64
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,370
All right. I'll leave the rest to you,

65
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,080
Second Lieutenant Briar.

66
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,700
Yes, sir! I'll do my best!

67
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,840
Yuri Briar, age twenty.

68
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,250
He is a member of the secret police.

69
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,030
Why did the boss bring
such a softie into our team?

70
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,840
I admit that he's good,
but frankly, he's just a kid.

71
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,990
Some elite from the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs who quickly rose up the ranks.

72
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,710
When I talked to the boss...

73
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,930
Huh? Well, isn't Yuri adorable?

74
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,720
He's like some cute little puppy.

75
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,350
And that was all.

76
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,220
I-I see...

77
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,230
Well, our organization needs
a kid like him sometimes.

78
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,900
Not to mention, he knows how to do the job,

79
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,960
and he can be quite indiscriminate.

80
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,460
Hello, Mr. Hayward!

81
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,870
You won't get anything out of m—

82
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,080
My older sister actually works
at city hall just like you do!

83
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,090
Huh?

84
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:57,110
Maybe you know her. She's pretty
and kind, and I'm super proud of her!

85
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,930
I'm actually going to celebrate
her marriage today.

86
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,450
I haven't seen her in forever,
so I'm really excited!

87
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,900
So, yeah. I'd like to get this over
with quickly so I can go home.

88
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,970
Why don't you just spit it all out already?

89
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,210
I-I don't know anything!

90
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,310
Here are photos of your deals.

91
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,570
This is you, isn't it, Mr. Hayward?

92
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,160
Second Lieutenant, you—

93
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,680
How long were you holding on to
important evidence like this?!

94
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,440
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot to submit them.

95
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,010
You'd be much better off if you were honest.

96
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,830
So, I was just giving them the
papers in exchange for cash.

97
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:41,170
All I know about him is that he's from
the West. I don't even know his name.

98
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:45,620
Was there anything awkward about
this man's looks or speech?

99
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,290
Perhaps he didn't act his age?

100
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,850
No, nothing like that.

101
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,290
I see. In that case...

102
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,350
Does the name "Twilight"
sound familiar to you?

103
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,430
Who?

104
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,850
He's a spy from the West.
Apparently, a master of disguise.

105
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,720
He is the villain who is trying
to make this world fall into chaos.

106
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,780
You could call him my natural enemy.

107
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,210
I-If I helped you catch him,
could we just forget about all this?

108
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,040
Do you know something?

109
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,070
Er, no, but let me remember...

110
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,340
If you feed me false information, you'll be
committing another crime, so do be careful.

111
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,670
I just wanted extra money so I could fool
around with girls! I didn't mean any harm.

112
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,800
You have a wife, don't you?

113
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,230
You're a man, too! You must understand!

114
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,670
I was just selling some documents.
I'm no political criminal.

115
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,670
Let me off the hook! Please!

116
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,950
Mr. Hayward, you see...

117
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,200
I haven't told my sister that I work
for the State Security Service.

118
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,700
It's a particularly dangerous job,
so it'd just worry her.

119
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:53,640
And above all, I don't want her
to know how much dirty work I do.

120
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,730
Mr. Hayward, what you've done is treason.

121
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,680
Perhaps they were nothing more
than pieces of paper to you,

122
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,020
but they may very well put many
of our citizens in danger.

123
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,300
Do you understand?!

124
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,900
Unlike you, I love my family... my sister.

125
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,730
I will do anything to protect this
country where my sister lives.

126
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,450
And I do mean anything.

127
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,760
I don't care how much you torture me!

128
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,880
I will never... sell out my friends!

129
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,540
Curse you and your resilience, Bondman!

130
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,040
If only she could concentrate
on her studies like this.

131
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,880
I only have two bullets left.

132
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,830
How many bullets can Bondman's pistol hold?

133
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:44,040
Hm? I'm pretty sure it was eight.

134
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,540
So that's two-eighths!

135
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,650
Yes! You're right!

136
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,800
He has two-eighths of his bullets left!

137
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,420
How do you even know those words?

138
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,360
So the cartoon makes things
easier for her to understand?

139
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,920
Th-Th-Th-Th-There's trouble, Loid!

140
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,580
Welcome home, Yor.

141
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,810
He has two-eighths of his bullets left!

142
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,700
Yuri... I mean, my younger brother
is coming here today!

143
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,580
Today?!

144
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,900
So, yes...

145
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,500
He insists on coming over
and congratulating us.

146
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,410
What shall we do? He won't find out
that this marriage is fake, will he?

147
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,150
Don't worry.

148
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,420
I've prepared lovey-dovey couple
accessories for just this sort of occasion.

149
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,880
Papa and Mama are flirting.

150
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,270
We are not!

151
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,890
Mama's little brother still isn't here?

152
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,320
You mean your uncle.

153
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,010
Unkie...

154
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,730
It's late. You should go to bed.

155
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,520
Anya will greet Unkie, too...

156
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,520
It appears as though he's
still stuck at work.

157
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,900
I got a little worked up, and now I'm late.

158
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,900
Ah, but...

159
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,430
I'll finally be able to see Sis!
It's been so long! La, la!

160
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,410
Hurgh!

161
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,170
I can feel the ribs that my
sister broke before tingling.

162
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,880
I'm remembering her loving embrace,
and now my whole body is tingling!

163
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:23,980
But why in the world did my sister wait
a whole year to tell me she was married?

164
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,890
Could he be some foul villain that
she's afraid of introducing to me?!

165
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:35,280
I will eliminate every threat within
this country where my sister lives.

166
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,640
That includes her husband, too.

167
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,690
Loid Forger...

168
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,810
If he's some shithead who's threatening my
sister, I'll throw him in a cell immediately.

169
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,650
No, calm down. She mustn't
find out about my job.

170
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,580
In order to protect my
job and my happiness,

171
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,670
I must make sure she never
finds out about this!

172
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,680
Yuri Briar...

173
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,490
The Forgers' only blood relative.

174
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,370
It's easy to slip up around someone you're
emotionally close to. We must be careful.

175
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,320
I cannot lose this family that
I've worked so hard to create.

176
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,930
Everyone has a side they
don't show anyone else.

177
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:17,440
To their friends, their significant others,
or even their families.

178
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,460
They hide what they're truly feeling
through fake smiles or bravado,

179
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,460
and keep their true identities secret.

180
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:30,320
That is how the world keeps up
the appearance of its temporary peace.

181
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:38,130
Foreign Minister Windsor met with Westalis's
Foreign Minister Brantz for six days of talks,

182
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,210
with the goal of normalizing diplomatic
relations between the two countries.

183
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,500
- I'm going to find out...
- I'm going to find out...

184
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,330
- if this man is going to harm our family or not!
-  if this man is worthy of my sister or not!

185
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,720
No, of course he's not worthy.

186
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,880
Oh, let me take your coat
and the things you're carrying.

187
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,910
Oh, no, there's no need.
Thank you for offering.

188
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,730
I can prepare something simple
for us to eat pretty quickly.

189
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,740
The two of you can go ahead and relax.

190
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,940
Oh, don't mind me.

191
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,160
I would never eat something you've made.

192
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,450
Oh, you look so scary, Yuri.
You must be nervous.

193
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,990
I-I'm not...

194
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,830
Crap. My animosity must've been showing.

195
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,500
I could still be worked up from
that interrogation earlier.

196
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,960
I need to play the part of the studious
civil servant in front of my sister!

197
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:25,510
I could never tell him that I got
married so I could continue killing!

198
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,010
Thank you for the flowers, Yuri.

199
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,720
Sure... But, Sis...

200
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,550
I haven't accepted your marriage yet.

201
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,880
Why did you keep this a secret for a year?

202
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,520
How am I supposed to accept
it if you don't explain?

203
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,270
A reasonable question.

204
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,390
Now, then...

205
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:49,280
About your brother... Why don't we just
go ahead and tell him everything?

206
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,760
The fact that single women are
seen as highly suspicious

207
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,450
is a very serious issue in our times.

208
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,970
I'm sure your brother will understand.

209
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,590
W-We can't!

210
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,870
My brother can be very, er, sensitive.

211
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:08,110
If he found out that I... I got married
to someone I wasn't in love with,

212
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,940
he would probably lose his composure.

213
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,310
Then we could end up troubling you, Loid...

214
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,550
And I don't want my brother to have to
worry about me over something like this.

215
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:24,750
Oh, b-but don't worry! I have the
perfect excuse to give him!

216
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,810
I know more about Yuri than
anyone else, so leave this to me!

217
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,330
I'm counting on you, Yor.

218
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,580
Well, Sis? Why didn't you tell me?

219
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,580
W-Well...

220
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,580
B-Because I completely forgot!

221
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,290
Huh? Okay, uh, I...

222
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,580
It completely slipped my mind!

223
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,170
Actually, when I called you the other day,
you told me that you had a partner.

224
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,420
You could've at least told me then!

225
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,590
W-Well...

226
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,470
I forgot that I had forgotten to
tell you about my marriage!

227
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,260
Well, if you say so,
it must be true! Sorry, Sis.

228
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,470
He accepted that?!

229
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,500
When it concerns his sister, this man's
sense of logic goes out the window.

230
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,160
Jeez, Sis! You're such a scatterbrain!

231
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,490
Is this normal for the Briars?

232
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,420
Sorry to keep you waiting.

233
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,000
Tch. How dare you interrupt
the fun Sis and I were having?

234
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:27,020
No... If I keep up this nasty attitude,
Sis might end up hating me.

235
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,000
I need to at least fake—

236
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,710
Isn't Loid's cooking just so delicious?

237
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:37,820
Hmph! Don't think your cooking is
enough to win me over, you villain!

238
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,050
Oh, right. I actually
brought over some wine.

239
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,030
Please, help yourselves.

240
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,670
How considerate of you.

241
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,080
I'll get you drunk and expose you
for the filthy villain you are!

242
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,270
None for you tonight, Yor.

243
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,470
I know.

244
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,570
Unfortunately.

245
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,640
So where did you two meet?

246
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,580
At the boutique on 3rd Street.

247
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,810
It was so surprising for a man I didn't
know to stare at me like that.

248
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,050
Er, well... She was just
so beautiful, you know...

249
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,090
The way you said that...

250
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:11,340
This subject will probably lead to
a slip-up. I need to change it.

251
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,090
After a few dinners, we realized
we had a lot in common.

252
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,900
When were these dinners? Where?
How many times did you go?

253
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,600
Which restaurants?

254
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,660
How many encounters led to your courtship?

255
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,080
What made you decide to marry her?

256
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,280
Um...

257
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,110
Why do I feel like I'm being
questioned by an officer?

258
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,870
How do the two of you address each other?

259
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,630
Huh? Er, I call her "Yor."

260
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,630
"Yor"?!

261
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,370
Even I hesitate to use her given name!

262
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,660
S-S-S-Sis, you don't happen to call him
"Loi Loi" or "Loidy," do you?

263
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,330
Huh? Um...

264
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,210
Loidy!

265
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,740
God damn it!

266
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,920
I-I just... call him Loid!

267
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,470
When it concerns his sister, this man's
sense of logic... Well, you know the rest.

268
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,760
Are you all right?

269
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,430
Here, have some water.

270
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,880
What could my sister possibly
like about this guy?!

271
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,910
Just because he can cook a little,
and he's handsome, and tall,

272
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,200
and considerate, and a
doctor, that's just...

273
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,130
That's just...

274
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,170
God damn it!

275
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,930
Yuri, calm down.

276
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,210
I guess neither Briar
holds their liquor well.

277
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,450
By the way, Yuri, I hear you're a diplomat.

278
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,700
Divert, divert...

279
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,610
That's quite the line of work.
Yor loves to brag about you all the time.

280
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:32,850
Dominic told me the other day that you
went all the way to Hugaria recently.

281
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,730
Huh? Yeah. I mean, it's just work.

282
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,440
But yes. It was a beautiful city.

283
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,520
I wish I could've shown you, Sis.

284
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,170
There were a lot of cafés, too.

285
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,140
There was even an old one that
an empress used to frequent...

286
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,530
You mean in the capital city Obda, right?

287
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,760
There are several delicious
restaurants there.

288
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,360
I went there when I was a medical student.

289
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,170
Oh, really?

290
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,990
I went to Kalpatia often.

291
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,760
The old man who owns it makes a superb stew.

292
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,170
I had that, too! Ah...

293
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,910
So this wine is also from
Hugaria. It's excellent.

294
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:09,870
This is...

295
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,270
Oh, that...

296
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,170
"I bought it from a shop on Hedger Street."

297
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,180
I found it at a little
shop on Hedger Street.

298
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,180
It must've been pricey.

299
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,860
It's 200 dalc.

300
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,680
Oh, no. It was just around 200 dalc.

301
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,330
I knew it.

302
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,680
That's plenty fancy. Thank you very much.

303
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,250
This conversation...

304
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:35,200
It's right out of the Ostanian Intelligence
Agency's manual for the art of deception.

305
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,780
It's a conversation template used to fabricate
a story about going to another country.

306
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,960
Meaning this whole story's been a lie.

307
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,460
Besides, the owner of Kalpatia
now has his son running the shop.

308
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,590
And this wine actually costs 300 dalc
now due to a poor harvest.

309
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,710
You may be able to fool an amateur,
but it won't work on me,

310
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,350
Yuri Briar!

311
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,700
I had my reservations as soon as I heard you
worked for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

312
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,210
That line of work has commonly
been an entryway to espionage.

313
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,760
I had Franky do some digging,

314
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,430
and there are records showing he worked
in that department up until a year ago.

315
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,600
He must've been scouted by the intelligence
agency right before or after that.

316
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,900
Putting all the pieces together,

317
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,830
this man works for the domestic
counter-intelligence agency

318
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,580
that is WISE's mortal enemy...
the secret police!

319
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,010
That said, though it may be dangerous,

320
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,290
as long as he doesn't find
out who I really am,

321
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,750
maintaining this relationship
isn't a bad idea.

322
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,430
If I play my cards right, he could
be a powerful source of information

323
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,740
regarding my enemies.

324
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,760
I'll get you something in return next time.

325
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,320
Isn't it wonderful that you have such
a lovely older brother now, Yuri?

326
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,270
He appears to be concealing
his identity from Yor, too.

327
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,210
He may be easier to
manipulate than I thought.

328
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,760
Yuri?

329
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,800
I told you I wouldn't accept him, Sis!

330
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,360
I'm never going to call him my brother!

331
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,030
You're being rude, Yuri.

332
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,020
Yeah, you're right.

333
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,470
I went out into the world,
made a name for myself,

334
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,420
and I can even buy expensive booze now!

335
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,040
But that's all because of my sister!

336
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,700
Our parents were gone, and we were poor,

337
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,400
so we couldn't even get everything
I'd need for studying.

338
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,350
But...

339
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:11,360
Sis sure is late. She's still
at her part-time job?

340
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,260
I'm home, Yuri!

341
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,500
Uh, Sis?!

342
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,780
What happened?! You're covered in blood!

343
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,790
What kind of work were you doing?!

344
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,890
Huh? Oh, I'm totally fine.

345
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,510
This isn't my blood, so...

346
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,270
More importantly, look, Yuri!

347
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,930
Ta-da! It's the encyclopedia
set you wanted!

348
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:34,040
I got paid a lot this time,
so I went ahead and bought it!

349
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,220
Sis...

350
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,770
Sis would always work
herself to death for me!

351
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,290
So I made up my mind... that I was
going to become a proper adult,

352
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,690
and be a man who could protect my sister.

353
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:52,050
I'm going to be the one who protects
my one and only family member.

354
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,910
Can you even imagine

355
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,590
how it feels for me to have the
most important person in my life

356
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,800
just suddenly taken from me by some
guy who appeared out of thin air?

357
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,310
Yuri...

358
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:06,730
Sure, I wanted you to get married
someday and find true happiness.

359
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:11,310
But that guy has to be someone who
could protect you even better than me!

360
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,310
Are you saying you're up to that task,

361
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,800
Loidy?!

362
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,570
Lo—

363
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,600
I just want to put my
brother's mind at ease.

364
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,610
I...

365
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:27,060
I love Yor as much as you do, if not more!

366
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:31,010
My daughter loves Yor very much, too.

367
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:34,130
Come on... This is just an
act to deceive my brother.

368
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,410
She is already a part of my family.

369
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,120
Even if spears or meteors
rained down from the sky,

370
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,850
I would risk my life to protect her.

371
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,880
This man was a bold liar.

372
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,010
Did he say... meteors?!

373
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:53,390
I'm confident that I could protect
her from spears, but meteors?!

374
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,400
Is he surprisingly powerful?
But how would he do that?

375
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,980
I-It's easy to claim such things, you liar!

376
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,410
Yeah! You have the face of a liar!

377
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,650
Oh, goodness.

378
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,460
You're so careless sometimes, Yuri!

379
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,190
Oh, don't worry about it,
Yor. I'll clean it up.

380
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,470
What? You've been married for a year,

381
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,460
and <i>that's</i> your reaction when your hands touch?

382
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,860
What? Are you actually married?

383
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,650
Wha—

384
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,590
Wh-What are you talking about?
We're so in love.

385
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,170
Y-Yes, exactly.

386
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:34,180
A likely story... If you're really
married, then prove it to me.

387
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,550
I mean, we have our marriage license...

388
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,680
That's not what I meant!

389
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,820
Kiss right here and now.

390
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,190
Huh?!

391
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,300
Should be easy if you're actually in love.

392
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,770
Er... But if it's in front of someone...

393
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,800
Just once is fine. Then I'll believe you.

394
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,760
If you can't, I'm going to city hall to
have them revoke your marriage license!

395
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,750
This is bad. What should I do?

396
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,750
No, calm down.

397
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,970
I'm Westalis's greatest spy, Twilight.

398
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,460
I've had relations with countless
women on my missions.

399
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,260
If a kiss or two will
keep my mission safe...

400
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,800
If that's all it takes...

401
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,770
What?!

402
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,820
Loid, wait...

403
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,770
I'm just going to do what I always do, Yor.

404
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,020
Come on.

405
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,020
I mean, we need to so we can keep
our fake marriage going, but...

406
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:20,530
Wha...

407
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,220
Wha...

408
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:28,630
What?!
