1
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,230
The man who threatens the peace
between the East and the West...

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,240
Donovan Desmond.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,980
In order to get closer to him,

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,860
I successfully had Anya enroll in
Eden College, the school his son attends.

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,870
Next, in order to attend the social
gathering that Desmond goes to,

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,880
I need Anya to obtain eight
merits, called "Stella,"

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,170
so that she can become an Imperial Scholar.

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,010
To make this all happen at a prestigious
school, however, would not be easy.

9
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,600
That is why I formulated a plan B,
"The Friendship Scheme."

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:47,020
I was hoping to have Anya get
closer to Desmond's son, Damian,

11
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,280
which in turn would hopefully
connect us as their parents.

12
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,900
But on the first day,
she ended up punching Damian,

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,110
earned a Tonitrus Bolt, and left
their friendship in shambles.

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,070
Alas, it is too early to give up.

15
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,210
This plan has only just begun.

16
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,180
Good mworning...

17
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,760
Good morning, Yor. Breakfast is ready.

18
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,520
Looks like the three of us are
getting used to life as a family.

19
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,440
Is Anya still asleep?

20
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,570
She's still worried about
what happened yesterday?

21
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,110
Come on out. I won't get mad.

22
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,030
Eat quickly, or you'll be late.

23
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,910
I'm sorry I'm bad at school.

24
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,040
No, that was my fault.

25
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,250
There's no point to worrying about the past.

26
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,960
Just make sure you don't
get into any more fights.

27
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,010
Okay, come on. Cheer up.

28
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,680
Your classes start today.

29
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,930
You're so kind, Loid.

30
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,940
Figuring out what we can do next is far more
constructive than dwelling on the past.

31
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,190
Besides, it would be
much worse if she somehow

32
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,690
got sick of school and
didn't want to go anymore.

33
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,950
I need her school life to go as smoothly
as possible for the sake of this mission.

34
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,120
Oh, and make sure you apologize
to Damian at school today.

35
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,040
Got it?

36
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,120
Yep. Gonna go now.

37
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,710
Do your best and be a good girl!

38
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,860
It's time for us to head to work, too.

39
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,720
Yes.

40
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,630
I'm counting on you, Anya.

41
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,520
The peace of the world rests
on you two making amends.

42
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,940
Anya will do her best.

43
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,530
Have a wonderful day, Miss Becky.

44
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,150
Miss Rich Girl!

45
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,620
Oh, Anya. Good day to you.

46
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,230
Do you live in a castle, Miss Rich Girl?

47
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,580
Of course not.

48
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,120
You came here on the school bus?

49
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,880
I could have my driver give you a ride
to and from school from now on.

50
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,130
Does that mean I get to
be a Miss Rich Girl, too?

51
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,130
I never said anything about adopting you.

52
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,100
Aw, I'm jealous of the dorm kids who
don't have to go to and from school.

53
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,350
Bleh...

54
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,350
What do you mean, "Bleh"?
You rude little girl!

55
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,770
Ugh, it's only morning and
you're already obnoxious.

56
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,270
What's her problem?

57
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,150
Know your place!

58
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,650
Nyah!

59
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,570
Make sure you apologize.

60
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,660
Um...

61
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,910
Um, yesterday, I...

62
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,330
Let's go, Anya. Our class is about to start.

63
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,170
Hey, wait!

64
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,540
You'll just catch their stupid
if you keep talking to them.

65
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,670
But world peace!

66
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,840
Stop getting in the way, Blackbell girl!

67
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,840
No, wait.

68
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,590
As I recall, Blackbell and the Desmond
Group are actually business partners.

69
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,730
Could this girl be under orders from an enemy
organization to put a stop to our mission?

70
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,440
No, calm down. That's not possible.

71
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,490
First impressions are the most important thing
when forming a group of friends at school.

72
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,200
They must make amends today, no matter what.

73
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,460
You know...

74
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,000
Hm.

75
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,250
That's the girl who got violent, right?

76
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,000
How scary! So barbaric.

77
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,590
Is the girl next to her another delinquent?

78
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,050
She just hit him out of nowhere
without a reason, right? That's nuts.

79
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,600
I don't want to be in the same class as her.

80
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,930
What if she hits me, too?

81
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,560
I can't believe she came to
school. Talk about a pain.

82
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,350
School is scary...

83
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,230
People are so shallow.

84
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,820
They can only judge what's on the surface.

85
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,740
Are you a smart person, Rich Girl?

86
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,070
Aw, I wouldn't say that.

87
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,780
And call me Becky, not "Rich Girl."

88
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,330
All right, be seated.

89
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,410
I hope we become the best of friends.

90
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,080
I'm the only one who knows
how good you are, Anya.

91
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,580
Honestly, people like that are just...

92
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,130
We'd better stay away from them.
Honestly, people like that are just...

93
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,130
We'd better stay away from them.

94
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,670
School is scary,
but I think it might be okay.

95
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,800
Hey, look! Isn't this cute?

96
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,220
Tch!

97
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,810
Why don't you give them a piece
of your mind, Lord Damian?

98
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,180
That's right. My name is Damian Desmond.

99
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,310
As one of the sons of a prestigious family,
I was born into a life of privilege.

100
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,400
No one had ever defied me before.

101
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,900
I've never even been hit
by my older brother.

102
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,490
And yet...

103
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,740
Mr. Desmond.

104
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,530
Here.

105
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,780
This is the first time I've
had to deal with such...

106
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,830
With such...

107
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,410
With such...

108
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,250
With such...

109
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,170
Johnny.

110
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:22,830
Here.

111
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,920
Jesse.

112
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,630
Here.

113
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:25,840
Carl.

114
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,670
Here.

115
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,300
Well, today will be our first lesson,

116
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,590
so before we begin...

117
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,720
This is the starting line for all of you who
worked so hard to get into this school...

118
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,850
As you can see in this example,
when this and this are like this...

119
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,980
And that's why this turns out
like this, and this is... this.

120
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,770
So you get this answer by doing this...

121
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,610
And if you get this answer, you can use the
same method to get the answer over here.

122
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,150
She had the nerve to fall asleep
in first period on her first day.

123
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,110
Is she actually a delinquent?

124
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,120
How scary.

125
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,410
Anya!

126
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,330
We have science class next. Wake up!

127
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,910
Second son!

128
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,120
I have to apologize to the second son.

129
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,750
Second son? You mean Damian?

130
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,460
He already left.

131
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,380
And just leave that loser alone.

132
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,720
But peace will be in trouble if
I don't apologize to the second son.

133
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,140
You mean it'll put a damper
on your peaceful school life?

134
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,470
I mean, yeah... Who knows
what that boy will try to do?

135
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,310
But don't worry.

136
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,980
I'm on your side, Anya!

137
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,570
I'll protect you, no matter what.

138
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:31,900
Oh, it's okay, then.

139
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,190
Yes.

140
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,660
No, it's not!

141
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,740
Papa?!

142
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,290
I need a way to tell her how
important that apology is!

143
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,290
As you can see, you can reflect
the sun's rays using a mirror.

144
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,750
The spot where the light hits will feel warm.

145
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,880
Next, let's try an experiment
using two mirrors.

146
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,590
Is that you, God?!

147
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,020
Apologize, Anya. Reconcile with him.

148
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,480
I suddenly feel this intense pressure.

149
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,360
"And that's when John made up his mind.

150
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,650
Even if he were to be left out,
he was going to see his beliefs through.

151
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:18,620
And then John never apologized
to anyone ever again."

152
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,620
My textbook seems different
from everyone else's...

153
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,420
It's finally time for lunch.
Let's go to the cafeteria.

154
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,880
I guess this really is a prestigious school.

155
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,420
We're getting pretty brutal
lessons from day one.

156
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,050
I'm exhausted.

157
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:50,650
New students, you can order
whatever you'd like for lunch.

158
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:54,320
Huh... Well, they're nowhere
near as talented as my chef.

159
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Anya wants omelet rice.

160
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,820
What a bizarre dish.

161
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,710
Second son!

162
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,040
Ew, go eat in your dorm.

163
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,140
I have to apologize.

164
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,340
No, you don't.

165
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,010
They're the ones at fault.

166
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,550
That stupid little brat!

167
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,470
That's it. I need to get her away from Anya.

168
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,890
Hey, newbie! Where are you going?!

169
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,380
Becky Blackbell from Class 1-3.

170
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,310
Come to the student hall in Tower A immediately.

171
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,360
Huh? But I'm still eating.
Come to the student hall in Tower A immediately.

172
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,440
Huh? But I'm still eating.

173
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,290
Now!

174
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,280
Ugh!

175
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,990
Now's my chance to apologize.

176
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,740
Wh-What do you want?! You wanna fight again?

177
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,830
Umâ€”

178
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,720
If you hadn't sucker punched him,
Lord Damian never would've lost to you!

179
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,750
Um...

180
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,400
Shut up, you two.

181
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,510
Huh? I see. You're going to
personally give her what for!

182
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,910
Why do I find it so hard to
speak when she's in front of me?

183
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,120
Lord Damian?

184
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,210
What is this awkward sensation
I'm feeling in my chest?

185
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:23,280
I feel a weird chill. I better
apologize quick, then run away.

186
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,200
Knowing Lord Damian,

187
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,280
I'm sure he's finding the absolute perfect
insults to rip this little girl to shreds!

188
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,540
I wonder what he'll go for? "Shrimp"?

189
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,300
No, that is far too meek.

190
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:36,590
Super uggo? Raccoon face?

191
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,670
Um...
Super uggo? Raccoon face?

192
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,420
Super uggo? Raccoon face?

193
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,670
Violent gorilla girl?

194
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,170
I...
Violent gorilla girl?

195
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:40,800
She's even got those lame hair
things that look like horns.
I...

196
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,590
She's even got those lame hair
things that look like horns.

197
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,300
Y-Yesterday...
She's even got those lame hair
things that look like horns.

198
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,140
Your momma's so fat...
Y-Yesterday...

199
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,330
Your momma's so fat...

200
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,430
You've got stubby little legs.

201
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,640
Stubby little legs!

202
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,060
She's even got those lame hair
things that look like horns.

203
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,900
Raccoon-faced commoner!

204
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,980
You'll get your filthy commoner germs on us.

205
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,230
Go away, you stubby little raccoon.

206
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,440
With stubby little legs...

207
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,360
I'm... um...
Stubby little legs!

208
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,360
I'm... um...

209
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,200
I'm r-really sorry...

210
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,990
that I suddenly hit you yesterday!

211
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,120
I just wanted...

212
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,720
to be friends with you.

213
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,340
I'm sorry...

214
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,180
for having stubby little legs.

215
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,430
Sh-She felt so bad that
she's actually bawling?!
for having stubby little legs.

216
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,860
Sh-She felt so bad that
she's actually bawling?!

217
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,180
She's so demure.

218
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,930
I guess I didn't really need to interfere.

219
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,190
Well done, Anya. Good job apologizing.

220
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,230
Lord Damian, your face is bright red.

221
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,690
That's just because... I'm enraged!

222
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,030
I would never...

223
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,610
That's right. She defied me! Right to my face!

224
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,070
Yes...

225
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,000
She came right up to me...

226
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,370
Stared deep into my eyes...

227
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,460
N-No! That's not what's going on!

228
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,330
Stop pounding, my stupid heart!

229
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,000
She's a commoner! I would never...

230
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,590
No, never!

231
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,450
That's just too embarrassing.

232
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:16,060
Damn it all! I'd rather
die than ever admit it!

233
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,050
I will never forgive you!
My pride will not allow it!

234
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,530
Well said, Lord Damian!
A woman's tears cannot sway him!

235
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,150
We'll let you off the hook for today.

236
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,740
Lord Damian!

237
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,610
Her apology... was completely rejected?!

238
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,380
Plan B is done for.

239
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,800
By the way, why are we running?

240
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,140
Shut up!

241
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,510
School is... scary.

242
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,180
Becky!

243
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:01,090
Who was it?! Who the heck called me out here?!

244
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,050
That makes the denominator three,
and you get one-third.

245
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,440
Which means you have three thirds,
which is equal to one.

246
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,920
Simple, right?

247
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,170
L-Loid, why don't you both take a break?

248
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,250
Absolutely not. She has to learn
at least this much by today.

249
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,600
The incident with Damian the other day...

250
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,180
The "Friendship Scheme" that was meant
to bring us closer to the Desmonds...

251
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,180
completely fell apart.

252
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,000
Which means we need to go with
the orthodox method of Plan A,

253
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,130
and boost its chances of
success as much as possible.

254
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,780
If you don't finish this, you don't get
to watch your spy cartoon tonight.

255
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,320
Well? What's the answer here?

256
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,140
I'll finish this quick by reading Papa's mind.

257
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,900
Come on. You use this formula here...

258
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,490
In order to get the Stella needed
to become an Imperial Scholar,

259
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,820
there are other methods
such as excelling in sports

260
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,160
or doing community service.

261
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,570
But in order to halt getting
Tonitrus Bolts from bad grades

262
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,710
or being expelled from them,
we need to get her academic skills up.

263
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,540
I could enter the faculty room
and alter documents...

264
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,370
Are you all right, Miss Anya?!

265
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,590
I will read Mama's mind.

266
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,050
Mama, this question...

267
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,540
Let's think it over together.

268
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,780
Let's see... The denominator is five,
so that's one split into five.

269
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,090
Um... To make this easier to understand,

270
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,690
let's rip all four limbs off of a torso...

271
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,680
Oh, but then the head gets in the way.

272
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,410
Huh? Um...

273
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,130
Five... Five?

274
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,160
Doesn't a five look like an S?

275
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,570
Are you all right, Miss Anya?!

276
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,560
What's wrong? Well? Why can't you solve this?

277
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,360
I honestly can't figure out
what it is she can't understand.

278
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,500
I don't wanna study!

279
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,080
Hey, wait a minute!

280
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,640
L-Loid...

281
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,750
I don't think it's a good idea to
be too forceful at times like this.

282
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,390
Yes, but she needs to study more
to become an Imperial Scholar.

283
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,840
But is that something she wants for herself?

284
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,640
Well...

285
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,600
That's actually for my mission.

286
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:08,240
I would really like Miss Anya
to enjoy going to school.

287
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:12,750
Of course, she may need to study
so that she doesn't get expelled.

288
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,360
Yes... You're right.

289
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,270
She's still very young,

290
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,240
so getting good grades is
probably the least of her worries.

291
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,180
Oh, I'm sorry.

292
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,130
I shouldn't butt into
another family's affairs.

293
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:28,630
No, it's quite all right. Thank you, Yor.

294
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,900
I do lose my composure with her at times.

295
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,530
I'm sure other parents go
through the same thing.

296
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,110
Let's take a break.

297
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,360
I'll make us some tea.

298
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,570
Anya, we made you some hot cocoa.

299
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,140
And now she's holed up in her room.

300
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,590
I guess she's sulking now.

301
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,230
I'm gonna do my best in school!

302
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,550
She reminds me of my little
brother when he was small.

303
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,300
She'll come out eventually.

304
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,860
By the way, your brother works for the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, right?

305
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,550
He must have a brilliant academic record.

306
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,610
Did you help him with his homework?

307
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,640
If you have any tips for me...

308
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:28,910
Oh, no. Yuri was a much more
capable child than I was.

309
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:33,200
I'm embarrassed to admit it, but he
probably taught me more than I taught him.

310
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,520
Whenever we'd study together...

311
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,870
No, Sis. Spiders actually aren't insects.

312
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,450
Insects have six legs,

313
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:45,240
and their bodies are split up between
their head, thorax, and abdomen.

314
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,740
Wow... You're so knowledgeable, Yuri.

315
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,240
Whenever I complimented him,
his smile would light up the room.

316
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,930
Sis! Next, I'll teach you history!

317
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,470
S-Sure...

318
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,630
He must've enjoyed teaching me things,

319
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,200
because he'd always study on his
own even when I left him alone.

320
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,960
Sis, wake up! I learned
my times tables! Listen!

321
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,100
Mrfh...

322
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:14,080
I see. So part of his motivation
was earning your praise.

323
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,270
I'm not so sure about that,

324
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:23,290
but if that is the case, perhaps you can
be someone like that for Miss Anya.

325
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:29,790
It might be worth it to praise
her for the smallest things.

326
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,250
I think that'll make Miss Anya happy.

327
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:37,620
Well... I'm not so sure about that.

328
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,020
I'm not her real father, after all.

329
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,940
Wait, no.

330
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,480
That's right. I need to be the ideal father.

331
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,520
I need to play that part.

332
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,280
That was the foundation of this mission.

333
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,790
But up until now, nothing has been ideal,

334
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,720
and as a father, I've been...

335
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,040
It's all right.

336
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,980
Please be more confident in yourself.

337
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,230
Don't you remember what Miss Anya said?

338
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,040
That we're a perfect 100 points.

339
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:17,180
To Miss Anya, you're a wonderful father.

340
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,800
I'm grateful to hear you say that.

341
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,790
Oh, no. I butted in as a stranger again.

342
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,340
No, Yor.

343
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,570
You're not a stranger, nor part
of someone else's family.

344
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,310
Right now, you're the
mother of the Forgers.

345
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,580
I'm counting on you to provide
whatever I'm lacking.

346
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,600
Th-That's right. I'm actually someone's wife.

347
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,080
Don't say things like that
when we're out of the house.

348
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,110
It would be great if you could
look over Anya's homework, too.

349
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,630
Of course, if you think I can be of help.

350
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,210
Let's take our time and do our best together.

351
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,310
That's right. Don't panic, Twilight.

352
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,360
If this could be ended by
assassinating Desmond alone,

353
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,010
there would be countless methods,

354
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,020
but that won't get us to a true solution.

355
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,990
Nothing goes well in a short amount of time.

356
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,420
You need to know what your target
is thinking, what they desire,

357
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,690
then gain their trust and get close to
them so you can keep an eye on them.

358
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,740
Completing such mundane missions that
require patience makes a true spy.

359
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,530
First, I need to truly understand Anya.

360
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,940
Oh, look at the time.

361
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,080
I'll go have a chat with Anya.

362
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,880
Then I'll go ahead and do the dishes.

363
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:43,090
Hey, Anya. Your spy show's about to start.

364
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,310
I'm sorry about earlier.

365
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,840
Let's watch your show first,

366
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,290
and then we can figure out
what to do about your studies.

367
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,240
Anya?

368
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,730
She fell asleep.

369
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,410
You're going to catch a cold.

370
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,480
She was studying on her own?

371
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:16,170
I have to get the best grades
on my tests for Papa...

372
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,500
I guess I'll just record that show for her.

373
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,930
No, Mama. You can't kill Papa...

374
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,020
What exactly is she dreaming about?

375
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,220
Zzz...

376
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,170
A wonderful father, huh?

377
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,070
I wonder what it'd feel
like to have a real family.

378
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,080
Heya, Yuri! Working hard, I see!

379
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,030
Oh, it's been a while, Dominic.

380
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,670
I've been so busy with work that
I haven't been home at all.

381
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,610
Elites at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
sure are cut from a different cloth.

382
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:44,080
Oh, yeah. Dominic, how was
the party the other day?

383
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,620
What was the guy my sister went with like?

384
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,790
Oh, Yor's...

385
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,790
Ah... Actually, congrats, by the way.

386
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,190
Wait, you haven't met him yet?

387
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,300
Huh?

388
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,750
My sister got married?
