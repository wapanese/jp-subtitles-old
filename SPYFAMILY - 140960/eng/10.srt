1
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,900
Good morning, Master Henderson.

2
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,080
Good morning, sir.

3
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,780
Would you like some tea, as well?

4
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,820
Yes, I'd love some.

5
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:05,080
It's been a while since you were in
charge of the grade school kids.

6
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,920
How are the kids this year?

7
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,840
I must say, they show promise.

8
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,500
I heard you had to give one of them
a Tonitrus Bolt on their first day.

9
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,380
True, it was a rather rare occurrence
for our prestigious Eden College.

10
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,770
It's the first time I've heard
of it happening, too.

11
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,610
I only did what was necessary.

12
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,610
Good deeds shall be praised,

13
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,940
and misconduct will be met with punishment.

14
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,910
That is essential to education.

15
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,780
I have much to learn from you, sir.

16
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,210
As the elementary students pass
through the gates of Eden College

17
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:52,800
to learn true elegance every day,
our school's traditions shall live on.

18
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,010
Our house of learning exists to ensure
the future of our country is elegant.

19
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,030
Lord Damian!

20
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,120
Isn't this your older brother, Lord Damian?

21
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,740
Yes...

22
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,880
This must be his entrance ceremony!

23
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,460
He's probably elsewhere in this book, too!

24
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,630
Oh, there he is!

25
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,620
Ooh!

26
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,840
There he is again!

27
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,430
And here! He's truly an MVP!

28
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:45,140
Your brother is just raking in
the Stellas! How magnificent!

29
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,980
But I'm sure you'll become an Imperial
Scholar even faster, Lord Damian!

30
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,230
We all know you'll be the first
to get a Stella in our grade!

31
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,870
W-Well, yes.

32
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,110
But we still have a while until our exams.

33
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,450
Your first opportunity will be...

34
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,320
Our P.E. class next week.

35
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,290
We'll be having a dodgeball tournament
with the other classes!

36
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,500
My friend told me something he
heard from his friend in Class 7.

37
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,130
He said if you become MVP,
you can get a Stella!

38
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,250
Really?

39
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,590
This is your chance, Lord Damian!

40
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,430
MVP, eh?

41
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,660
It is a clear, sunny day.

42
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,450
Young ladies and gentlemen of Eden,

43
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,280
you will be adding another page
to Eden's history today...

44
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,300
Elegantly and brilliantly.

45
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,220
Shut up! You picked a fight with me first!

46
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,550
Anya didn't do anything wrong!

47
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,180
Exactly! First off, you—

48
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,470
Shut up, uggo!

49
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,270
Excuse me?!

50
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:10,930
Shithead.

51
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,680
Shut it, Stubby Legs!

52
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,480
You're not supposed to talk to girls like that!

53
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,610
Ele...gant.

54
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,450
I have returned!

55
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,450
Welcome home, Miss Anya.

56
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,120
Papa, I have acquired important news!

57
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,000
What?

58
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,630
You may be able to get a Stella
at your next P.E. class?

59
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,000
That's what Becky said.

60
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:08,260
My friend told me something she
heard from her friend in Class 7.

61
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:12,100
The MVP from the winning
class in next week's tournament

62
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,560
will receive a Stella!

63
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,770
So it's a rumor? That seems dubious.

64
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,400
Then we need to train, Miss Anya!

65
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,360
Training!

66
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,360
So what sport will you be playing?

67
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,570
Dodgeball.

68
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,610
Dodgeball...

69
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,830
That's the game where you hit your opponent
with a ball to do them in, right?

70
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,200
"Do them in"?

71
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,450
Mama! Teach me a killer move!

72
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:41,130
Very well! I shall teach you the
ultimate killer move with a ball.

73
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,840
Are you also athletic, Yor?

74
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,170
Oh, not exactly.

75
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,260
I just used to play catch
with my brother sometimes.

76
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,550
I can't tell them I rip people apart
and toss them around on a daily basis!

77
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,180
Just leave this to me, Miss Anya!

78
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,810
I'll show you a killer move that
will help you catch that star!

79
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,980
I will reach for the stars in dodgeball!

80
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,360
Anya will catch the star!

81
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,650
That's the spirit!

82
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,940
I'm glad she's so motivated... but...
That's the spirit!

83
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,190
Super Anya will catch the star!
I'm glad she's so motivated... but...

84
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,070
Super Anya will catch the star!

85
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,740
Yes!

86
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,330
We'll start with strength training.

87
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,040
One...

88
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,410
Two...

89
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,130
Three...

90
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,340
Four...

91
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,470
Five.

92
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,270
Six.

93
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,770
Stamina is crucial, too.

94
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,610
Miss Anya!

95
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,410
Now, listen carefully.

96
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,660
You're not just using your
arms when you throw the ball.

97
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,410
You need to make sure you
step out with your foot,

98
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,790
twist your hips as you shift your weight,

99
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,800
channel all of your strength
into your shoulder, and... throw!

100
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,100
Okay! Now you give it a try!

101
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,810
Oh, Loid.

102
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,070
This is training?

103
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:34,010
I don't really understand how,
but I did decide to let Yor handle this.

104
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,080
Miss Anya, please wake up.

105
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,910
Hey!

106
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,540
Hah!

107
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,880
Hup!

108
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,590
Slap!

109
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,420
Fwap!

110
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,050
Chwass!

111
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,400
I'm gonna catch that star tomorrow!

112
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:22,830
I did my best. I survived
Mama's ruthless training.

113
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,000
I even thought up a name for my killer shot.

114
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,290
I'm gonna seize that star!

115
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,390
I'm gonna get lots of stars...

116
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,850
so I can help Papa with his mission!

117
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,860
At least it's clear that you're motivated.

118
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,480
Just make sure you don't hold
Lord Damian back, Stubby Legs.

119
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,610
Second son... and his lackeys.

120
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,940
Why are we playing together with the boys?

121
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,900
Being on the same team
with him is the worst.

122
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,660
Second son... The son of Papa's
target for this mission.

123
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,120
Good things happen if
I become friends with him.

124
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,910
Wh-What are you staring at?!

125
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,290
But he gets really mean,
so I don't like him.

126
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,880
Well, I don't have any time to
waste on a runt like you, either.

127
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,040
A runt?

128
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,390
I'm going to get MVP in this tournament
and be rewarded a Stella.

129
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,850
I need to become an Imperial
Scholar just like my brother.

130
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,560
Otherwise...

131
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,610
Father will never notice me.

132
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,360
Hey, wait, Lord Damian!

133
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,110
Gather round!

134
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,900
Your usual P.E. teacher, Bobby,
is out sick, so I will be his substitute.

135
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,550
Do not forget to be proper
young men and ladies,

136
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,580
and execute the most elegant of plays.

137
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,160
Yes, sir.

138
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:58,920
We will now begin the dodgeball tournament
between Class 3, Cecile Hall,

139
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,970
and Class 4, Wald Hall.

140
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,720
You may now begin!

141
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,990
Let's show them who's boss, Lord Damian.

142
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,110
You've got this, Damian!

143
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,990
Lord Damian!

144
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,870
We gathered some intel on Class 4!

145
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,000
Good.

146
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,630
In order to be awarded a Stella,
you have to become the MVP.

147
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,760
My enemy...

148
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,340
is him!

149
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,850
In order to defeat Class 4
and win this match, first...

150
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,850
we need to defeat him!

151
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,690
The son of a command major, Bill Watkins.

152
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,490
Nice catch, Bill!

153
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,280
What the heck is that monster?!

154
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,490
There's no way he's our age!

155
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
It's him...

156
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,000
Bazooka Bill!

157
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,960
Because of his obviously
blessed physique and brains,

158
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,630
he won awards in all kinds of
sports tournaments in kindergarten.

159
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,330
The Monster of Bodam!

160
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,760
Are there even that many
tournaments in kindergarten?!

161
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,250
Wearing glasses right now
is dangerous, old man.

162
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,260
I humbly thank you for your concern,
Damian, son of Chairman Desmond.

163
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,020
But I'll be fine, because that
ball won't be hitting me.

164
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,260
Also...

165
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,270
Any hits above the shoulders don't count.

166
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,860
Enemy positions confirmed.

167
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,530
Airflow, humidity... both good.

168
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:47,950
Gerf.

169
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:48,700
Gah.

170
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,330
Four hits.

171
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:52,580
Wow! Way to go, Bill!

172
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,410
What?!
Wow! Way to go, Bill!

173
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,790
Is that even possible?!
Wow! Way to go, Bill!

174
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,910
Don't panic! That was just a fluke!

175
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,050
Oh, that wasn't a fluke.

176
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,720
When I throw the ball...

177
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,680
Every imaginable detail has been calculated.

178
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,890
We're not just talking simulations.
I've trained my body to its limit.

179
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,960
Daddy!

180
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,340
Ah, my son, Bill.

181
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,380
Yes, Daddy?

182
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:47,180
You will eventually be the hero
of Eden, as well as our army.

183
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,670
Make sure you seize those
Stellas with your own hands.

184
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,310
For the future of Ostania!

185
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,600
Sir, yes, sir!

186
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,180
Yes... my victory is predetermined.

187
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,320
Um, hello?! We'll die if
that actually hits us!

188
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,690
Don't worry. I'll hold back on you women.

189
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,990
Actually, that also pisses me off.

190
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,170
Gurk!

191
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,540
Hit.

192
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,120
That's some mouth you've got on you.

193
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,930
Do you really think we went into
this without a plan, you giant oaf?

194
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,800
You can't win...

195
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,340
at dodgeball all by yourself!

196
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,200
Ow!

197
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,370
You're gonna be the MVP! I just know it!

198
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,010
I'm gonna be the MVP!

199
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,170
Let's do this! Formation G!

200
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,180
Right!

201
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,770
Four hits.

202
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,280
I'm not done yet!

203
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,870
Ultimate...

204
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,450
...Shadow...

205
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,290
...Clone...

206
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,300
...Attack!

207
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,630
Shadow clone, eh?

208
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,090
Now, this is what you call...

209
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,050
a <i>real</i> shadow clone attack!

210
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,510
Lord Damian...

211
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:01,720
It was an honor to fight by your side.

212
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,730
Emile!

213
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,610
I know all kinds of great
things about you, Lord Damian.

214
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,230
Though I can't remember a single one
right now, I'm sure there was something.

215
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,730
Please win, Lord Damian!

216
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,980
Because you'll always be...

217
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,580
a true MVP in our hearts!

218
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,510
The forbidden... face block!

219
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,520
Emile!

220
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,680
Emile! Hey! Speak to me!

221
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,660
Ewen... you dummy. Don't cry.

222
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,360
I'm not crying!

223
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,400
It's not the end yet...

224
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:56,530
So don't give up hope.

225
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,160
Yeah. I know. I know!

226
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,750
Once we give up, it's game over—

227
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,870
Damn it! At this rate, we're gonna lose.

228
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,460
I need to find his weakness!

229
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,170
I don't care if the others go down.

230
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,840
I need to somehow survive and stand out!

231
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,050
Second son is a real shithead.

232
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,400
Next up...

233
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,850
we have that little runt over there.

234
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:23,020
I'm going to aim for... her feet!

235
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,730
Wha—

236
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,440
Hey! He missed! Nice!

237
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,530
Let's get the ball going!

238
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,030
She just...

239
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,860
jumped before I threw the ball!

240
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,400
Take this!

241
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,740
In that case...

242
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,030
I'll aim for her right arm!

243
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,700
Okay, her left!

244
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,790
I guess I'll just have to use my secret weapon!

245
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:53,960
This throw will suddenly change its course
and nail any opponent scampering about!

246
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,670
Take this!

247
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:59,730
Homing Slider Shot!

248
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,640
What was that about holding back on women?!

249
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:02,890
Blorf!

250
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,010
Blorf!

251
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,890
Hit.

252
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,110
That's impossible! She's
reading my every attack!

253
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,990
Who in the world is that girl?!

254
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,860
Hey, not bad...

255
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,410
Heh.

256
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,230
"Dodgeball," of course, stems from "dodge,"

257
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,410
meaning to swiftly move out of the way.

258
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,410
Such elegant evasion!

259
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,630
Anya! Look out for the guys out of bounds!

260
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,920
You dummy! Get up, quick!

261
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:41,290
You were impressive, but even you
can't dodge from that position!

262
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,020
Die!

263
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,510
The bastard just threw that
ball with everything he has!

264
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,020
It's unfortunate... But in the end,
this is her own fault.

265
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:54,610
Don't worry. I shall survive
and lead Class 3 to victory.

266
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,710
Hit.

267
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,180
Wh-What are you doing, Lord Damian?!

268
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,970
Oh, no! My chance at MVP!

269
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,140
You protected me?

270
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:25,550
Huh?

271
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,350
Are you a good guy?

272
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,890
N-N-No!

273
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,480
I was just frustrated that he was
taking out our team left and right,

274
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,650
so I tried to catch it...

275
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,190
Damn it all!

276
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,150
You're the only one left.
It's in your hands now.

277
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,910
The future is in Anya's hands.

278
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,460
Now is the time to unleash my killer shot!

279
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,790
Miss Anya, this is my final lesson for you.

280
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:58,170
The key to throwing a ball well is to
put your whole body into the throw.

281
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,010
Think of this ball as an arrow of light!

282
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,150
I won't let your death
go to waste, second son.

283
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,220
I'm not dead!

284
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,990
I will avenge you!

285
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,790
That power she had when she knocked me out...

286
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,380
She might just be able to...

287
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,420
I have no idea what's going on,
but this is intense.

288
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,840
Could it be...

289
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,110
The most important thing
is shifting my weight.

290
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,150
The power in my step
and the twisting of my hips

291
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,780
need to go to my widdle hands...

292
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,410
And then my widdle hands... um... um...

293
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,610
Anyway!

294
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,320
Killer Shot!

295
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,370
Star Catch Arrow!

296
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,290
Huh? What?

297
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,380
Huh?!

298
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,150
That's game.

299
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,260
Yay! We won!
Huh?

300
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,760
Yay! We won!

301
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,810
Huh?

302
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,850
Now you're definitely
getting that Stella, Bill!

303
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,520
Hm? Stella?

304
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:40,070
There are no Stella awarded for winning
a mere mini-game in a single class.

305
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,780
Who in the world suggested otherwise?

306
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,950
On the other hand, you had the nerve to yell
something as vile as "die" during the match,

307
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,990
so I have no issue with giving
you a Tonitrus Bolt instead.

308
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,940
Don't worry, Bill! We'll just
try harder next time!

309
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,850
We'll have another chance.

310
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,000
But to think...

311
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,130
Two students who were at odds with each other
worked together to take on this challenge.

312
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:08,120
This shows that you are worthy of
a Stella, young ladies and gentlemen.

313
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,400
You can't be serious, you moron!
What was that crappy throw?!

314
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,920
I shouldn't have defended you!

315
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,590
Shock!

316
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:17,710
What's your problem?
It's not like you hit anyone!

317
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,320
Anya doesn't like you after all.

318
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,620
What did you say, Stubby Legs?!

319
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,200
Or perhaps not.

320
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,510
Everything Mama teaches me is useless.
