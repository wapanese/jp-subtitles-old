1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:05,790
Everyone has a side they
don't show anyone else.

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,470
To their friends, their significant others,
or even their families.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,830
They hide what they're truly feeling
through fake smiles or bravado,

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,600
and keep their true identities secret.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,120
That is how the world keeps up
the appearance of its temporary peace.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,530
In an era in which the nations of
the world were waging a fierce war

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,920
of information just out of sight,

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,420
two countries were at odds with each other.

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,420
Ostania, in the east, was secretly
plotting to start a war.

10
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,190
Westalis, in the west, wanted to
put a stop to those plans.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,360
In order to keep an eye on the actions of a
leading figure in Ostania's government,

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,810
Westalis set Operation Strix in motion.

13
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,920
The one tasked with this operation
is the skilled agent, Twilight.

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,250
The mission given to the master of
disguise with a hundred faces was...

15
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,220
to start a family.

16
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,220
Is this everything you own?

17
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,800
Yes.

18
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,410
It's not very much.

19
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,730
Um, Loid... about the
sleeping arrangements...

20
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,640
We'll be sleeping in
separate rooms, of course.

21
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,210
We'll share one for appearances
anytime we have guests over.

22
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,770
R-Right.

23
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,370
Welcome to Anya's house!

24
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,720
Thank you for the lovely welcome, Miss Anya.

25
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,200
This house is home to
a rather unusual family.

26
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,440
The father, Loid Forger, is a psychiatrist.

27
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,300
His true identity: a spy.

28
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,240
Code name: Twilight.

29
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,350
The mother, Yor Forger, is a civil
servant who works at city hall.

30
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,400
Her true identity: an assassin.

31
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,780
Code name: Thorn Princess.

32
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,090
The daughter, Anya Forger.

33
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,760
Her true identity: a telepath.

34
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,520
I'm so happy to have a mama now!

35
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,430
Mama...

36
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,910
I'm gonna help.

37
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,440
Oh, right. By the way...

38
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,680
I had a friend of mine who's a judge
make it so we got married a year ago.

39
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,780
By that, I mean he forged the certificate.

40
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:19,010
We can figure out why we lived separately
and what to tell your brother later.

41
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,160
All right.

42
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:25,140
It would make the school suspicious if we
got married just before the interview.

43
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,380
I got permission from the Shopkeeper,
so I feel much better.

44
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,540
So exciting...

45
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,050
Father, mother, daughter...

46
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,360
These three created this pretend
family to further their own ends,

47
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,930
and are living under the same roof as they
hide their true identities from each other.

48
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,780
I'm going to show Mama around!

49
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,810
Once we get settled in,
we'll practice the interview.

50
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,970
This is the kitchen!

51
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,030
Papa is good at cooking!

52
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,310
Oh, I see.

53
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,930
This is the toilet. And that's the bathtub!

54
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,080
Everything's so clean.

55
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,950
I can wash my face all by myself!

56
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,330
You're such a big girl, Miss Anya.

57
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,830
This is Anya's room!

58
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,810
Welcome!

59
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,230
Thank you for inviting me in.

60
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,100
My, what an adorable room.

61
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,840
I'll introduce you to Mr. Chimera.

62
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,600
I am Chimera. It is a pweasure
to meet your acquaintenance.

63
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,150
It's very nice to meet you, Mr. Chimera.

64
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,110
I am Miss Anya's mama.

65
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,080
This is Papa's room!

66
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,560
So this is Loid's room...

67
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,400
This is your room, Mama.

68
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,950
Come in, Mama.

69
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,510
Why, thank you.

70
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,630
So this is my...

71
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,540
What a lovely room.

72
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,720
I'm glad you like it.

73
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,910
This should be everything.

74
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,720
Is the furniture arranged to
your liking? I also cleaned a bit.

75
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,690
Yes, everything is wonderful.

76
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,740
I helped clean, too!

77
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,430
Really? Thank you so much.

78
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,580
Am I a good girl?

79
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,750
All you did was tip over a bucket of water.

80
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,950
Shock!

81
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,530
This is such a lovely room. I don't
know what to do with myself.

82
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,060
What do you mean?

83
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,850
Please make yourself at home.

84
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,970
Actually, this <i>is</i> your home now,
so make yourself comfortable.

85
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,600
Thank you.

86
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,930
I'll come get your boxes once they're empty.

87
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,350
Loid, I've got everything put away.

88
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,320
You're quite efficient.

89
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,600
Ah, this must be your younger brother.

90
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,220
Oh, yes.

91
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,870
You said he's also a civil servant?

92
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:13,570
Yes. He seems quite busy lately,
so I've only spoken to him on the phone.

93
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,690
It seems you two are quite similar.

94
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,900
I should properly introduce myself
once Anya's entrance exam is over.

95
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,120
Um, Loid. About that...

96
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,710
I don't have anything suitable
to wear to this interview...

97
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,030
Then let's go to the tailor today.

98
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,430
Thank you very much.

99
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,950
Helping, helping...

100
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,670
M-Miss Anya, I'll take care of that!

101
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,170
I have my work weapons and poison
powerful enough to kill an elephant in there.

102
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,990
Can I get you something, Loid?

103
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,370
Some coffee, please. Black.

104
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,450
I want hot cocoa!

105
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,350
With sugar and milk.

106
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,460
That's the stuff!

107
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,690
They look amazing. Are those cookies homemade?

108
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,430
It's actually my first time making cookies.

109
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,840
I just followed a recipe from a cookbook,
so they should be decent.

110
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,680
I hope you like them.

111
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,720
Thank you.

112
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,150
They're wonderful! You really
are an amazing cook!

113
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,390
It's not that impressive, really.

114
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,430
I helped with the cookies, too!

115
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,690
Oh, I see.

116
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,750
After you got covered in
flour and got in my way,

117
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,060
you just snacked on some peanuts.

118
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,620
Once we're settled in, let's begin.

119
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,070
Eden College is one of the most
prestigious schools in the country.

120
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,120
During the interview, not only
will the child be evaluated,

121
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,900
but so will the parents.

122
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,910
They will be evaluated on their social
standing as well as how cultured they are.

123
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,120
Understood?

124
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,780
Now, let's start the questions.

125
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,190
First, please state your name and address.

126
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,790
Anya Fo...Fo...Horger. Address?

127
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,070
The place we're at right now.

128
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,340
This is Anya's house!

129
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,970
That's not what I meant.

130
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,070
Er, so, Miss Anya... How do
you spend your days off?

131
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,240
Papa orders me to stay home,

132
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,710
so I have to watch TV all alone.

133
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,070
Now, wait a second.

134
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,270
That makes a terrible impression. Madam?

135
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,220
Yes?

136
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,350
Why did you choose Eden College,
and how do you plan to pass this exam?

137
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,220
How do people usually pass?

138
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,220
Um, pass, passing...

139
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,340
Perhaps because of cardiac arrest,
or excessive bleeding?

140
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,930
Or compound fractures throughout the body?

141
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,200
Oh! Maybe their skull was caved in.

142
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,600
Kill me now. Next question.

143
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,930
Could you describe your parenting methods?

144
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,930
Huh? U-Um... Strike first to be victorious?

145
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,670
I'm amazed her brother turned
out to be a decent human being.

146
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,560
I've been a spy for over a decade.

147
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,950
I've completed countless missions,
yet only now do I find myself losing heart.

148
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,920
This is pointless. There's no way we'll
survive the interview at this rate.

149
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,550
Let's give up on getting
her into that school.

150
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,340
Loid! Please remember
your late wife's wishes!

151
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,710
Clearly, we weren't ready
for this mock interview yet.

152
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,830
All right, let's go out for a bit.

153
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,700
Let's broaden our horizons, become versed
in what is normal for an upper-class family,

154
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,630
and make sure that we're
all on the same page.

155
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,510
We're on an ooting,
an ooting, la, la, la, lah!

156
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,090
You mean "outing."

157
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,290
Wanna hold hands, Mama?

158
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,470
I-If you don't mind.

159
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,110
Thank goodness Anya's taken a liking to her.

160
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,290
The plan is set.

161
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,840
After today, we'll seem like a normal... no.

162
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,360
We'll be seen as an upper-crust family.

163
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,320
Oh... This reminds me of when my little
brother was still small and adorable.

164
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:44,990
And that one time I hugged him too hard
and ended up breaking two of his ribs.

165
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,590
I must be careful.

166
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,550
Wait... what? Maybe not...

167
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,610
B-By the way, where are we headed?

168
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,020
I've acquired a variety of tickets
through my connections at work.

169
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,010
Tradition and status are
everything at Eden College.

170
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,780
We'll have to experience and get accustomed
to the best that life has to offer,

171
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,210
and make sure we don't slip
up if we let our guard down.

172
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,870
All right, next.

173
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,300
Anya, no yelling while we're here.

174
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:37,900
'Kay.

175
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,600
We've experienced first-class music,

176
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,200
so now for some first-class art...
And you know the rest.

177
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,170
Papa! I can see her boobies!

178
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,390
Head's been choppy-chopped!
Body's been choppy-chopped!

179
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,650
What did I just say about yelling?

180
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,360
Yor?

181
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,770
Y-Yor...?

182
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,580
I wanna do that!

183
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,370
Drawing? Sure.

184
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,300
Yor, why don't we sit down for a bit?

185
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,110
All right.

186
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,670
Anya's house is a big castle.

187
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,050
The boss of the secret organization
is Director Chimera.

188
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,420
Papa is a spy! Pew, pew!

189
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,250
Mama is an assassin!
Stabby, stabby, sploosh!

190
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,920
We should probably get going.

191
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,230
Yes.

192
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,650
All done!

193
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,650
Anya, we're going to our next stop.

194
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,250
If Papa and Mama see this,
they'll find out about my powers!

195
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,390
Wow, that's quite a masterpiece.

196
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,240
There seems to be a pig in a forest.

197
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,710
That's Mr. Chimera, and he lives in a castle!

198
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,680
I see. I definitely see
Bondman there, though.

199
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,620
I'm right, aren't I?

200
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,710
Yep...

201
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,660
It's that spy cartoon you
were watching last week.

202
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,300
So this witch-looking one
must be the princess.

203
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,740
That part seems rather graphic.

204
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,050
Oh, but that cat is cute.

205
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:02,970
That's a doggy!

206
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,180
I see. Then I apologize.

207
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,600
We're going to the tailor next.

208
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,140
Sorry to have you do this on your day off.

209
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,370
It's quite all right. This is
something we need to do.

210
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,850
My going-out clothes are so cute!

211
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,330
They fit perfectly!

212
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,930
This shop is great! I love it!

213
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,120
Why, thank you.

214
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,130
This is my first ooting
in my going-out clothes.

215
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,370
Then it must be a day of celebration.

216
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,950
A day to celebrate this ooting!

217
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,730
In that case, we can stop by
a photography studio next.

218
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,860
Yor, dear. Right this way.

219
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,700
Coming.

220
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,820
If you're looking for a semi-formal dress,
I think this color would do nicely.

221
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,930
What do you think?

222
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,210
I'd honestly prefer a black or red dress.

223
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:49,760
Really? I think this would
look nice on you, Yor.

224
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,190
Then how about this?

225
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:55,650
Judging from her lack of luggage,
I thought she had no interest in clothes.

226
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,920
I see you're particular
about matching colors.

227
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,400
No... I wouldn't say that.

228
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,240
This color's lovely, but I'm worried that
blood splatters would be too noticeable.

229
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,890
Looks like Yor finally found someone nice.

230
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:19,130
Hopefully they last. Having a child
already is an instant no for me, though.

231
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,830
Looks like the extra outfits will
be ready by the interview, too.

232
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,860
I'm so sorry to have you get so many.

233
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,120
Well, you look nice in
colors besides red and black.

234
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,520
We'll be going out more often, too.

235
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,190
Ootings! Ootings!

236
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,840
You're a regular at that shop, aren't you?

237
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:40,150
I'm sure we'll continue to shop there, so next
time, we should tell them we're married.

238
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,580
Oh, right.

239
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,280
Patriotism is also important within Eden.

240
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,970
I'll need to make sure she's knowledgeable
of politics and history, as well.

241
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,490
Piss off, traitor!

242
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,120
Those bastards killed my family!

243
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,300
What's the matter?

244
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,610
I don't like places like this...

245
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,670
Sorry. Maybe this was a
little scary for you.

246
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,350
Let's go rest somewhere.

247
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,910
Damn it!

248
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,010
You pig!

249
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,110
Your feet smell, too!

250
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,790
Papa, I'm hungry.

251
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,630
Huh?

252
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,790
Are you all right or not?

253
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,230
No, Anya. Don't just pick the nuts off
the top, and no eating with your hands.

254
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:45,210
And Yor, uh... Hmm...

255
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,810
I've been a spy for over a decade.

256
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:52,720
I've completed countless missions,
yet once again I find myself losing heart.

257
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,460
S'all good, Papa.

258
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,390
What is?

259
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,990
Yeah, I definitely picked the wrong child.

260
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,900
No, this is all because I was
expected to rely on others.

261
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:09,480
I shouldn't have put the key to success in
the hands of others, let alone civilians.

262
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,910
Predicting every possible
situation, preparing for it,

263
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,480
and acting from a carefully laid-out plan.

264
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,350
Those are the ironclad rules of being a spy.

265
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,920
Which means that I need to list every
possible question the interviewer can ask,

266
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,690
then have these two memorize the
perfect answers to go with them.

267
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,540
If all else fails, make sure
I can back them up—

268
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,420
Um...

269
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,870
Why don't we go get some fresh air?

270
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,540
The people look like bits
of trash from up here.

271
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,040
Where did you get that from?

272
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,130
My cartoons.

273
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,030
Ah...

274
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,600
I had no idea there was a park like
this on the outskirts of town.

275
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,030
I don't come here that often either,

276
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,300
but I wander over here when
I'm exhausted from work.

277
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:01,570
Thinking about how the work I do
helps everyone in this city out

278
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,550
encourages me to work harder.

279
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,350
Oh, this place must be awfully
boring! I'm terribly sorry!

280
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,550
I like this place better
than crowded places!

281
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,350
Oh, that's wonderful!

282
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,900
Thief! Someone help!

283
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,760
That old lady should've been more careful.

284
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,440
You won't get away with this!

285
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,310
Hold it right there!

286
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,440
Oh, damn it.

287
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,950
I lost track of him.

288
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,690
Are you all right, ma'am? Are you hurt?

289
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,140
I'm fine. Just a few scratches.

290
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:49,160
I promise I'll catch him for you!
And I'll take you to the hospital later!

291
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,240
Why, thank you.

292
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,720
I left Loid and Anya behind.

293
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,720
He blended in with the crowd.

294
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,720
I'm very sorry, Yor, but you probably
won't be able to find him now.

295
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,740
Man, I'm starving.

296
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,210
So expensive...

297
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:10,350
Crap, I'm gonna piss my pants.
So expensive...

298
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,080
Crap, I'm gonna piss my pants.

299
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,110
My feet hurt.
Crap, I'm gonna piss my pants.

300
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:12,730
My feet hurt.

301
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,150
I wonder if there's a million
dalc lying around somewhere.

302
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,270
What am I going to do? I failed my test again.

303
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,170
That bastard. I'm gonna murder him.
What am I going to do? I failed my test again.

304
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,250
What am I going to do? I failed my test again.

305
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,660
Hey, this again?

306
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,740
Man, that old crone was loaded.

307
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,770
Papa!

308
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,090
Whoa, what?

309
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,840
I wanna eat cake!

310
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,760
What?!

311
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,510
We just left the restaurant...

312
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,350
He's...

313
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:44,600
He changed his clothes, but it's not
so easy to change the way you walk.

314
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,200
Don't think you'll get away from me.

315
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,680
Loid!

316
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,230
Mama's here.

317
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,010
Yor, look after Anya for me.

318
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,640
I'll be able to have plenty of
fun for a while with this much.

319
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,230
First, I'm gonna treat myself
to the finest meal and—

320
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,150
A filthy swine like you deserves
nothing more than the foulest meal.

321
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,690
What's going on?

322
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,690
A spy must not bring attention to himself.

323
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:19,330
Pardon me. This fellow is a purse snatcher,
so please call the police and hand him over.

324
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,880
A purse snatcher?

325
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,080
Thank you for escorting
me all the way here.

326
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,980
I had money to get my grandchild
a gift in my purse.

327
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,920
Thank you so much. You were a big help.

328
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,980
Oh, actually...

329
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,890
The one who got it back
was my, um, husband.

330
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:42,260
No, if you weren't there, Yor,
I wouldn't have even gone after him.

331
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,970
Thank you so much. What a
fine gentleman you are.

332
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,120
Er, again...

333
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,430
Hero who casts no shadow,

334
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,040
the great deeds you and your fellow
agents do shall never see the light of day.

335
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,270
Thank you.

336
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,060
I guess... receiving thanks every
once in a while wouldn't hurt.

337
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,600
Papa is a softie.

338
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,500
Thank you, Yor.

339
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,720
Today was a nice change of pace.

340
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,320
Now I'll be able to work hard again.

341
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,570
Papa and Mama are flirting.

342
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,120
We are not!

343
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,820
Does Anya get a thank you, too?

344
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:28,370
Well... I guess we did find the thief
because you were hungry again.

345
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,620
Good girl.

346
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:34,920
My, what a lovely family you are.

347
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,620
Here's some candy for you, dear.

348
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,020
Candy!

349
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,620
Make sure you say, "Thank you."

350
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,660
The ooting is over!

351
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,650
What a long day.

352
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,640
Mama!

353
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,140
I want some hot cocoa, please!

354
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,400
As you wish.

355
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,170
Hey, more importantly, we need
to retry this mock interview.

356
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,360
So, Miss Anya, how do you
spend your days off?

357
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,230
We go to the opera, the museum,
and eat at restaurants.

358
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,230
Yes! Exactly!

359
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,470
If you're asked this question,
make sure you talk about today.

360
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,820
Okay, next question.

361
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,360
You've seen your friend
do something naughty.

362
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,360
What will you do?

363
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,300
I'd jump on top of them, beat them up,
and make them eat the foulest meal!

364
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,340
Hmm... Pretend you never saw that, okay?

365
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,820
Yup, this is hopeless. I'm done.

366
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,860
Papa, you were so cool!

367
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,810
Yes, he was.

368
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,200
Ka-bam!

369
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,120
It's the foulest meal for you!

370
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,700
Hot cocoa is the best.

371
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,850
My, what a lovely family you are.

372
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,110
I guess if she saw us that way...

373
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:20,780
About one percent of my
preparations are complete.
