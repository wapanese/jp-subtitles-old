1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,240
If you're really married,
then prove it to me.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,230
Kiss right here and now.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,280
If that's all it takes...

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,220
What?!

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,000
A kiss? A kiss?!

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,290
Doesn't that mean... um...

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:22,840
Oh, yes. I've read somewhere that
your first kiss tastes like lemons.

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,240
That'll go perfectly with
this marinated fish.

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,240
Calm down, Yor! Get a hold of yourself!

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,330
Here I go.

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,000
O-O-O-One second, please.

12
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,470
There is no way I can do this sober.

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,260
Fank you for waiting...

14
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,620
Uh... right.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,820
We don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,050
This ish for my sake, as well.
I will do my besht.

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,030
What are you two whispering about?!

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,800
Can you do it or not?!

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,570
Prove to me that you're
really a married couple!

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,080
Keep your mouf shut, Yuri.

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,720
We will now show you just how in wuv we are.

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,610
Here I come, darling.

23
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,340
Now, cwose your eyes.

24
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,960
S-Sis!

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,890
Um... Yor?

26
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,530
Sis...

27
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,790
How lewd!

28
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,570
Sis!

29
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,550
Look! I scored the highest
in my whole class!

30
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,300
Oh, how wonderful!

31
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,660
I'll reward you with a kiss.

32
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,540
Smooch!

33
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,800
Sis...

34
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,280
When I grow up...

35
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,540
I'm gonna marry you.

36
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,480
Oh, my.

37
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,210
Then I guess I'll just have
to wait patiently for you.

38
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,810
...wait patiently for you.

39
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,310
You...

40
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,650
You can't, Sis!

41
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,340
Seeing you kiss another man
in front of me is just...

42
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,520
I won't allow—

43
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,540
Oh, I knew it...

44
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,960
I just can't!

45
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,790
—itpppppbt!
I just can't!

46
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,790
—itpppppbt!

47
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,550
No!

48
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,640
Izzit the end of the world?

49
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,360
Huh?! Um, Yuri?

50
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,300
I see how it is, Sis.

51
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,350
You're going to treat me like that just
because I tried to stop you from kissing him.

52
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,960
I guess you just couldn't wait to
do naughty things with him!

53
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,830
I was a fool to test you.

54
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,590
Perhaps my feelings were what
was truly being tested here!

55
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,370
Um... more importantly, you're bleeding.

56
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,830
Loid Forger... You may lay claim
on my sister's lips for now.

57
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,390
Wha—

58
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,950
What are you talking about?!

59
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,500
Right... Well, I'll let you
off the hook for today.

60
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,390
But just remember—

61
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,180
No, really. You're bleeding.

62
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,280
Is this just normal for the Briars?

63
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,060
Are you all right, Yuri?
You're about to fall over.

64
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,800
Did you really just say that?
I'm fine.

65
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,360
Well, so are you, Sis.

66
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,720
Shall I call you a taxi?

67
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,240
I'm fine. You're such a worrywart, Sis.

68
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,570
Whoa, there!

69
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,790
Wipe that smirk off your face!

70
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,280
Are my failures that amusing to you?!

71
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,160
Er, no. I was just admiring
what lovely siblings you are.

72
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,440
You must have always been
there for each other.

73
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,350
Yuri, thank you for protecting
Yor up until now.

74
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,690
I'm sure you've been through many hardships.

75
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,220
I'll also do everything I can to
be there for her from now on,

76
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,810
so let's do everything we can
to make sure Yor is happy.

77
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,320
Like I'd ever ask for your help!

78
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,450
Forget it! I'm going home!

79
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,370
Feel free to come over anytime!

80
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,550
I'm sure that'll make Yor happy.

81
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,280
You should come when my
daughter's awake next time.

82
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,220
Miss Anya was doing everything she
could to stay up to meet you.

83
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,420
She's absolutely precious,
so I hope you'll play with her.

84
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,180
I don't need him to invite me! I'll be back!

85
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,710
Next time, I'll prove that
you're tricking my sister!

86
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,640
I am not being tricked!

87
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,730
Now, hear me, Loid Forger.

88
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,230
If you make my sister cry even a little bit,

89
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,270
I will have you ex—

90
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,280
Um... well, you know.

91
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,200
Just know that you'll rue the day!

92
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:34,960
Be careful getting home, dear!

93
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,040
Sis!
Be careful getting home, dear!

94
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,360
Be mindful of your yelling!
It'll disturb the neighbors!
Sis!

95
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,740
Be mindful of your yelling!
It'll disturb the neighbors!

96
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,890
Was he about to say he'd have me executed?

97
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:41,910
I should be careful.

98
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,160
Any wiretaps?

99
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,360
Looks like we're clear.

100
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,930
Since he's with the secret police...

101
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,430
Well, because he's her brother,
he may just try that.

102
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,860
I need to be on my guard.

103
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,830
Loid, thank you very much.

104
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,180
I'm a bit embarrassed to say so,

105
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,660
but thank you for welcoming him into
your family, despite his rudeness.

106
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,510
Yuri clearly loves you very much, Yor.

107
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,570
I don't have any family or friends
I can rely on, other than my daughter,

108
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,940
so I admit that I was a
little envious of you two.

109
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,210
Loid...

110
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,520
Though my daughter is also
just part of a pretend family.

111
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,710
Well, anyway. I'm glad he didn't find
out about our pretend marriage.

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,810
Yes.

113
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,100
I'm suddenly very tired,
now that I'm relieved.

114
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,420
Why don't we head to bed after we clean up?

115
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,320
Er, in separate beds, of course!
I'll change things back!

116
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,590
R-Right.

117
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,790
Papa... Pwease save Earth...

118
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:57,180
Now, Yuri... You'll make
me mad if you hit Loid...

119
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,230
I can't remember the last time
I felt envious of another.

120
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,130
I should sleep. I'm sure I'm just exhausted.

121
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,340
Yet my mission still continues on tomorrow.

122
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,260
I beg your pardon.

123
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,080
Which way is the station?

124
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,120
Get to the hospital first, pal!

125
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,400
Morning, pwease.

126
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,530
You seem very green today, Papa.

127
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,740
Quit talking in your sleep
and go wash your face.

128
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,700
Good morning!

129
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,860
It's too bad you didn't get
to meet Yuri yesterday.

130
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,230
Who's that?

131
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,390
Huh?! But she was so looking
forward to meeting him!

132
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,470
Things sure did get lively yesterday.

133
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,220
I'm very sorry.

134
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,740
Who'd have thought Yor's
brother would be like that?

135
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,990
Oh! Unkie!

136
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,990
And he's part of the secret police,
my greatest foe as a spy.

137
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,270
S-Secret police?!

138
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,100
What's that?

139
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,490
"Secret" plus "police"...

140
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,500
That sounds so exciting!

141
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,280
Why didn't you introduce me to him?!

142
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,790
Gimme back the excitement I wasted!

143
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,840
You wanted to meet him that badly?

144
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,990
Well, at least the storm has passed for now.

145
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:39,020
I need to concentrate on Anya's education.

146
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,790
Come on, hurry up and eat. You'll be late.

147
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,010
Om... nom...

148
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,900
Don't worry, you'll be able to see him soon.
Om... nom...

149
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,860
Has the threat truly passed?

150
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,470
Yor Briar, whose younger brother
is a member of the secret police...

151
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,400
Previously, there was nothing
suspicious surrounding her.

152
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,960
She didn't seem to know what her
brother's true occupation is,

153
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,730
so my intuition says she's still clear.

154
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,600
Besides, if she knew her brother
worked at the State Security Service,

155
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,410
there'd be no concern over suspicions
arising about her being single.

156
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,670
No, it's dangerous to be too certain.

157
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:14,650
What if she was just acting and this
was all a lie to get closer to me?

158
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,840
Suspect everything, Twilight.

159
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,480
Papa, Mama is...

160
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,720
What is it?

161
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,240
Mama is...

162
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,250
bad at cooking.

163
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,230
So it was obvious that I made
breakfast this morning!

164
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,880
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

165
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,610
I did do my best.

166
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,300
Ah, by the way, Yor...

167
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,090
Yes?

168
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,550
Er, I just...

169
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,300
I guess putting a listening device
on her is going too far.

170
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,660
No, I need to silence any doubts now.

171
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,500
Even a moment's carelessness
could mean death.

172
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,100
It could also mean the lives
of tens of thousands of people.

173
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,600
I need to do this to prove Yor's innocence.

174
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,800
You've got something on your neck.

175
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,180
Huh? Thank you very much.

176
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,680
That startled me. I thought he was
going to give me a kiss goodbye.

177
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,400
Wha?!

178
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,490
I s-still haven't forgotten
about last night...

179
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,670
I can't kiss or even cook.

180
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,500
Loid managed to smooth
things over last night,

181
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,510
but I'm probably not acting like a proper wife.

182
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,120
I may be imagining it, but Loid
seems a bit more distant today.

183
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,140
Maybe he's gotten sick of
me being so disappointing.

184
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,740
I need to be on my guard.

185
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,050
What's the matter, Anya?

186
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,190
Mama and Papa need to get along.

187
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,930
W-Well, we aren't fighting or anything.

188
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,210
Th-That's right.

189
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,840
And you make sure you get
along with your classmates.

190
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,040
Yep.

191
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,660
We should get going, too.

192
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,910
Oh, right.

193
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,510
Children are so curiously observant at times.

194
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,010
Hey, Yuri.

195
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,800
Why are you covered in bandages?

196
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,270
Didn't you go celebrate your
sister's wedding yesterday?

197
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,090
I don't really remember what happened.

198
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,940
You probably got drunk and picked
a fight with her husband.

199
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,620
You really need to quit drinking.

200
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,660
Well, I can't let a guy like
that be with my sister.

201
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,490
Was he that disagreeable?

202
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,810
I think...

203
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,200
he was...

204
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,650
a good guy.

205
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,720
But con men and spies always
try to act like good people.

206
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,480
That's it! Hopefully he's a spy!
Then I can throw him in a cell!

207
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,550
Calm down. Do you have any proof of this?

208
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,170
Shit!

209
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:10,070
I totally forgot to bug their
living room and bedrooms!

210
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,770
Wait, no!

211
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:15,710
If I happened to hear Sis's
voice in those<i> situations,</i>

212
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,530
my heart wouldn't be able to bear it!

213
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,260
Did you give yourself those injuries?

214
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,790
You need to detach from your sister so
you can concentrate on your work more.

215
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,220
Our job is to capture

216
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,450
spies from the West, namely, Twilight.

217
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:38,050
Because that will lead
to your sister's safety.

218
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,970
I know that. For now...

219
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:46,430
Loid Forger, the day you make my sister cry...

220
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,380
What's with her?

221
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,800
She said something like,
"I'm a failure of a wife."

222
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,750
Heya.

223
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh, Sharon.

224
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,070
Huh? How do you become a good wife?

225
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,250
Are you two not getting along?

226
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,560
Well, it's not exactly that...

227
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,320
It's just... This is my first time
being with a man in general,

228
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,970
so I'm unsure of how to act.

229
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,670
I was curious when I looked
into her past connections,

230
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,290
but I guess Yor has really
never dated a man before.

231
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:26,300
I'm worried that things
can't go on like this.

232
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,090
It doesn't help that I can't cook.

233
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,490
Anya's words really got to her.

234
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:37,560
It appears that Yor is trying to seem more
wifely for the sake of our pretend family.

235
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,180
No, wait.

236
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,570
She could also be trying to act like the
perfect wife to put one over on me.

237
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:47,250
It must be rough when your husband
is clearly so much better than you.

238
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,370
Why don't you two just call it quits?

239
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,670
Er, I'd like to avoid that.

240
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,550
Yor's relationship with her
coworkers seems a bit, er, uh...

241
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,450
Hey, you four!

242
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,270
Quit yapping and get to work.

243
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,760
Gah! It's the section chief.

244
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,840
Say, Yor...

245
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,580
Could you go drop this off
at the post office for me?

246
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,890
Yes, sir.

247
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,330
I guess I'll have to make a move if
I want to clear the air for good.

248
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:24,340
Come to think of it, Loid and
I have separate bank accounts.

249
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:29,090
If I contributed a bit of my
earnings from my actual job,

250
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:32,210
would I be able to help Loid out?

251
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,830
But I can't make him suspicious of me, either.

252
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,930
Not to mention, I don't think this
was really a financial issue...

253
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:43,200
You there. I'd like to
ask you a few questions.

254
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,580
May we have a bit of your time?

255
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,090
Th-The secret police!

256
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,490
D-Did I do something wrong, sir?

257
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:56,140
Was I being far too suspicious by
looking at ads meant for families,

258
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,890
when I'm clearly lacking as a wife?

259
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,310
I-I-I'm married!

260
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,820
We're not hitting on you.

261
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,560
What the hell is this?!

262
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,070
You call me outta nowhere and
tell me to dress like this

263
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,480
so we can question your wife?!

264
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,050
Just shut up and follow the plan.
This is all for my mission.

265
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,850
I've got nothing to do with that!

266
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:19,200
We are inspecting the mail.

267
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,310
You just tried to mail this...

268
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,240
But it clearly contains a code
meant for the West.

269
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,400
Is the sender, Burns, your superior?

270
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,830
Y-Yes.

271
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,010
What is your name?

272
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,260
Yor Bri—

273
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,420
I-It's Yor Forger.

274
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,260
Well, well, well... Yor Forger, eh?

275
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:43,260
It clearly states your name
right here as a collaborator!

276
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,740
He's really into this.

277
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,320
So you're in cahoots.

278
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,330
I-I have no idea about this.
This must be some kind of mistake.

279
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,270
You'd be better off if you told the truth.

280
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,700
Speaking of city hall, someone from the
finance department was caught the other day.

281
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,560
Clearly, the corruption within
has spread far and wide.

282
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,290
I heard he met a pitiful end.

283
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,760
The intense torture got to
him physically and mentally,

284
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,040
and he apparently offed himself in his cell.

285
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,230
And I heard last month, they caught
another woman around this chick's age.

286
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,230
You know, that official's secretary.

287
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,490
What kind of characterization is he going for?

288
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,020
Ah, her.

289
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,340
She was freed once we found out she
had family in State Security Service.

290
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,490
Man, talk about an awesome benefit.

291
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:27,990
Our family members can be let off
the hook of most allegations.

292
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,030
Enough talking. You'll be
coming with us to the station.

293
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,580
If she's aware that Yuri works
for the State Security Service,

294
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,790
this will all be solved as soon
as she mentions Yuri's name.

295
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,450
There's no reason for her to be
secretive to one of his coworkers,

296
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,580
and if she resists, she'll further
make us suspicious.

297
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,100
Come on, Yor. If you're in on this,
ask your brother for help.

298
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,050
And if you're not...

299
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,780
I...

300
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,120
work hard every day for the
citizens of this country.

301
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,440
I would never participate in espionage!

302
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,090
No use playing dumb with us!

303
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,250
Just shut up and come with—

304
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,120
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

305
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,070
I'm quite certain I mentioned
that I was married.

306
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,120
Please do not touch me so casually.

307
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,420
You do realize you're putting your family
in danger by doing this, don't you?

308
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,120
My younger brother and husband are both kind

309
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,620
and upstanding members of society.

310
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,660
If you ever unjustly harm either of them,

311
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,910
I frankly do not care if
I'm dealing with you two.

312
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,620
I will show no mercy!

313
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,580
Hey, Second Lieutenant Mop...

314
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,780
Are you certain about this cipher?

315
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,410
What? Of course I'm—

316
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,830
What the?!

317
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,120
Looking closer, this is clearly
not the raccoon cipher.

318
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,080
It's the caterpillar cipher!

319
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,970
If we decode this message...

320
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,440
This is a letter Burns sent to a
renowned hemorrhoids doctor.

321
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,320
Huh?

322
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,850
I see. He used a cipher because
he was embarrassed.

323
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,780
How confusing.

324
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,540
So, yes, it would appear
we had the wrong idea.

325
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,340
Your name isn't on here at all.

326
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:07,780
You may leave, but make sure you keep
quiet about this for Mr. Burns's sake, too.

327
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,540
Well, that was quite the farce.

328
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,660
Considering how she acted, it's pretty clear
she has no connections with the secret police.

329
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:26,450
Hey, come on. Don't tell me you
feel guilty for doubting her.

330
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,430
I don't.

331
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:31,240
I've warned you about this before, but don't
develop unnecessary feelings for her.

332
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,170
If you value your life, don't trust anyone.

333
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,620
We have no other way to survive.

334
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,650
Somehow, it's extremely infuriating
to hear those words from that face.

335
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,490
But <i>you</i> made that face!

336
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,940
Damn it! I thought I could land
a few chicks with that face on.

337
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,390
My precious hot-guy face!

338
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,580
It's a terrible idea to date
a woman while deceiving her.

339
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,910
Did you really just say that?

340
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,700
Today was terribly nerve-wracking.

341
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,840
I was almost arrested, meaning not
only would I be ruined as a wife,

342
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,810
but I would've destroyed the Forgers.

343
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,250
Oh, hello, Yor.

344
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,350
Loid...

345
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,150
What a coincidence. Why don't
we go home together?

346
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,890
Oh? There's something on
your collar again, Yor.

347
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,210
I'm so sorry.

348
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:29,520
Apparently, I'm such a failure as wife that
I can't even keep up proper appearances.

349
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,120
Well, if you ask me, Yor...

350
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,530
Perhaps many families throughout this
world are somehow putting on an act,

351
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,640
thinking, "A wife should be like this,"
or, "You're supposed to be the parent."

352
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:45,880
Of course, I believe that working hard
to be your best self is admirable.

353
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,880
But if you dwell on that so
much that you lose yourself,

354
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,390
things that should go well might fall apart.

355
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:58,410
Many people suffering like that
come to my hospital all the time.

356
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,480
Putting on an act all the
time can become tiring.

357
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,160
Loid...

358
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,750
And that's why I want you
to be as you are, Yor.

359
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,840
The more confident you seem,
the less people will suspect anything.

360
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,450
And I'm sure Anya will be
happier seeing you smile.

361
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,360
Thank you very much. I...

362
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,670
I'm truly grateful that I married you, Loid!

363
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,120
Don't tell me you feel
guilty for doubting her.

364
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,970
What did you just throw away?

365
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,770
Oh, just the lint I found
on your collar earlier.

366
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,690
More importantly,

367
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:53,890
we didn't even do anything to celebrate
our one-year wedding anniversary.

368
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,870
Why don't we buy some cake on our way home?

369
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,300
That's a lovely idea!

370
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:06,140
Papa, Mama! I have returned!

371
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,760
Welcome home, Miss Anya.

372
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,710
What's the matter?

373
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,990
Papa and Mama are getting along!

374
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,470
I told you that we were never
fighting to begin with.

375
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,850
We have cake, Miss Anya!

376
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:26,030
I want some cake!

377
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,350
Hey, now. You're going to
bother the people downstairs.
