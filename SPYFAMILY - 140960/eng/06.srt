1
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,200
And... 99.5.

2
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm two millimeters bigger than last time!

3
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,460
I'm sure it's just an error.

4
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,460
You never know. Kids grow up so quickly.

5
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,500
Indeed.

6
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,210
Well, with that in mind, we should probably
have your uniform made a little bigger.

7
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,760
But it was quite a shock to hear that
you were suddenly married, Yor.

8
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,220
You should have told me the
last time you were here!

9
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,980
I'm, er, sorry about the other day.

10
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:11,520
And to think that your lovely daughter is
going to the prestigious Eden College.

11
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,980
Congratulations.

12
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,480
Fank you very much.

13
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,110
Are you an Eden College alum?

14
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,160
Oh, no. I went to an insignificant
little school out in the country.

15
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,780
Oh, then do be careful.

16
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:29,080
There's something of a wall between parents
who are Eden alumni and those who aren't.

17
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,000
Apparently this causes discrimination and
bullying among the children, too.

18
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,970
Oh, and hazing from the honor students,

19
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,840
and conflict between the
dorm kids and commuters.

20
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,840
Speaking of, I hear that kidnappings
of commuter kids are on the rise.

21
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,770
It's not surprising, considering most of the
kids who can attend Eden are rich.

22
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,600
I don't wanna go to school anymore.

23
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,230
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

24
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,780
Don't worry. There are plenty
of fun things about it, too.

25
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,400
Okay, all done with your measurements.

26
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,330
Let's see, you'll be getting one uniform,

27
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,000
plus a winter coat, a vest, and a sweater,
for three additional items.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,250
You're a regular here, so I'll
get those done immediately.

29
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,670
Oh, you'll be able to get everything else
you need from the shop on the corner.

30
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,000
This is going to cost more than I thought.

31
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,590
What's the matter?

32
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,640
I am in fear that I will be kidnapped.

33
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,770
Oh, I see. You sure didn't waste any time.

34
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,690
Yor, is it all right if we eat out today?

35
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,520
Yes, of course.

36
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,270
Are there any kidnappers at the restaurant?

37
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,860
Here's our special for the day.

38
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:44,780
Pork sautÃ© in pawpaw sauce with
porcini mushrooms and potato potage.

39
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,410
Po?

40
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,490
Looks delicious.

41
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,620
Must be cipher P.

42
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,290
Ah, a notice about my briefing.

43
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,630
It'll be in five days at
1300 hours at safe house D.

44
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,710
Understood.

45
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,340
But I really need to ask them to stop
using this notification method.

46
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,050
There's something unpleasant about it.

47
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,550
Hello?

48
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,140
Oh, yes, hi.

49
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,970
What? It's done already?

50
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,560
All right. We'll come
pick up the order today.

51
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,350
Thank you.

52
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,020
Is the uniform done?

53
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,530
Sounds like it.

54
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,780
But I have my briefing today.

55
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,780
I'm sorry to trouble you, Yor,

56
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,780
but could you go pick
it up with Anya for me?

57
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,120
I got called into work.

58
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,910
Of course. You can count on me.

59
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:39,800
I might not get home until late, so you
can go ahead and get delivery for dinner.

60
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,550
All right.

61
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,880
Have a knees day.

62
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,840
Good day... or perhaps
good evening, Agent Twilight.

63
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,340
Hello, Handler. What's this about?

64
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,670
Before we get into that...

65
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,590
What in the world were all
those expenses the other day?!

66
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,350
A castle rental fee, and rental fees
for furniture to go in said castle?!

67
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,230
You think we're made of money?!

68
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,270
Oh, here's a couple more bills, actually.

69
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,270
Going to school is apparently very expensive.

70
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,940
I have to admire the balls it takes to
just casually hand me more bills.

71
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,150
Well, they're all necessary expenses.

72
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,230
Very well. Anyway...

73
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,910
I'm here today to brief you
on phase 2 of Operation Strix.

74
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,740
Though you're usually on the ball,
so that may not be necessary.

75
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,950
Well... I may actually
be off my game lately.

76
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,710
Phase 2 requires a social gathering.

77
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:02,460
Before we get into the details,
let's review how Eden works.

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,550
Eden College.

79
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,010
There are around 2,500 students

80
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,510
ranging from the ages of six to nineteen,
and the curriculum covers all thirteen years.

81
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,470
Academics, sports, the arts...

82
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,470
They offer a top-class
education in every field.

83
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,440
The students who manage to shine
brighter than their fellow elites

84
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,980
are the honor students known
as the Imperial Scholars.

85
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,990
The social gathering that Desmond attends

86
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,360
is only open to those Imperial
Scholars and their parents.

87
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,490
In order to become an Imperial Scholar,

88
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,330
a student must earn eight
merits known as "Stella."

89
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,370
Stella Stars are awarded for exceptional
grades and contributions to society.

90
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,920
Which means, first, you need to raise
your daughter into an honor student.

91
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,370
You may use underhanded
means if necessary.

92
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,300
On the other hand,

93
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,350
poor grades and bad behavior will result
in demerits called Tonitrus Bolts.

94
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,270
When a student receives eight of those,
they will be immediately expelled,

95
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,270
so be aware of that.

96
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,900
Now, let's work out the finer details.

97
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,980
Turning that child into a honor student...

98
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,280
Hello, anxiety, my old friend.

99
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,870
Do I look cute in my uniform?

100
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,950
Oh, you look absolutely adorable!

101
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,660
Let's go to the portrait studio later!

102
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,080
Ta-da!

103
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,130
Do I look cute?

104
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,800
Oh, you look absolutely adorable!

105
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,420
Could you leave already? How many
times are you gonna say that?

106
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,430
I wanna go on an ooting in this!

107
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,800
Yes, let's do that!

108
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,220
Thanks much.

109
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,440
Doot, do! Doot, do! Doot, do!

110
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,600
Why don't we stop by the park?

111
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,860
This is my uniform. Ta-da!

112
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,890
I am wearing my uniform. Ta-da!

113
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,320
My, your daughter's adorable.

114
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,870
She goes to Eden? I'm so jealous.

115
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,370
Oh... Hello.

116
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,670
Mom, I'm hungry.

117
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,080
And what would you like for dinner?

118
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,670
Hamburg steak!

119
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,680
So you <i>do</i> prefer your old mother.

120
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,760
I want to be with them forever.

121
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,020
I know that we're just a pretend family.

122
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:21,680
But...

123
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:27,400
Maybe I could be more of a mother to her.

124
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,190
Mama!

125
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,450
I just showed everyone how cute I am!

126
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,620
Make sure you don't dirty your
uniform before you go to school.

127
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,290
Say, Miss Anya. Why don't we stop
by the supermarket on our way home?

128
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,130
Loid said he was going to be home
late, so I'll make dinner tonight.

129
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:48,840
Ooh!

130
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,500
Can you cook, Mama?

131
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,090
Yes. I will do my very best.

132
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,430
Hey, is that kid from Eden?

133
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:56,970
Huh?

134
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,100
Is the chick next to her the mom?

135
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,470
She's gotta be the hired help.

136
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,770
No rich person's gonna
go shopping themselves.

137
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,110
You know, I think I want an allowance.

138
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,480
Me, too.

139
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,990
I'm sure I'll be able to make something
if I have some meat and vegetables.

140
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,240
I'm not sure what any of these are,
so I'll just buy all of them.

141
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,530
Ta-da!

142
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,700
I'm going outside now. I'm bored.

143
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,540
Oh, don't wander off too far!
I'm going outside now. I'm bored.

144
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,960
Oh, don't wander off too far!

145
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,960
Hello there, little lady.

146
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,590
Be a good girl for just a little bit.

147
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,260
Once your maid pays up, we'll let you go.

148
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,510
Bad guys!

149
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,770
Eden has bullying and kidnappings...

150
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,480
She was right!

151
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,940
I heard you can even sell their
uniforms for a sweet price.

152
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,150
Excellent. In that case,
little lady, let's take yourâ

153
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,610
What do you think you're doing?

154
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,120
Uh-oh! Looks like we're gonna have
to tack on some medical bills, too.

155
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,080
Let's see your wallet, Miss Hired Help.

156
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,960
I'm afraid I used up all of
my cash, so I have none left.

157
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,960
So I must ask you to leave.

158
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,300
I see. Then I guess we're just gonna
have to strip the little lady.

159
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,430
You're gonna be fired anyway,

160
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,810
so go back to the countryside,
you shitty little maid!

161
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,190
Sh-She destroyed that pumpkin
with her bare hand?!

162
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,240
I am that girl's mother!

163
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:40,820
If you do not want to end up like
that vegetable, leave at once!

164
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,870
Mama...

165
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,120
Are you all right?

166
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,920
I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have
let you out of my sight.

167
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,170
There, there...

168
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,410
And I've ruined all of the ingredients...

169
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,760
I'm such a failure as a mother.

170
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,270
But I love that my Mama
is so strong and cool.

171
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,310
There, there.

172
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,310
Killer punch, kapow!

173
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,770
I-I'm so embarrassed!

174
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:13,650
Mama!

175
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,150
Train me, please!

176
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,900
T-Train you?

177
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:22,070
I know it's really dangerous to
be an Eden student now.

178
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:26,540
But it won't be as scary if I train!

179
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,370
I can do my best at school without dying!

180
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,000
I wanna be like you, Mama!

181
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,960
Even if I can't be like a normal mother,

182
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,590
I'm going to do everything I can for her.

183
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,180
All right. Let's go straight
home and start your training.

184
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,010
Training!

185
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,360
I'm home...

186
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,850
Hah! Hah!

187
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,230
What are you doing?

188
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,730
Preparing her to go to school!

189
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,730
Hah!

190
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,780
Yeah... I'm filled with nothing but anxiety.

191
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,450
You are truly the chosen.

192
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:13,460
Due to your hard work, or perhaps your parents,

193
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,960
you have made it to the
hallowed halls of Eden.

194
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,880
To our honorable new 228 students...

195
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,300
Congratulations, and welcome to our school.

196
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,810
Everyone here at Eden welcomes you
from the bottom of our hearts.

197
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,010
We finally made it this far...

198
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,270
Papa, a lot of people are
wearing the same thing I am.

199
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,520
Yes. That's what a uniform is.

200
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,070
I still have a mountain of
problems to tackle, but...

201
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,440
Listen up, Twilight.

202
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,820
There are requirements to attend
Desmond's social gathering.

203
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,240
The student must be an Imperial Scholar.

204
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,580
And for that to happen, they
must receive plenty of merits.

205
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:56,840
Do not forget that the future of the
East and West depends on this mission.

206
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,960
Turning this child into an elite...

207
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,590
I've mostly given up on that task.

208
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,550
Shock!

209
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,930
This school is already filled
with the best of the best.

210
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,720
It'll be difficult to maintain a top position.

211
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,640
More importantly...

212
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:15,810
Next, we will announce the houses
and their housemasters.

213
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,020
Please come forward when
your name is called.

214
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,650
Class one: Specter Hall.

215
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,150
William Howard.

216
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
Theodore Russell.

217
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,990
Grace Fein.

218
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,200
Jessica Clark.

219
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,450
Next, we have class two: Cline Hall.

220
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,330
I wonder what class I'm gonna be in.

221
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,750
Who knows?

222
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,460
Lucy Garrett.

223
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,620
Actually... I do.

224
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,880
Because I changed parts of the
lineups to help with my mission.

225
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,630
To ensure that Anya...

226
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,800
would be in the same class as him.

227
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,600
The second son of my target,
Donovan Desmond...

228
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,560
Damian.

229
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,070
That's Lord Damian to you.

230
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,360
He got into Eden just
like his older brother.

231
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,740
I've had my eye on him ever since I saw
his name on the list of students applying.

232
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,200
If plan A to get Anya to become an
Imperial Scholar proves too difficult,

233
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,240
we'll go to plan B.

234
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,330
I call it... the Friendship Scheme.

235
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,540
Step one: be in the same class
as him and become friends.

236
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,670
Step two: be invited to his
house and bring me along.

237
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,750
Step three: direct contact with the target!

238
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,970
I'm sure it won't actually go that easily,

239
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,510
but the more insurance we have, the better.

240
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,510
Go ahead.

241
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,270
Anya must have grown up around kids
her age at the orphanage for years.

242
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,520
I'll put my faith in her
communication skills.

243
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,440
That's the evil boss's kid.

244
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,280
What's with her?

245
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,770
Heh, I see.

246
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,320
She's already realized how
amazing I am and fallen for me.

247
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,490
You've got good taste, kid.

248
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,870
Playing hard to get, I see. Cute.

249
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,040
Becky Blackbell.

250
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,830
Geh...

251
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,790
Pleasure to meet you!

252
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,260
That's...

253
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,680
The daughter of the CEO of the major
military contractor, Blackbell.

254
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,970
What?! And behind her is the daughter
of the vice president of parliament!

255
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,810
And among the boys, there's the son of one
of the key members of the secret service!

256
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,770
Her classmates are a
treasure trove of intel!

257
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,650
Make sure you become friends
with all of them, Anya!

258
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,140
Loid gets so worked up when
it comes to his daughter.

259
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,860
I'm Becky! What's your name?

260
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,780
She looks like a baby. I guess I wouldn't
mind taking care of her a bit.

261
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:33,870
Hmph.

262
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,370
Those will be the 29 students in class three.
Hmph.

263
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,200
Hey!
Those will be the 29 students in class three.

264
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,240
Hello?!
Those will be the 29 students in class three.

265
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,540
Those will be the 29 students in class three.

266
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,710
And you will be under the
tutelage of Master Henderson.

267
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,670
Oh, it's the nice teacher.

268
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,790
So he didn't get fired after all.

269
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,630
I feel it's unfair for a housemaster
to have to teach new students,

270
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,380
but I guess it could've been much worse.

271
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,800
I'll just have to whip these rugrats
into shape like I used to.

272
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:59,240
And now, the new students will accompany their
homeroom teachers on a tour of the campus,

273
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,520
then head to their
respective classrooms.

274
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:09,230
During that time, there will be a meet and
greet in Tower C's lounge for the guardians.

275
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,780
Do your best, Anya.

276
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,030
You'll be on your own from here on out.

277
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,900
Okey-dokey!

278
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,130
You there! Stay in line!

279
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,330
I'm so worried...

280
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,630
It is always nerve-racking to send
them off into the world.

281
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,750
I totally understand.

282
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,920
This is the dining hall.

283
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,930
The best chefs will present you with
the most elegant dishes daily.

284
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:38,560
Beyond those doors is a special dining
hall reserved only for Imperial Scholars.

285
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:44,650
Anyone can become an Imperial Scholar if they
achieve elegant grades and earn eight Stella.

286
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,110
I trust that you will all do your best.

287
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,150
Yes, sir!

288
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,440
However, those who fall behind

289
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,490
will receive Tonitrus Bolts and face
punishment or expulsion, so stay on your toes.

290
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,410
Why are you looking at me?

291
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,580
Lord Damian's gonna be an
Imperial Scholar in no time!

292
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,910
Of course I am.

293
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,540
We'd expect nothing else!

294
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,580
I mean, my father is the head
of the National Unity Party.

295
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,080
Wait, really?!

296
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,920
Wow!
Wait, really?!

297
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,000
My Papa says we owe a lot
to the Desmond Group!

298
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,460
Silence! No private conversations!

299
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,720
They're so dumb.

300
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,560
What about you? What does your father do?

301
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,930
If he's important enough, I'd consider
letting you be my friend, too.

302
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,270
I will stay calm for the mission.

303
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,690
He's a spâa feelings doctor.

304
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,740
Hmph. So he's just a nobody.

305
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,700
You're probably not that rich, either. Lame.

306
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,910
I wanna go play at your house.

307
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,660
You moron! Know your place, uggo!

308
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,950
This is the problem with
measly little peasants.

309
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,460
You're gonna get your gross
peasant germs on him! Scram!

310
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,130
Now is the time for me to
unleash my killer punch!

311
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,710
Listen carefully, Miss Anya.

312
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,460
Gasp!

313
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,170
Anyone who lets their
emotions control their fists

314
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,300
does not know the meaning of true strength.

315
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,140
If someone's just being a little mean,

316
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,850
being able to laugh it off
makes you the cooler, bigger girl.

317
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,430
A big girl!

318
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:07,550
And if you can keep a smile on
your face, fights will not happen.

319
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:11,520
Hey, stop being so pathetic.
At least say something back.

320
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,530
Heh. Like I care.

321
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,490
Heh.

322
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,990
H-How dare she smirk at me
like she's mocking me?!

323
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,460
Look at that composure!
She's so mature! Amazing!

324
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,750
I was wrong about her being a baby!

325
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,290
You're way more grown-up than
I thought. I'm impressed.

326
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,630
I'm a grown-up?

327
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:38,760
Heh.

328
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,850
Don't get cocky, you stupid uggo!

329
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,770
Uggo, uggo, Queen Uggo!

330
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,390
Lord Damian, perhaps you should
broaden your vocabulary...

331
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:48,890
What's your problem?

332
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,270
Sure, she's uglier than me,
but you don't have to be so mean.

333
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,650
Shut your mouth!

334
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,900
You there! How many times must I warn you?

335
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,150
Do you want punishments on your first day?

336
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,410
Curse you... How dare you
embarrass me like that?!

337
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,620
You'll pay for this!

338
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,580
Mama, you liar. Smiling didn't help at all.

339
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,670
If you don't quit it,
I'm gonna tell the teacher!

340
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,090
What? You have proof that we did it?

341
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,430
Yeah, yeah!

342
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,180
Go on. Move!

343
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,390
Hey, you smug uggo!

344
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:29,730
I'm gonna bully you every single day!

345
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,280
I'm gonna teach you a lesson so you'll
never be able to smirk again!

346
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,690
Her feelings doctor father might
be able to fix her if she cries.

347
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,400
Seriously? Well, that's impressive!

348
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,760
Aren't you a special widdle girl?

349
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,840
Hey, where do you think
you're looking? You scared?

350
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,090
What is the meaning of this?!

351
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,260
Sir! She just punched Lord Damian!

352
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,640
I just reached out my hand ,
and somehow, he ran into it.

353
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,560
You liar! You're not fooling anyone!

354
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,810
You were even making sure the
teacher wasn't looking earlier!

355
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,270
You got any proof I did it?

356
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,530
You left the imprint of
your fist on his face!

357
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,030
I trust you are aware that
perjury is a disgraceful act,

358
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,780
Anya Forger.

359
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,280
That's not what happened, sir!

360
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,870
She was holding back all day,
but these bullies just...

361
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,250
So it's true that she hit him?

362
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,050
Listen carefully, Miss Anya.

363
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:38,800
Gasp!

364
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,220
The only time it's all right for
you to use force is, for example,

365
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,180
if you're saving a friend in trouble.

366
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,180
H-Her foot...

367
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,600
He stepped on it.

368
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,150
So I got mad...

369
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,230
I'm sorry.

370
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,860
She did that for me?!

371
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,190
Oh, Anya!

372
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,490
She held back her own personal anger,

373
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:09,990
and had the courage to stand
up to a lad for her friend.

374
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,410
Truly elegant, Anya Forger.

375
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,580
But I'm afraid...

376
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,750
So the Desmonds didn't appear after all.

377
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,010
Well, there's no need to rush.

378
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,090
Now that she's enrolled,
we have all the time in the world.

379
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,930
And I was able to make some connections.

380
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,440
Where's Anya?

381
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,480
Forger.

382
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,270
Come with me.

383
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,900
She punched a boy?

384
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,740
And it just happened to be Desmond's son?

385
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,110
What in the world?

386
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,910
But at my discretion, it became one.

387
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,500
That is as much as I can do.

388
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:57,180
I'm terribly sorry, Loid!
All because I trained her...

389
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:00,670
I will speak with his parents, too.

390
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,840
It's the first day of school
and she lost a point.

391
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,820
To top it off, her relationship with
Damian couldn't be any worse.

392
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,300
All right, everyone! We're taking the picture!

393
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,960
The family on the right over there!
Smile a little more!

394
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,800
Say, "Cheese!"
