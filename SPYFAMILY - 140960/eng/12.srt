1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,980
The capitol of Ostania, Berlint.

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:12,650
This old woman is a contact for
Westalis's intelligence agency, WISE.

3
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,010
This man's name is Loid Forger,

4
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,260
otherwise known by his code name, Twilight.

5
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,390
His occupation: spy.

6
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,390
It appears as though, on top of the current
important mission he is conducting,

7
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,940
he's been given another.

8
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,370
This has been my life for decades now.

9
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,790
Every day remains the same,
and peace is fleeting.

10
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,460
Will we ever see a day

11
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,210
when we're not needed anymore?

12
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,910
Mission complete.

13
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,790
Good day, or perhaps, good evening, Twilight.

14
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,080
We thank you for completing
that mission so quickly.

15
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,420
How goes Operation Strix?

16
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:22,010
That is his top-priority mission to maintain
peace between the East and the West.

17
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,140
That mission...

18
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,720
It's going smoothly.

19
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,930
I have secured both a wife and child.

20
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,150
...is meant to bring the enemy
country's plans for war to light,

21
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,480
establish a family in said country,
and infiltrate a certain academy.

22
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,910
Very good. Not standing out is
an iron-clad rule for a spy.

23
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,490
Continue acting as a
completely mundane family.

24
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,790
I know.

25
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,830
Did you quit smoking?

26
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,460
Well, I have a child now.

27
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,840
And thus, the Forgers came
to be without issue, but...

28
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,380
Loid did mention that he
was going to be late,

29
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,590
so why don't we eat out tonight?

30
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,350
Yep.

31
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:11,100
Doctors sure are busy. It must be difficult.

32
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,810
Papa is not actually a doctor.

33
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,730
His daughter, Anya, whom he just happened
to adopt from an orphanage...

34
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,400
Papa's real job is a spy.

35
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,200
Today, he went to take down an arms dealer.

36
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,620
...is an Esper who can read minds.

37
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,950
I bring you my dish!

38
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,460
Thank you very much, Miss Anya.

39
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,710
Hmm... It's just not washing off...

40
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,710
His wife, Yor, who agreed to this arrangement
because of a common interest...

41
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,220
I can still smell the blood
from yesterday's kill.

42
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,260
...is a hardcore assassin.

43
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,850
A spy, a telepath, and an assassin.

44
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,640
The three decided to live under one roof

45
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,400
for their own reasons while
concealing their true identities,

46
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,650
and so their less-than-mundane
family life continues on.

47
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,360
I keep getting all these extra missions
every day, on top of Operation Strix.

48
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,080
HQ must be in dire straits
over the personnel shortage.

49
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,660
When I get home, I have my
pretend family to deal with.

50
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,080
I am an agent. Therefore,
my soul has no time to rest.

51
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,760
Hey, don't you think the husband
across the hall must be in trouble?

52
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,930
It's supposed to be a day off, but he's
working late into the night again.

53
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,930
They're our neighbors...

54
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,100
And they have a little child.
That poor, neglected thing.

55
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,060
I rarely see the three of them together.

56
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,190
He's probably off cheating somewhere!

57
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,500
How awful!

58
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,700
Maybe he actually got fired,
and he can't bring himself to go home.

59
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,620
I was careless.

60
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,700
I was so consumed by my other missions

61
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,250
that I neglected playing
the role of the father well.

62
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,790
Even the slightest suspicion or mistrust
from those around us in a deception operation

63
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,920
can be detrimental.

64
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,670
I must do everything I can
to remedy this situation.

65
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,300
A threat to our family is
a threat to the world!

66
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,300
We're going out next weekend!

67
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,310
The three of us will have a good time.
Where do we want to go?

68
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,810
Oh? Is that a penguin, Anya?

69
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,070
I know. Let's go to the aquarium.

70
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,820
Um... You seem exhausted.
Why not get some rest?

71
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,990
Yor, in order for our pretend
marriage to continue,

72
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,000
we must do everything we can to
seem like a normal, happy family.

73
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,580
So look forward to the weekend!

74
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,830
So exciting!

75
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,300
I need to take care of all of
my other missions before then.

76
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,100
Well... let's go.

77
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,850
Loid, perhaps you really
should get some rest.

78
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,190
I'm perfectly fine.

79
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,610
Oh, if it isn't the Forgers.

80
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,860
It's so rare to see all of you together.

81
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,490
We're about to go enjoy some
time together at the aquarium.

82
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,120
Isn't that exciting, Anya?

83
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,370
I see...

84
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,500
We need to show our neighbors
what a happy family we are

85
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,630
so they don't ever suspect
that we're a pretend family.

86
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,710
My papa, who is taking us on an ooting,

87
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,220
and my mama, who is very kind to
my papa, are both very good people.

88
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,630
I think our family is completely normal.

89
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,720
That sounded more like an explanation
than anything else, but good enough.

90
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:40,390
Now, then...

91
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,020
If you'll excuse us.

92
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,110
Please wait, Papa, who is a
very good and normal person!

93
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,820
Ba-donk ka-chonk!

94
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,530
Another summons?
I have a bad feeling about this.

95
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,120
I'm going to go buy us some drinks.

96
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,910
All right.

97
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,380
Agent Twilight, we've got another
additional mission for you tod—

98
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,630
I cannot.

99
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,140
This is straight from WISE HQ—

100
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,470
I cannot. Today is a very
important day for Operation Strix.

101
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,640
Papa!

102
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,310
We need to hurry, or the
aquarium will go out of business!

103
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,610
Don't worry, they just remodeled the place.

104
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,650
Just wait patiently.

105
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,780
There you have it.

106
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,860
Anyway, I'll take one coffee, one juice—

107
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,410
Hang on! Did you say "aquarium"?

108
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,120
Splendid, Agent Twilight.

109
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,000
The location of this mission just
happens to be Berlint Aquarium!

110
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,790
I am blown away at how prepared you are!

111
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,670
No, really. This was a coincidence.

112
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,630
Could I get that coffee and juice now?

113
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,750
There will be some intel
traded at the aquarium—

114
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,930
My coffee and juice, please.

115
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,840
Listen to me carefully, Twilight.

116
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,600
This intel contains instructions from another
country for making a new chemical weapon.

117
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,170
If terrorists get their
hands on this information,

118
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,440
many will perish in our country!

119
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,450
So many... fishies!

120
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,990
An octopus!

121
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,110
Starfish.

122
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,740
A tiny shark!

123
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,910
She looks like she's having fun.

124
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,450
Loid...

125
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,620
You look so pale. Are you all right?

126
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,540
I ended up taking the mission.

127
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,760
But we did successfully show the
neighbors how well we get along.

128
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,470
As long as I can get through
this separate mission...

129
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,970
Oh, if it isn't the Forgers
from across the hall.

130
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,470
What a coincidence.

131
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
Oh, hello.

132
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,390
You can't... be serious!

133
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,730
We just got here, too.

134
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,190
Now I definitely can't relax.

135
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,480
Actually, we just need
to shoo them off, and—

136
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,360
Would you like to join us?

137
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,860
Yor!

138
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,110
What a great idea.

139
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,950
Papa is funny.

140
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
If we want to appear normal,

141
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,700
we need to keep up a good
relationship with our neighbors.

142
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,210
Very well, then.

143
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,420
I'll take care of this mission immediately,
and then return to weekend mode.

144
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,000
According to our intel,

145
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,340
they smuggled in a capsule containing
film by making a penguin swallow it.

146
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,010
Why a penguin?

147
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,430
It was brought in sometime
yesterday at an unknown time.

148
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,600
The recipient has not appeared yet.

149
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,100
You must retrieve the goods before the
enemy organization does, no matter what!

150
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,020
Why don't we check out the penguin exhibit?
It seems to be the main attraction.

151
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,230
Okay.

152
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,780
I like penguins! I wanna see!

153
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:43,370
Welcome to the world's biggest penguin park!

154
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,870
P-P-P-Penguins!

155
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,870
Our most recommended
attraction at this aquarium

156
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,580
is our adorable underwater show
that stars 200 penguins!

157
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,960
Exactly which penguin is my target?
is our adorable underwater show

158
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,380
Exactly which penguin is my target?

159
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,630
There's no time to check
each and every penguin.

160
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:01,260
I'd have a better chance of stopping the
terrorist from obtaining the film...

161
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:06,310
No... Since I don't know when
the recipient is going to show up,

162
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,560
that'll be difficult, as well.

163
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:12,690
I won't be able to keep an eye
on all of these penguins alone.

164
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,150
What am I going to do?

165
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,900
There has to be something...

166
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,700
They must've marked the penguin somehow
to tell it apart from the others.

167
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,320
Papa is troubled.

168
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,160
Loid is so enthusiastic. I guess he lets
his inner child out sometimes, too.

169
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,790
Hey, that fish looks tasty.

170
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,040
Wait, where did my kid go?!
Hey, that fish looks tasty.

171
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,340
Wait, where did my kid go?!

172
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:34,840
I hope my girlfriend stops being so angry.
Wait, where did my kid go?!

173
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,170
I hope my girlfriend stops being so angry.

174
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:47,180
It's hard to read the minds of penguins.

175
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,440
Papa, that penguin looks like it can't breathe.

176
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,320
It's drinking a lot of water
only to spit it all back out.

177
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,700
It's possible there's something
stuck in its throat.

178
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,950
This is definitely worth investigating.

179
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,160
Sorry. I'm going to go buy
some drinks real quick.

180
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,330
Loid... His exhaustion must
be making him so thirsty.

181
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,960
Hey! Where's the new guy
we're supposed to get today?

182
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,760
He's this late on his first day?

183
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,800
Sorry I'm late!

184
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,390
What's wrong with you young'uns today?

185
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,470
I'll show you how to feed
the penguins. Follow me.

186
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,470
Yes, sir!

187
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,600
The fastest way to get closer to the target
penguin without causing a commotion

188
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,230
is to disguise myself as
one of the aquarists.

189
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,990
The first thing a newbie has to learn
is all of the penguins' faces and names.

190
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,700
Did you memorize the roster?

191
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,000
Yes. I glanced through it
quickly in the staff room.

192
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,210
You glanced through? You moron!

193
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,830
Even with me, it took two
years to learn all 200...

194
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,420
Oh, Chief. You're about to step
on poor Petilda behind you.

195
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,510
This is indeed Petilda.

196
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,510
This one is Pemas, and this is Pescar.

197
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,520
How can you tell, newbie?

198
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:16,440
Huh? Well, all of their patterns
are completely different.

199
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,770
Their faces and heights, too.

200
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,980
Even I still mistake them
every once in a while.

201
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,790
I can't believe this guy's
observation skills and memory.

202
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,990
All right, then. Let's get to feeding them.

203
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,950
This way.

204
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,790
The penguin I spotted earlier is...

205
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,790
Right there. Parles, the emperor penguin.

206
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,630
I need to get to him immediately and...

207
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,460
Wh-Wha?!

208
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,800
I-I can't go any further.

209
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,220
We've got big eaters and fussy eaters.

210
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,350
Each penguin has unique
eating habits, so pay attention.

211
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,930
I don't have time for this.

212
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,020
I need to hurry back, or the
neighbors will be suspicious.

213
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,810
Chief!

214
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,770
Allow me to do the honors!

215
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,560
What?

216
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,570
I figured this out watching
veteran aquarists...

217
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,570
The most important thing
is how each penguin eats.

218
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,320
How much they eat, what kind of food it is,

219
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,660
and where each group is located.

220
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,490
As long as I can figure these things out...

221
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,090
Controlling the masses is mere child's play.

222
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,960
That's no ordinary newbie!

223
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,300
Uh-oh. Apparently Parles isn't very hungry.

224
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,930
He might be sick, so I'll take
him to the treatment room.

225
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,190
If you'll excuse me for a bit.

226
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,730
S-Sure...

227
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,730
Sorry, little guy.

228
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,820
Bingo! There's something
stuck in his throat.

229
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,780
Upon closer observation, it seems there's
a mark on the bottom of his foot, too.

230
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,000
Just a second, little guy.
I'll get it out for you.

231
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,500
You there.

232
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,750
What are you planning to
do with that penguin?

233
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,260
He's not feeling well, so I'm
taking him to the treatment room.

234
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,880
I see. Allow me to do that for you.

235
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,430
I'm terribly sorry. Only staff
are allowed to handle them.

236
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,760
My apologies.

237
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:22,690
I'm a professor from Berlint University's
marine biology research lab.

238
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,770
I'm in charge of the marine animals here.

239
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,830
This ID is fake.

240
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,290
It's not even well-made.

241
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,540
Who do you work for, you—

242
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,000
You're not getting away!

243
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,840
Hey, be still!

244
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,880
Hey, newbie!

245
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,550
Where are you taking that penguin?

246
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,390
The treatment room is that way!

247
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,970
I can't carelessly let him go without
knowing how many enemies are here.

248
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,770
My top priority is retrieving this film.

249
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,060
I'll have to give up on chasing after him.

250
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,740
Oh, no... Now where did
Miss Anya run off to?

251
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:18,120
I need to let my comrades
outside know to kill that man,

252
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,450
and retrieve the film—

253
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,000
Who the hell are you?!

254
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Mama! I'm being kidnapped!
Who the hell are you?!

255
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,960
Mama! I'm being kidnapped!

256
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,750
Miss Anya?!

257
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,500
Let go of me!

258
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,880
What are you talking ab—

259
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,630
What do you think...

260
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,220
you're doing to my daughter?!

261
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,470
Wow.

262
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,970
Are you all right?

263
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,980
Oh, no. I definitely overdid it.

264
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,940
I hope he's not dead...

265
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,480
Wow.

266
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,530
And so, Twilight was able to retrieve the film

267
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,150
and get information about the enemy
organization from the man they captured.

268
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,740
You know, your husband
hasn't come back at all.

269
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,910
I'm telling you, he's cheating!

270
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,000
How awful!

271
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,870
Huh? That's not...

272
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,170
I'm sorry I took so long!

273
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,250
Loid!

274
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,630
Ta-da!

275
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,130
A penguin!

276
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,000
Oh, what a big stuffed penguin!
Where did you get it?

277
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:18,260
It was a prize from the penguin name-guessing
challenge they were doing over there.

278
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:22,930
I just had to get it for Anya,
so I kept trying over and over.

279
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,520
Boy, it sure was difficult.

280
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:29,770
Papa is a liar. He actually got it in one try.

281
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,780
He got so worked up. How adorable.

282
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,280
You're a better father than I thought.

283
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,780
I'm impressed.

284
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,950
You flatter me.

285
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,160
I'm just a simple father trying
not to stumble around too much

286
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,040
It's bigger than you, Miss Anya.
I'm just a simple father trying
not to stumble around too much

287
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,290
as I protect my happy little family.

288
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,800
Now that I've gotten a closer look
at you, you're quite handsome.

289
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,140
Looks like things are going
to work out here, too.

290
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,850
But I'm absolutely done with
all this excessive overwork.

291
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:07,810
I'm going to file a complaint to
HQ and request a long vaca—

292
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,820
No...

293
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,200
Maintaining a world where
children don't cry...

294
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,490
A world with no war...

295
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,610
That is my duty.

296
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,410
I have no time to stand by idly.

297
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,290
Papa! The dolphin show is gonna start!

298
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,330
Sorry, could you walk a little slower?

299
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,790
What?! You want me to be the chief?!

300
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,170
But why?!

301
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,220
I have nothing more to teach you.

302
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:47,770
I am Director Chimera, the boss
of the secret organization P2.

303
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,310
So you're the new recruit, eh?

304
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:54,940
I am called Penguin, please,
and I come from the aquarium.

305
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,150
It is a pweasure to meet
your acquaintenance.

306
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,940
Indeed.

307
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,160
Agent Anya, you know what to do.

308
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,870
Yep!

309
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,210
We have a ritual in which we both
eat the halves of a split peanut.

310
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,050
Once you have completed this task,

311
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,230
you will be officially recognized
as a member of this organization.

312
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:23,760
Om...

313
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,100
Starting today, you will be
known as Agent Penguinman.

314
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,390
Do your best for peace.

315
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,480
Yep.

316
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,150
Agent Anya, show our new
agent around our hideout.

317
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,610
Okey-dokey!

318
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,370
This is our hideout's command room.

319
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,620
We gather intel from this machine every day.

320
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:57,300
This is Agent Papa. He is a
super-elite that can do anything.

321
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,760
Um... what? Is she pretending to be a spy?

322
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,930
This is Agent Mama.

323
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,100
She's strong, but fails at everything else.

324
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,010
Am I that much of a failure?!

325
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,390
They are Anya's trusted lackeys.

326
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,690
Okay, onward to the next spot.

327
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,190
It looks like Miss Anya has taken
quite a liking to that plushie.

328
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,200
Mm...

329
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,660
This is the bathroom!

330
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,500
You can heal your wounds from battle here.

331
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:39,210
This is Anya's room. I train in here every day.

332
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,300
And...

333
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,050
The most top-secret spots in our hideout.

334
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,520
Papa's room and Mama's room!

335
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,270
Be on your guard.

336
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,760
If you discover the secret of
these rooms, you won't leave alive.

337
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,800
We might find the ultimate knife,
or the ultimate bomb!

338
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,300
Now, then...

339
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,250
Hey! What do you think you're doing?!

340
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,040
How many times have I told you not
to go in there without permission?!

341
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,550
Er, it's just, there's a lot of dangerous things
in there, like scissors and heaters.

342
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,940
Honestly, there are far more
dangerous things in there.

343
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,020
Yes, you shouldn't go in mine, either.

344
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,520
My room has poisoned needles and such.

345
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,320
Papa and Mama, I hate you both!

346
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,510
Anya's gonna run away from home!

347
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:42,430
Not good. At this rate,
Operation Strix is going to collapse!

348
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,440
What should I do?

349
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,760
A-Agent Anya!

350
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,400
There's no time for crying!
World peace is on the line!

351
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:58,410
L-Let's wrap up the tour of the hideout
and head out for our next mission!

352
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:02,730
Y-Yes! Let's go beat the bad guys!

353
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,600
Okay! Follow me, you two!

354
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,800
The bad guys have taken over
the candy store on 2nd Street.

355
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,210
Let's go save them!

356
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,000
Huh?

357
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,190
Be careful.

358
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:20,550
The enemy might have set traps.

359
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:20,790
W-Well done, Agent Anya.

360
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,130
What is that?
W-Well done, Agent Anya.

361
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:22,690
W-Well done, Agent Anya.

362
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,690
Aw, what a sweet family.

363
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:29,010
A spy must not stand out...

364
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,200
Later on, Anya's mood improved
after they bought her a snack,

365
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,370
and peace was restored
to the Forger household.
