1
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,910
Yeah, no.

2
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,040
What?!

3
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,660
Anya cannot accept this mama.

4
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,600
You're just not going to cut it
for the mother role, Franky.

5
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,610
You're literally a spy. Couldn't you
have done my disguise better?

6
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,090
There's only so much I can do
with your height and physique.

7
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,500
I can't believe I volunteered for this!

8
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,780
Operation Strix.

9
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,150
In order to stop a key figure in Ostania,
Desmond, from trying to start a war,

10
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,270
I was given this top-secret
mission as a member of WISE.

11
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,980
We were able to pass the written exam to
get into the prestigious Eden College,

12
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,470
but who knew the interview process's next stage
demanded the attendance of both parents?

13
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,490
Very well.

14
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,500
I guess I'll have to explore my options.

15
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,730
Did you hear? A thief
might've entered our office.

16
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:25,320
Apparently, they only searched drawers
with information regarding the girls.

17
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,990
Like, what? What kind of creep does that?

18
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,670
Honestly, the section chief is way creepier.

19
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,320
He's always ogling me.

20
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,900
That's because you're always
wearing those short skirts.

21
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,720
Well, my boyfriend likes
it when I wear them.

22
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,750
You've got a nice figure yourself,
Sharon, so flaunt it more.

23
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,780
You don't bother anymore
once you have a kid.

24
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,950
So hey...

25
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,130
What do you think about this,
Yor? Isn't it creepy?

26
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:50,940
Sorry?

27
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,560
Is that the section chief's coffee?
Let's put some boogers in it.

28
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,450
Huh?

29
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,320
Do boogers somehow make it taste better?

30
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,540
You know, Yor... I've gotta
say you're rather...

31
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,400
unique.

32
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,240
I know, right?

33
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,040
She's so out there that I bet
guys keep their distance.

34
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,170
Come on, now, Millie.

35
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,180
You've got a nice face and body, Yor.

36
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,100
You'd be a knockout if you just dressed up.

37
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,790
Uh-huh...

38
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,920
I'll give you the deets on some
of my favorite cosmetics.

39
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,180
I'm honestly content as long
as I get to keep this job.

40
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,220
But aren't you, like, 27?
You need to be careful.

41
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,710
There seem to be a lot of spies
around lately, you know?

42
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,230
So people are apparently getting
reported over the tiniest things.

43
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,570
The other day, a single
woman in her late twenties

44
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:42,780
got reported by her neighbors
for being suspicious.

45
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,270
Wait, what? That's hilarious.

46
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,500
You know everything, Camilla.

47
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,420
True, it's unheard of to be single
at that age. Very suspicious.

48
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,320
Oh, I see. Thank you for the warning.

49
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,190
Oh, yeah. I'm having a party
at my place this weekend.

50
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,480
You should totally come, Yor.

51
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,500
Make sure you bring your partner with you.

52
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,680
Isn't that asking a bit much?

53
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,480
Maybe the creeper who snuck into
this place will go with her.

54
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,310
That's <i>so</i> mean!

55
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,770
Hello, Briar residence.

56
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,350
Hey, Sis. How have you been?

57
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,910
Oh, Yuri.

58
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,530
How's work going?

59
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,790
Don't worry. I'm still employed.

60
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,340
I'm worried about you.
You're kinda unusual, y'know.

61
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,860
How rude. I'm completely normal.

62
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,100
Isn't it about time you got married?

63
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,340
Anyone you're interested in?

64
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,890
This again?

65
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,750
The thing is, there's a chance
I might get promoted...

66
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,660
Meaning I'll probably be even busier
running around than before.

67
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,080
But I can't leave you alone like this,

68
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,760
so I'm not sure if I should take it.

69
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,970
The whole reason I got this far is
because of you, and I'm truly grateful.

70
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,020
That's why I just want you to be happy.

71
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,860
I know.

72
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,020
Thank you, Yuri.

73
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,110
If you want, I can introduce you to someone.

74
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,700
Huh? N-No, that's okay.

75
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,050
O-Oh, yes. I'm actually going
to a party this weekend.

76
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,610
With my partner, of course.

77
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,070
Huh? You have a boyfriend?

78
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,700
I do, actually...

79
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,360
So don't worry.

80
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,460
I see! That's great. It'll be a
party with coworkers, right?

81
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,030
Yup. Camilla's throwing it.

82
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,580
Ah.

83
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,200
Then I'll have to ask Dominic
about the guy later.

84
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,970
Huh?

85
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,480
I mean, I know how gullible you are.

86
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,030
I'll have to chase him away if he's a loser.

87
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,480
Huh? Um...

88
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,740
I'll hold off on this promotion
until I know he's a good guy.

89
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,300
Oh, you don't need to do tha—

90
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,830
I look forward to meeting him. Goodnight.

91
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,270
What should I do?

92
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,420
I need to find someone by
the time of the party.

93
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,600
If he finds out I'm lying, he'll think
I'm a weirdo and a pathological liar,

94
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,820
and he'll lose even more trust in me.

95
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,420
I need to find someone for the sake
of my little brother's promotion.

96
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,500
Yuri, you've got the wrong idea!
I was just joking earlier—

97
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,780
Oh, dear. Did you buddy-buddy
siblings actually have a quarrel?

98
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,200
Oh, Shopkeeper?

99
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,970
I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was you.

100
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,980
Good evening. I have a client
for you, Thorn Princess.

101
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,810
The Royal Hotel.

102
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,990
Room 1307.

103
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:33,350
Apologies, my lady. This whole
floor has been reserved.

104
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,570
Did anyone call for this chick?

105
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,590
Who knows?

106
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,460
But I've heard...

107
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,350
that a traitorous scumbag is staying here.

108
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,210
What in the world?!

109
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,270
It's an ambush! A lone woman—

110
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,210
Excuse me.

111
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,500
Vice Minister Brennan from the
auditing department, I presume?

112
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,230
I am terribly sorry if I
interrupted anything...

113
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,620
But may I have the honor
of taking your life?

114
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,240
Code name: Thorn Princess.

115
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,600
An assassin.

116
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,250
She was taught the skills of
her trade from a young age,

117
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,720
and has done any dirty work her
employer requested ever since.

118
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,850
It's not coming off.

119
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,670
Huh? Oh, no! What shall I do?

120
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,170
This is the only nice dress I own.

121
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,290
Now I can't go to the party.

122
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,310
Anyone you're interested in?

123
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,870
It's unheard of to be single at that age.

124
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,570
Make sure you bring your partner with you.

125
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,010
But it's hopeless.

126
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:50,470
When it comes to homemaking...
Cleaning is the only thing I can do.

127
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,330
Scruffy Head!

128
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,810
I copied all the files of
unmarried women from city hall.

129
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,070
Great, thanks.

130
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,840
You need one who won't care
you're divorced with a kid,

131
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,840
is refined enough for a prestigious school,

132
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,100
and is willing to get married within 48 hours?

133
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,050
If a goddess like that exists,
I'd sure love to meet her.

134
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,380
Meanwhile, I'm not picky at all,
yet I can't even get a date.

135
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,830
How unfortunate.

136
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,270
Don't pity me, asshole!

137
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,320
Is having a kid bad? Am I in the way?

138
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,870
You're not in the way at all.

139
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,010
Don't worry. Just go watch some TV.

140
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:26,610
'Kay.

141
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:38,540
Actually, why don't you just use
a female agent from your work?

142
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,650
A lot of them got caught in the recent
spy hunts, so I couldn't find a good match.

143
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,330
Selling people out is really in right now.

144
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,730
We don't have enough agents,
so I got another mission on top of this.

145
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,450
Eliminating a certain smuggling ring.

146
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,360
They're working you to the bone!

147
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,340
Let's just get this over with.

148
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,700
The quickest options would be women in
bad circumstances who'd cooperate with you.

149
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,480
Finding dirt on them might help, too.

150
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,360
If they don't have any,
we can always make some up.

151
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,710
I'd like to avoid anything risky.

152
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,850
Oh, please. She's plenty risky.

153
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,240
She definitely doesn't look like
any princess from a rich family.

154
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,780
You've got a point.

155
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,360
I need to at least do something
about her appearance.

156
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,370
Now, young lady, I'm going to take
your measurements. Come with me.

157
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,650
I'm being sold off somewhere!

158
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,570
You won't be if you behave.

159
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,670
Honestly, where does she
learn to talk like that?

160
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,500
The seamstress... is married.

161
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,420
The proprietress was listed
among the single women,

162
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:48,360
but she's been arrested once over
political activities, so she's too dangerous.

163
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,010
Finding the right person
might take longer than—

164
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,720
Pardon me.

165
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,000
Oh, I haven't seen you in a while, Yor.

166
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,620
Hello. I was hoping I could
get my dress fixed up.

167
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,610
Could I get it done as quickly as possible?

168
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,680
But of course. You're one of our regulars.

169
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,930
She managed to slip behind
me so easily. Who is she?

170
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,740
Yor... Yor...

171
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,550
There we go.

172
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,860
Yor Briar, 27 years old.

173
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,860
She has no record of being
married or divorced.

174
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,590
Both of her parents are deceased,

175
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,890
and she has one brother
who's much younger than her.

176
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,030
They're both civil servants
whose records are pretty clean.

177
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,370
Did I just let my guard down?

178
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,120
I'm far too relaxed lately.

179
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,900
Excuse me.

180
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:35,110
You've been staring at me ever
since I walked in. May I help you?

181
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,400
Impossible! She could even sense my gaze?

182
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,510
I was just admiring how pretty you are.

183
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,660
Does that mean...

184
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,700
You have a favorable impression
of my physical appearance?

185
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,700
Er, well... Yes.

186
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,260
You've got a nice face and body, Yor.

187
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,910
You'd be a knockout if you just dressed up.

188
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,010
Um—

189
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,040
Papa!

190
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,350
I now know how long I am!

191
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,310
Who's that?

192
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,490
Another customer.

193
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,940
He has a child.

194
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,330
I almost pursued someone's husband.

195
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,980
I've heard that women have been
killed by wives for such things.

196
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,900
I mean, if it happened to me,
I'd just kill them back...

197
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,590
Huh?

198
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,130
No, I mustn't.

199
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,480
If I think like this, someone will
eventually figure out that I'm an assassin.

200
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,640
I must learn to be more normal.

201
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,880
A-An assassin?!

202
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,510
A spy... An assassin...

203
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,830
I'm...

204
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,190
so excited!

205
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,630
The little girl was starving
for entertainment.

206
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:36,020
Hmm... I was considering her as a candidate
to play my wife, but never mind.

207
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,420
I was considering him to act
as my boyfriend at the party,

208
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,810
but I must avoid these so-called
messy lovers' quarrels.

209
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,580
Ah, I am oh so lonely because
I do not have a mama.

210
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,800
What brought this on?

211
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,930
I long for a mama.

212
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,900
Are you not with your wife?

213
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,570
Oh, er...

214
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,920
I actually lost my wife two years ago,

215
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,860
so I'm raising her on my own now.

216
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,170
So I won't be killed for
asking him to the party!

217
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,650
Excuse me...

218
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,940
Pretend to be your boyfriend?

219
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:18,310
Yes... I fibbed to my younger
brother about having a boyfriend.

220
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,470
If it's not too much trouble, I was
hoping you'd accompany me to this party.

221
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,610
Um, I promise I don't have
any ulterior motives!

222
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,570
Of course, I'll thank you properly, too.

223
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,940
I just want to put my brother's mind at ease.

224
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,370
Very well.

225
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,020
I accept.

226
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,970
Really?!

227
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,130
But I would like something in return.

228
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,160
So you see...

229
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,690
I'd like you to play the role of
her mother during the interview.

230
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,600
Her mother?

231
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,120
With the future being so
uncertain right now,

232
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,230
my only wish is for my daughter
to get into a good school.

233
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,460
This was also the wish of my late wife.

234
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,390
Papa is a liar.

235
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,250
What a wonderful person.

236
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,460
I'll have her accept something simple first,

237
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,490
but I'll get her to agree to
a formal marriage in the end.

238
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,730
Thank you. Then let us reconvene
at Saturday's party.

239
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,670
Yes.

240
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,270
I got a sitter for you on Saturday,
so make sure you behave.

241
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,990
Stock up on them peanuts!

242
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,690
Yeah, yeah.

243
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,880
Ten pents is your change, ribbit.

244
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,300
Thanks, ribbit.

245
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,120
Ribbit?

246
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,840
A T... no, an F cipher.

247
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,710
Must be the details on the extra mission.

248
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,680
Retrieving art pieces that were stolen from
the West and eliminating this smuggling ring.

249
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,720
I'm to carry out this mission Saturday at 1800
hours when the target meets with the buyer.

250
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,540
Saturday?

251
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,970
And so...

252
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,710
We're going to take care of this quickly
so I can make it to the party.

253
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,670
You're helping.

254
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,780
Hang on a second! I'm just an informant!
My fighting skills are literal trash!

255
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,270
Not to mention, you already
pretty much capped your tab—

256
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:15,940
We're talking 78 art pieces valued
at a total of three million dalcs.

257
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,930
I'm almost certain no one would notice
if one or two happened to go missing.

258
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,380
Leave it to me.

259
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,980
I just so happen to have invented some
new spy gear just for days like this.

260
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,100
He's so useful.

261
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,100
Loid is awfully late.

262
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,070
I hope he wasn't in some terrible accident.

263
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,350
Hold it!

264
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,480
Who're you workin' for?!

265
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,950
You didn't tell me there'd
be an army of them!

266
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,950
Two, four, six... 38 of them.

267
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,290
I can't afford to waste even
ten seconds on each one!

268
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,430
Reinforcements! There's no end to them.

269
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,280
I got 'em all in! Get in!

270
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,780
Whoo!

271
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,990
Let's see... Which one's going
to accidentally go missing?

272
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,870
I'm helping myself to this one.

273
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,730
Hey, that's a diamond! No fair
taking the expensive-looking one!

274
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,310
I'll use it as part of this whole charade.

275
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,620
Shut up! Give that back!

276
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,030
I see.

277
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,870
So this is what it means to
have your heart toyed with.

278
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:47,590
I must keep my work relationships
favorable for my brother's sake, too.

279
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,570
Which means that I must attend this party.

280
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,320
You're late, Yor!

281
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,680
I do apologize. Here's a gift.

282
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,900
Oh? I thought you were
coming with your boyfriend.

283
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,590
Unfortunately, he had something
suddenly come up.

284
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,700
Oh, what a <i>shame</i>. I was <i>so</i> eager to meet him!

285
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,770
What a lame excuse.

286
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,170
How pathetic.

287
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:17,460
I knew she was lying about having a guy.

288
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,210
Should we report the liar?

289
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,140
We should!

290
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:25,330
I'm positive she's a spy who's been sent
in to lower our country's birth rate.

291
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,150
Seriously? That's so petty.

292
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,310
She's just unpopular with the guys.

293
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,210
Just leave her be.

294
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:34,720
It's too bad your boyfriend couldn't
make it. I was excited to meet him.

295
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,520
D-Dominic...

296
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,260
Yuri's always so worried about you.

297
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,570
Um, could you possibly...

298
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,730
just tell my brother that I came
to the party with a kind gentleman?

299
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,720
Yeah, not happening.

300
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,830
Just how desperate are you
to impress people, Yor?

301
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,230
It just makes you look even more pathetic.

302
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,580
Jeez, knock it off, Camilla!

303
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,660
Stop talking to my man.

304
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:02,160
I'll be sure to let your brother
know that you came alone.

305
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,380
What could she possibly gain by doing that?

306
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,160
This is honestly becoming tiresome.

307
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,810
If all of the adults here
just happened to perish,

308
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,870
my brother would never find out...

309
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,770
I'm so sorry. Have fun!

310
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:21,570
Come on, Camilla. Help me bake this gratin.

311
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,030
And then that guy...

312
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,260
Mommy!

313
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,710
My oldest here will be taking
an entrance exam soon.

314
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,020
At the prestigious Eden College.

315
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,550
Wow, that's wonderful!

316
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,070
He'll be a shoo-in with the elite.

317
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,570
That must be what "normal" looks like.
He'll be a shoo-in with the elite.

318
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,620
That must be what "normal" looks like.

319
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:47,160
I'm sure that's how my
brother wanted me to end up.

320
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,150
Seriously? She's still here.

321
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,940
She's tougher than she looks.

322
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,030
I'm honestly surprised she had
the nerve to show up alone.

323
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:59,750
I see... I'm too out of my league here.

324
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,320
I do beg your pardon.

325
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,710
I will have to take my leav—

326
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,860
I'm terribly sorry for arriving late.

327
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,480
I'm Yor's husband, Loid Forger.

328
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,980
Um...

329
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,340
I just needed a boyfriend, not a husband.

330
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,410
Shit!

331
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,370
I mixed up my mission with hers.

332
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,230
Um... Mr. Forger, was it? You're bleeding.

333
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,530
Oh, pardon me.

334
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,200
One of my patients had a violent episode.

335
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,590
It happens all the time to a psychiatrist.

336
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,660
Have you been enjoying yourself, Yor?

337
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,670
You're joking, right?

338
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,160
You're married, Yor?

339
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,290
Why didn't you tell us?

340
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,970
Um, I...

341
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,560
It's embarrassing to say so, but this is my
second marriage and I already have a child,

342
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,480
so it may have been hard to bring up.

343
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,430
It's my fault.
Don't give me that shit!

344
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:51,350
There's absolutely no way Yor has a
husband who's that handsome and hot!

345
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,360
I'll embarrass her in front of everyone!

346
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,920
Yor, I just got this piping hot
gratin right out of the oven!

347
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,530
<i>Oops</i>, I seemed to have tripped!

348
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,360
I admire your dedication to not wasting food,

349
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,510
but it's a bit improper
to use your feet, Yor.

350
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,040
Oh, I'm so sorry.

351
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,140
<i>That</i> got you?

352
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,860
This is quite delicious.

353
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,800
Indeed.

354
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,300
Did you know, Mr. Ranger...

355
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,240
It's Forger.

356
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,210
...that she was apparently doing some
questionable work before working at city hall?

357
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,010
What did you do again?

358
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:28,980
Come on, stop it!
What did you do again?

359
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,390
Men would call you to their hotel rooms
so you could give them "massages"?
Come on, stop it!

360
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:33,010
Men would call you to their hotel rooms
so you could give them "massages"?

361
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,330
Oh, you little whore.

362
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,990
That was...

363
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:39,430
"Massages" were a cover
for occupational murders.

364
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,690
Um, please don't get the
wrong idea, Loid. I—

365
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,330
How wonderful.

366
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:44,990
Huh?

367
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,830
Yor lost her parents at a very young age.

368
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,330
She did all she could to care
for her younger brother,

369
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,060
even if it meant sacrificing herself.

370
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,300
Be it for someone else

371
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:00,790
or for a specific reason,
having to endure a merciless job

372
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,130
requires an incredible amount of dedication.

373
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,300
And that's something to be very proud of.

374
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,730
Let's go home, Yor.

375
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,310
Er, yes... Thank you for
the lovely party, everyone.

376
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,470
I-I'm so sorry I said I was your husband.

377
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,550
Oh, it's all right.

378
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,760
I'm not sure what to tell your
brother if he hears of this.

379
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:28,580
Um, Loid... I have a suggestion.

380
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,540
What...

381
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,660
Remnants of the smuggling ring?

382
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,750
Hang on, Yor!

383
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,530
Huh?

384
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,280
How did they know where I was?

385
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,330
Did they... leave a tracking
device in the art pieces?

386
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,050
You've definitely let your
guard down, Twilight.

387
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,990
Who are those people?

388
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,620
Um, uh...

389
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,840
I-It appears some of my
patients still haven't recovered

390
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,730
from their psychotic episodes.

391
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,300
Being a doctor must be very taxing.

392
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,620
She actually believed it!

393
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,460
In the meantime...

394
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,920
We're making a break for it.

395
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,370
They've abandoned the van.

396
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,980
They're probably hiding nearby.
Split up and find them.

397
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,730
Yor, this way. Hurry!

398
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:28,350
Um... Are you sure it's all right for
you to hit your patients like that?

399
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,720
Um, well...

400
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,410
The concussive recovery method is the
latest in modern medical practices.

401
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,380
I see.

402
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,970
I can't tell if she's
actually bright or dumb.

403
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,220
Look out, Yor!

404
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,150
Another one! I can't dodge it!

405
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,020
Oh, no!

406
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,570
I'm so sorry an amateur like me
helped with the recovery!

407
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,200
I happen to be an expert in self-defense.

408
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,140
My brother was kind enough to teach me...

409
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,130
Thank you, Yor.

410
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,530
That was quite impressive.
Did you see how far he went?

411
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,570
I'm sorry. I guess I did send him flying.

412
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,870
There he is!

413
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,750
This way!

414
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,870
Do whatever you need to do!
Make sure they're dead!

415
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,310
Um, Loid... This may not
be the best moment to ask,

416
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,300
but why don't we get married?

417
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,290
I'm sorry?!

418
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:40,850
Er, well, it would extend our agreement...

419
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:47,760
I mean... Apparently, I'm considered
suspicious just for being single,

420
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,830
so it'd be nice camouflage...

421
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,030
For me to continue my job
as an assassin, too.

422
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,840
Um, basically,

423
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:59,000
if it's all right with you,
maybe we could just stay together,

424
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,560
and not just for the interview...

425
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,870
For both our sakes.

426
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,390
He's probably the only person who could
accept me for who I am right now.

427
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,810
Then let's stop by city hall on our
way back to fill out the paperwork.

428
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,180
Huh? Right now?!

429
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,610
They do say no time like the present.

430
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,990
Oh, that's right.

431
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,890
Where did I drop it?

432
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,800
You bastard!

433
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,980
We have 'em cornered!

434
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,170
Fill 'em full of lead!

435
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,030
Yor...

436
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,810
Even in sickness,

437
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,590
or in sadness...

438
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,110
No matter what hardships await us,

439
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,600
let us be there for one another.

440
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,120
All right.

441
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,120
Until my mission...

442
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,120
Until my killing...

443
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,640
...do us part.
