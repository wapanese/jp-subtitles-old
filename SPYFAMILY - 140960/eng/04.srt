1
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,520
The time has come.

2
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,240
Let us check our personal effects.

3
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,080
All clear, sir.

4
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,580
And now, our appearances.

5
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,840
All clear, sir.

6
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,780
And a final check of our verbal etiquette.

7
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,530
All set, please. Will do my best, please.

8
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,100
I feel nothing but anxiety about this,

9
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,690
but we've done everything we could.

10
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,230
Now, onward...

11
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,390
To Eden College's interview!

12
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,550
It's so big!

13
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,440
Well, it is one of this country's top schools.

14
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,710
And there are so many examinees...

15
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,560
They're all our rivals.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,120
Anya, are you going to
be okay in this crowd?

17
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,490
I'll be okay, please.

18
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,430
Let us go, then.

19
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,290
This feeling...

20
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,690
There's no doubt about it.

21
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,580
I've experienced this many times.

22
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,820
Someone is watching us. Could it be...

23
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,820
Is there an enemy hidden in this crowd?

24
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,580
An enemy?

25
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,110
I feel someone's gaze...

26
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,550
No, that's not it.

27
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,920
I'm not the only one being watched.

28
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,180
It's always an unpleasant
feeling to be observed like this.

29
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,270
There.

30
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,960
Four in the overhead passage.

31
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,350
Four in the bell tower.

32
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,650
More in the buildings to the left and right.

33
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,240
I have information on most
of the staff at this school.

34
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,160
Those... are the instructors.

35
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:58,090
They're observing every action that
everyone is taking and scoring them

36
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,900
to see if they're worthy of this school.

37
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,130
Which means... the exam has already begun.

38
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,640
I need you two to be on your guard.

39
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,470
We're being watched by the examiners.

40
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,280
Huh?

41
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,040
We'll do this just as we practiced.

42
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,610
D-68, fail.

43
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,030
A-12, fail.

44
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,670
G-114, pass.

45
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,300
I must say, the examinees
this year lack refinement.

46
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,710
They all lack true elegance.

47
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,100
Good morning, Housemaster.

48
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,530
It displeases me to know their crude feet

49
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,190
are trudging upon the blessed
ground of our school.

50
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,160
Elegance creates tradition.

51
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,890
Elegance is what truly makes
this world a paradise.

52
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,500
Fail any family lacking
elegance immediately.

53
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,100
Yes, sir.

54
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,710
Hm?

55
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,950
Oho...

56
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,930
It appears that not all hope has been lost.

57
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,930
They are paying their respects
to the statue of our founder?!

58
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,670
I, Twilight, am a man of a thousand faces.

59
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,630
Becoming exactly the person my target
wants me to be is mere child's play.

60
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,660
Behold!

61
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,760
I haven't the slightest clue
as to who this gentleman is,

62
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,170
but everything should be fine as
long as I do what Loid is doing.

63
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,430
Baldy head!

64
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,280
S-So elegant!

65
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,520
How very elegant!

66
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,610
Who is that family?

67
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,280
K-212. They are the Forgers, sir.

68
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,710
Their daughter Anya just barely passed
the written exam with a score of 31.

69
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,770
Absolutely not elegant!
And such awful penmanship!

70
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,930
So the father has remarried?

71
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,670
Might they be an impromptu
family for admission purposes?

72
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,510
I am not certain. We must investigate.

73
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,810
We must ascertain whether
or not they have true elegance.

74
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,500
We'll confirm your admission numbers here.
We must ascertain whether
or not they have true elegance.

75
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
We'll confirm your admission numbers here.

76
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,480
G-114. Please go to Hall 1.

77
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,430
Ah, A-12. Please enter Hall 2.

78
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,630
I see they're wasting no
time with the screening.

79
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,940
K-212. Please head to Hall 1.

80
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,940
We're still being observed.
Don't let your guard down.

81
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,720
It's so nerve-racking
being watched like this...

82
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,790
I need to pick my nose.

83
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,920
Absolutely not.

84
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,560
I've accidentally fallen into
the gutter, and I can't get out!

85
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,620
Uh... That's too blatant if
they're trying to test us.
I've accidentally fallen into
the gutter, and I can't get out!

86
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,320
Uh... That's too blatant if
they're trying to test us.

87
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,330
Perhaps they're thinking
he might be a threat,

88
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,210
but no one is trying to go near him.

89
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,660
But if he is part of the test,
we must deal with this accordingly.

90
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,380
Papa! Mama! There is someone
who needs our help, please!

91
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,600
Let us save him!

92
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,140
Are you all right, lad?

93
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,440
This is all for merits... More merits!

94
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,490
Precisely.

95
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,760
You're heading to an interview. You wouldn't
dare sully your clothes with sewage.

96
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,030
Now, how will you elegantly get through—

97
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,860
Are you hurt?

98
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,510
Use my hanky, please.

99
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,370
Make sure you go to
the infirmary, just in case.

100
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,540
Clearly, I expected too much.

101
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,290
In the end, they were just some
commoners from the countryside.

102
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,050
Do not think for a second that you can

103
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,560
set foot in our house of
learning wearing soiled clothes.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,640
Throw K-212 out immediately.

105
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,850
Oh, no... These people are
going to fail because of me.

106
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,390
Um, I'm so sorr—

107
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,970
Thank goodness we anticipated this,

108
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,270
and prepared a change of
clothes just in case!

109
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,790
Who in the world would
ever anticipate that?!

110
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,820
Besides, your grey suit seems to
fit the attire at this school more.

111
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,580
If I had continued wearing my previous suit,

112
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,210
we would've been mistaken for
commoners from the countryside.

113
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,390
Thank you for giving us the
opportunity to change, lad.

114
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,480
On top of everything else,
they even thanked the boy!

115
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,380
Brilliant... So smart, and elegant!

116
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,380
Curse you and your cunning, Loid Forger.

117
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,110
Housemaster, we are supposed
to be testing the child.

118
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:56,940
Silence!

119
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,040
Children learn from their parents' example!

120
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,530
Yes. The parents of a child who scores 30
points must also be only worth 30 points!

121
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,640
I'll make you reveal your true identity yet!

122
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,080
Oh, no!

123
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,110
The animals have escaped the farmhouse!

124
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,410
You're really going this far, Eden College?!

125
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,200
Hey, don't push me!

126
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,470
Are they trying to see if we reveal
our true selves in an emergency?

127
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,180
We'll be playing right into the
examiners' hands if we panic.

128
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,330
Do not break Formation D.

129
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,020
We will show these animals
nothing but benevolence!

130
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,180
Hey.

131
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,670
Who told you to go that far?

132
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,180
Wait...

133
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,500
It wasn't you, Housemaster?

134
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,640
Impossible! Is this...

135
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,110
an actual accident?!

136
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,980
There are some very important
people among the examinees!

137
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,030
Go stop this mess before they're hurt!

138
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,370
I'm the Vice Minister of
the Ministry of Finance!

139
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,730
Hell if I care! I'm the
CEO of the Central Bank!

140
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,480
Are you all right?

141
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,990
Loid!

142
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,620
It's happening to Miss Anya again.

143
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,120
The mass panic must've hit her.

144
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,860
The test is the last thing
I need to worry about now.

145
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,130
That must be the leader of this herd.

146
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,020
That's the one I need to stop,
but I'll have to use my gun—

147
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,670
No...

148
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,650
Please look after Miss Anya for a moment.

149
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,670
Yor?

150
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,190
I-It's not what you think!

151
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,830
I once learned about pressure points that
can stop one's movements in a yoga class!

152
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,240
I-I figured they might work on cows, too!

153
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,270
Please don't look at me like that!

154
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,510
Ms. Cow?

155
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,210
Is she scared?

156
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,790
That's dangerous, Anya!

157
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,650
S'okay, please. Don't be scared.

158
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,380
What are you—

159
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,140
They're gonna go home now.

160
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,520
Apparently so.

161
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,160
Thankfully, no one was hurt.

162
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,290
E-Ele...

163
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,880
Ele-le... Ele-le-le-le...

164
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,680
<i>Elegance</i>!

165
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,430
Housemaster?

166
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,510
Forger!

167
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,770
He's...

168
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,760
one of the housemasters.

169
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,530
Is he in charge of this exam?

170
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,980
Y-You helped us avoid a crisis. I thank you.

171
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,640
And... you have bested me for today.

172
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,500
To give us all time to collect
ourselves after this chaos,

173
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,820
we will be delaying the
start of the interviews.

174
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,920
Return to your hall once you've
had a moment to tidy yourselves.

175
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,950
Your family has the right
to apply to our school.

176
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,060
Sir...

177
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,440
It looks like we've avoided failure.

178
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,540
I humbly thank you for your generosity.

179
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,650
But have no fear.

180
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,450
We anticipated something like this...

181
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,770
and prepared another change of clothes.

182
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:22,290
This isn't about elegance anymore!
These people are just scary!

183
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,620
The Forgers successfully make
it to the actual interview.

184
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,800
You truly thought you could apply to
our school without even knowing that?

185
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,650
Huh?

186
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,870
Well? Cat got your tongue?

187
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,770
Huh?

188
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,070
Um, uh...

189
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,730
Thank you very much.

190
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,160
What kind of answer was that?!

191
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,760
I've been a spy for over a decade,

192
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,090
and for the first time...

193
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,800
I'm actually nervous.

194
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,670
Even when I infiltrated the ranks
of an evil terrorist group,

195
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,840
or when I managed to stop the launch of
a missile with one second remaining...

196
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,730
I never found it so hard to
breathe as I do right now.

197
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,100
The fear of letting someone else
decide my success or failure...

198
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,090
Next, the Forgers.

199
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,270
Yes, sir.

200
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,210
Yes, this is definitely going to be...

201
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,590
the most crucial moment of Operation Strix!

202
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,500
Thank you for having us.

203
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,780
So you've come, Forgers.

204
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,900
The Forgers shall prevail in this
game of information warfare.

205
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:35,620
First, we will begin by asking
the parents a few questions.

206
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,970
The housemaster of Dorm 5, Malcom Hall.

207
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,570
Mild-mannered, sincere, and conservative.

208
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,520
The students are very fond of him.

209
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:47,300
As long as we respond with
sincere, logical answers,

210
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,160
we'll score highly with him.

211
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,850
I was informed that this is your second
wife. May I ask how you two met?

212
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,210
I see we're getting straight to the point.

213
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,610
Eden College does prioritize
family values, after all.

214
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,970
I met my wife at the tailor shop that
handles this school's uniforms,

215
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,370
and I was in awe of her grace.

216
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,400
Ever since I lost my first wife,

217
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,050
I was hesitant to pursue another
relationship because of my daughter.

218
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,850
But the more we spoke, the more
I felt that she was a kindred spirit.

219
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,790
She is truly kind and cares
dearly about family.

220
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,500
I came to the conclusion that she'd
get along well with my daughter.

221
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,350
Ah... And what about you, Madam?

222
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,970
Well...

223
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,870
L-Loid is a wonderful person who
truly cares for his daughter.

224
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,850
He's also very considerate of me.

225
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,690
Ah, I'm happy to hear that you
have such a loving family.

226
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:45,290
Why would a beautiful girl like you choose
to be with a man who's got baggage?

227
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,100
That was rather uncouth, Master Swan.

228
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,370
The housemaster of Dorm 2, Cline Hall.

229
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,450
He's the only son of the former
headmaster, and a legacy hire.

230
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,380
Arrogant, greedy, and callous.

231
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,300
His wife filed for divorce last month,

232
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,460
and he just lost custody
of his daughter, as well.

233
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,790
Reviewing all of his previous
interview questions and comments,

234
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,000
he is clearly jealous of other families,
and takes out his frustrations on them.

235
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,520
It's best that we avoid provoking him.

236
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,270
Now for our next question.

237
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,240
Could you tell us why you
chose to apply to our school?

238
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,070
For only one reason, sir.

239
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,280
To get close to my target, Desmond!

240
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,000
The quality of the instructors at
this establishment is superior.

241
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,370
Of course, you are all very
knowledgeable and cultured,

242
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:33,070
but when it comes to teaching anything,
from patriotism to how to be an elite,

243
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,340
the instructors of the
prestigious Eden College

244
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,500
are second to none.

245
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,900
Elegantly done, Loid Forger.

246
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,100
I knew I saw potential in you.

247
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,610
Now then, how would the two
of you describe your daughter?

248
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,050
Please let us know about her
strengths and weaknesses.

249
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,860
Anya is an extremely curious child.

250
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,990
Her habit of sticking her nose where it
doesn't belong could be seen as a weakness,

251
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,610
but she is a truly intelligent child.

252
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,700
Intelligent?! Her?!

253
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,120
Shock!

254
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,480
Sometimes, it's like she
sees right through me,

255
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,380
which keeps me on my feet.

256
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,240
I would say her main shortcoming
is that she's a picky eater.

257
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:18,700
Ah...  And how would you describe
your parenting style, Madam?

258
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,130
Just like we practiced...

259
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,220
As you already know, I am
not her biological mother.

260
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,790
At first, I spoiled her quite often
in hopes that she would like me.

261
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:35,440
But for the sake of her future, I'm hoping
I can become a bit stricter at times.

262
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,300
We've been told that your
daughter is a picky eater.

263
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,160
What kind of meals do you cook at home?

264
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,680
Huh? C-Cook?

265
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,450
Um...

266
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,890
I actually do most of the cooking.

267
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:51,840
Though when I'm busy, my wife
is kind enough to cook for me.

268
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,380
Not that that's happened even once yet.

269
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:57,190
You're joking! What kind of wife
can't cook for her husband?!

270
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:00,750
You should probably be stricter with
yourself before you worry about that child.

271
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,380
Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.

272
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,190
She is extremely tidy and excels
at keeping our house spotless.

273
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,600
She is also an excellent
mother to my daughter.

274
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Yes, well, both of those are
things women are expected to do.

275
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,460
That's—

276
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,090
I-It's all right, Loid.

277
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,850
Yes. Calm down.

278
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,460
Why are you getting irritated, Twilight?

279
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,450
She's not even your real wife.

280
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,730
A lovey-dovey hot couple? You make me sick.

281
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,400
I'll keep jabbing at you until you slip up.

282
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,450
If I can't make sure these two fail,
there's clearly no justice in this world.

283
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,000
N-Next, let's ask the
young lady some questions.

284
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,950
Here it comes.

285
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,550
First, could you tell us
your name and address?

286
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,720
My name is Anya Holger!

287
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,520
My address is in... Berlint, West District...

288
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,310
128 Park... Avenue!

289
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,530
And what do you do on your
days off, young lady?

290
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,130
We go to moozeums...

291
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,220
and eat operas...

292
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,100
Good. These were questions we anticipated.

293
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,460
What would you like to do once
you get into this school?

294
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,460
Um, uh...

295
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,530
What was I supposed to say?

296
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:16,140
In my case, I first need to
participate in a social gathering,

297
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,100
and get to the bottom of what the boss of
the enemy organization, Desmond, is planning.

298
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,600
I-I want to find out what the boss
of the organization is planning!

299
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,030
What in the world are you saying?! Hello?!

300
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:27,740
The boss of the organization?
Maybe you meant the headmaster.

301
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,070
I do apologize. My daughter
is rather ambitious.

302
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,890
She's extremely curious about the headmaster,
since he's clearly made it to the top.

303
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:36,760
Oho...

304
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,100
The desire to learn from her
predecessors at such an early age...

305
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,860
That's quite elegant.

306
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,680
Do you happen to know the name
of the principal, young lady?

307
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,080
Um, B-Be...

308
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,990
Yes. Benedict Ivan Goodfellow.

309
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,180
Mr. Benedick Advent Goodheller.

310
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,540
Hmm... Then,

311
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:01,140
could you tell us how hard you would have
to work in order to succeed like him?

312
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,980
Yes. Like getting through
the jungle with no supplies,

313
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:09,110
and dancing with death over
and over to get brave!

314
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,700
That was the training montage the
protagonist of her spy cartoon did yesterday.

315
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,330
S-Such incredible resolve!

316
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:18,320
It appears as though I have
underestimated this young lady.

317
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,220
I don't think you have to do quite that much.

318
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:25,670
Let's change the subject.
What does your father do for a living?

319
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,550
He's a sp—a speshulist in
mental health. A very good one.

320
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,100
Hm? Are you a little stuffed up?

321
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,010
Then how do you feel about your new mother?

322
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,800
She is very nice.

323
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,130
But she's scary sometimes.

324
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,230
If you were to give your parents
a score, what might that be?

325
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,260
A perfect 100 points.

326
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,020
My Papa and Mama are both so
much fun, and I love them very much.

327
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,390
I want to be with them forever.

328
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,660
Tch. God, no one needs this rubbish.

329
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,880
In that case, would you score your
old mother or your new mother higher?

330
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,450
Come now, Master Swan...

331
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,330
Is there a problem?

332
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,390
May I respectfully request
a different question?

333
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,110
Absolutely not. If you do not
answer, you will lose points.

334
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,230
I don't know exactly how she
ended up in that orphanage,

335
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,380
but her actual parents
are probably already...

336
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,060
Ma...ma...

337
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,050
Anya...

338
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,220
Mama...

339
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,050
I see, I see.

340
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,380
So you <i>do</i> prefer your old mother.

341
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,700
This is too cruel!

342
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,910
Please calm down, Yor.

343
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:35,620
But this is just—

344
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,470
We need to remain calm for
the sake of this mission.

345
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:41,400
We have plenty of students here who live
away from their parents in our dorms.

346
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,320
If she's going to cry over
every little trifling thing,

347
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,390
she'll never survive at our establishment!

348
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,060
So what if he's being slanderous?

349
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,700
We are nothing more than a pretend family.

350
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,540
This is nothing.

351
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,730
Now, now, Mrs. Second Wife.

352
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,650
Don't snap at me just because
she loves her real mother more.

353
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,440
Oh, I feel so much better.

354
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,410
Restrain yourself...

355
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,150
Twilight!

356
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,450
I do beg your pardon.

357
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,910
There was a mosquito.

358
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,600
Thank you very much for your time today.

359
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,710
Hey, where are you going?!

360
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,670
The interview's not over yet!

361
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,530
If making light of a child's feelings is part
of your establishment's educational policies,

362
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,730
then I'm afraid we have
chosen the wrong school.

363
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,710
You fiend! You dare
disgrace our fine school?!

364
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,700
Come now, you two.

365
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,620
Please excuse us.

366
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,270
Don't think you'll ever walk
through our gates again!

367
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,660
That's quite enough, Master Swan.

368
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,780
Are you taking issue with my methods?

369
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,400
He may be the former headmaster,

370
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,890
but my father's influence
within this school is still strong.

371
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,160
It'd be wise for you to
watch that mouth of yours.

372
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,670
Hey! Hurry up and call the next one in!

373
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,200
...the instructors of the
prestigious Eden College

374
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,220
are second to none.

375
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,920
If all I can do is curry
favor with the authorities,

376
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,300
I have no right to call myself an educator.

377
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,870
I must ask, who truly disgraced our school?

378
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,570
Huh?!

379
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,150
Wha—

380
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,350
Hmm...

381
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,100
That was rather elegant,
if I do say so myself.

382
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:27,710
Now, will you be able to face
the instructors at Eden head-on,

383
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,140
Forgers?

384
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,380
Yeah... We definitely failed.

385
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,590
I-I'll go make us some tea.

386
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,000
I've failed yet again as a spy.

387
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,370
I let unnecessary feelings get
in the way of the mission.

388
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,300
Papa...

389
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,260
I'm sorry.

390
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:52,310
I'm so sorry that I couldn't do better

391
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,960
on my tests.

392
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,070
It's all right, Anya. You have
no reason to apologize.

393
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,540
You don't want to go to
a school like that, do you?

394
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,930
But I want to go to school...

395
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:06,860
Huh?

396
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,270
If this mission fails...

397
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,470
I have to go to school or...

398
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,540
...we won't be together anymore.

399
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,370
Anya...

400
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,200
If she fails, of course,
our life here together will be...

401
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,130
But that doesn't matter.

402
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,630
I'm just worried how this may affect my work.

403
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,440
Hmm... But to be honest,

404
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,410
Hell will freeze over before you pass.

405
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,180
Shock!

406
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,400
I-I'm sure everything will be okay!

407
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,710
It'll all work out!

408
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,820
The grandpa with the glasses and
the grandpa with the half-glasses

409
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,010
were really nice!

410
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,330
Yes, exactly!

411
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,540
I'm sure they'll vouch for us!
Let's believe in them.

412
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,720
Spies don't believe in anyone
other than themselves.

413
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,820
They always expect the worst-case
scenarios and prepare for them.

414
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,340
I want to be with them forever.

415
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,420
But... Maybe just a little bit...

416
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:07,380
Yes. Let's leave the result to fate,

417
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,980
and try to recover from how
exhausting that exam was.

418
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,800
Right now, just for a little bit...

419
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,570
To our family's bright future!

420
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,240
Something just fell!

421
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,990
Our family portrait fell to the floor.

422
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,110
It just fell...

423
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,480
What will become

424
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,190
of their mission?
