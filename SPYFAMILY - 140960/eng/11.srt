1
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,490
Impossible... All of our pursuers are...

2
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,160
Let's go back to our hideout and regroup.

3
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,460
I have a bad feeling about this.

4
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,090
No way... Bondman, this can't be happening!

5
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,720
I can't believe this! Hey, hey! Wake up!

6
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,760
Hey, Anya.
I can't believe this! Hey, hey! Wake up!

7
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,640
Anya is busy right now.

8
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,350
This is just awful.

9
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,980
No! I don't wanna study!

10
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,400
Now, hold on.
No! I don't wanna study!

11
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:11,520
Now, hold on.

12
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,820
We made a deal. You agreed
to start studying at 5 PM.

13
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,280
You demon! Papa is a demon!

14
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,070
Operation Strix, Phase 2...
You demon! Papa is a demon!

15
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,460
You demon! Papa is a demon!

16
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,620
In order to attend the
target's social gathering,

17
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,500
I need to make sure my daughter
Anya becomes an Imperial Scholar.

18
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,500
For her to achieve that,
she will need to get good grades

19
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,260
and receive Stellas.

20
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,350
How many times do I have to tell you?

21
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,520
That's supposed to be an "E," not an "A."

22
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,360
B-But, Loid-san, her math
score here is pretty good.

23
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,980
Well done, Anya-san.

24
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,980
He has two-eighths of his bullets left!

25
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,160
Is this because of her cartoon?

26
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,490
Oh, that's right.

27
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,580
This proverb is the same one
Bondman was saying in episode 16.

28
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,500
I forgot...

29
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,750
Well, remember!

30
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,880
You know, it's the episode where the
guy with the sideburns appeared.

31
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,130
I just happened to mess up my
mind-reading cheat on this test.

32
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,590
From now on, I'm gonna spend a lot of time

33
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,260
trying to figure out which classmate
is good at what subject.

34
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,310
And then I will definitely
get perfect scores,

35
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,650
no problem.

36
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,980
I tried sounding like Papa.

37
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,150
It would be easy to make her every score
an A+ by using backdoor methods.

38
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,910
But if she suddenly scores that high,

39
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,580
the school and those around
her will become suspicious.

40
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,830
In order to make this all
seem as natural as possible,

41
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,910
I need to nurture her basic knowledge.

42
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:58,750
If she ends up being shunned by her
classmates, it may affect her life at school.

43
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,000
I can't have her not wanting to go to school.

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,130
If I read everyone's minds to
get 100s, they'll all hate me?

45
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,680
Hey, how do you even know that?

46
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,680
You creepy little witch!

47
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,310
I guess forcing her to study too
much might be a bit rough on her.

48
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,280
If her motivation remains low,
her concentration won't improve,

49
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,030
so she'll have a lesser chance of learning.

50
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,910
A change of pace is also important.

51
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,700
There are ways of earning
Stella besides academics.

52
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,700
Right, then.

53
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,660
Why don't we take a break
from studying and draw?

54
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,220
For example, art.

55
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,700
Hey, that looks really cool!

56
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,630
Is it a cheetah? No, wait...

57
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,510
I bet it's a panda!

58
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,720
It's a moo cow. The one that was at school.

59
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,340
For example, music!

60
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,480
This is a violin for children.

61
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,990
There's always sports!

62
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,990
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

63
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,460
Come on, don't cry.

64
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,790
Stay calm, Twilight.

65
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,420
A journey of a thousand miles
begins with a single step.

66
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,340
She's still in first grade.

67
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,930
I need to figure out what she has a
talent for and help her excel in it.

68
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,060
Why don't we do some jump rope?

69
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,640
It's a lot of fun.

70
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,020
Right. Don't panic.

71
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,060
It's not like Desmond is immediately
going to make his move.

72
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,440
It takes an incredible amount
of time to begin a war.

73
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,940
But...

74
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,450
HQ was estimating that she'd be able to
receive eight Stella in about four months.

75
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,120
Do we actually have that much time?

76
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,290
Papa...

77
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,460
Anya will do her best.

78
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,880
Now untie me.

79
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,470
Uh, right.

80
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,180
Anya.

81
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,970
Why don't we go out tomorrow?

82
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,310
An ooting?

83
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,560
Academics, the arts, sports...

84
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,860
But there is actually one
other way to earn Stella.

85
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,730
Community service.

86
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:31,370
Thank you so much for agreeing to
volunteer at our hospital today.

87
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,370
I will now go over the duties
we'll be asking you to perform.

88
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,710
We will have you split up into
your families to perform your duties.

89
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,420
In the past, there have been
many cases where students

90
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,250
did long-term volunteer work
to earn their Stella.

91
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,090
Rescuing others or helping
apprehend criminals

92
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,260
were also methods a few used
to earn Stella, but rare.

93
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,390
We could use more personnel from
HQ to act out these scenarios,

94
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,980
but considering the risks that could entail,
we won't be able to easily pull that off.

95
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,770
Even if she isn't immediately
able to receive any Stella,

96
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,780
it would be beneficial to Anya to learn
the importance of community service.

97
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:14,790
Now, if I can have the Forgers
clean this dressing room.

98
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,790
There's a pool!

99
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes, for physical therapy.

100
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,170
Maybe cleaning was a bit difficult for you.

101
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,800
Then let's have you organize
books in the library.

102
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,180
Excuse me, sir, could you
do something about... that?

103
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,560
Could you go work somewhere else?

104
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,090
Anya is bored with chores.

105
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,740
I wanna do the job where I give
the doctors their scalpels.

106
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,450
Huh?

107
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,330
I'mma go to the operating room!

108
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,540
Hey! Stop that! Come back here!

109
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,340
We've had enough of your "help"! Please leave!

110
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,270
Papa, I'm sorry.

111
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,890
Don't worry about it.
Everyone fails sometimes.

112
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:27,940
But what do we do if our chances of earning
Stella through community service also dry up?

113
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,530
Hey, is physical therapy hard?

114
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,990
It is,

115
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,030
but you need to work hard
so that you can run again.

116
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,660
Man...

117
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,790
Three more minutes.

118
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,420
Hey, is the water in the pool cold?

119
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,960
Don't worry about that. Go on, get changed.

120
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,800
I'll go get changed, too.

121
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,300
I wonder if that's the adult pool...

122
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,440
Man... it really is kinda cold.

123
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,320
Ken?

124
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,450
Huh? Is he still changing?

125
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:26,960
Hmm... I might have to ask HQ
to reconsider our game plan.

126
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,380
C-Can't... breathe...

127
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,710
My legs... won't move...

128
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,510
The pool!

129
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,380
Papa!

130
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,720
What is it? You just went to
the bathroom, didn't you?

131
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,140
Someone's drowning in the pool!

132
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,430
What?! How do you know that?

133
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,310
Exactly who are you?!

134
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,860
Help me... Help me...

135
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,980
Papa...

136
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,860
Anya is terrible at volunteering.

137
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,900
So I...

138
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,410
I'm gonna become a pro swimmer and get stars,

139
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,950
so I'm gonna go practice in the pool!

140
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,370
What?! Come back here!
That's not a public pool!

141
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,370
Ken!

142
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,010
He must've snuck out.

143
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,800
Hey!

144
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,640
Where are your parents?

145
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,560
Wow! The pool! How fun!

146
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,600
What's that about?

147
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,690
Where is the drowning person?

148
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,400
I'm...

149
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,490
I'm... gonna die...

150
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,570
What are you doing, little girl?!

151
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,430
Anya... can't... anymore...

152
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,400
Hey, are you two all right?

153
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,700
Ken!

154
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,820
Papa...

155
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,700
Someone get a doctor!

156
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,410
I tried to swim and found this boy sinking.

157
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,460
Ken!

158
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,830
Are you all right?

159
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,210
Ken!

160
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,380
Calm down, miss.

161
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,590
Is everything okay?

162
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,630
Ken! Ken!

163
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,010
But there were so many people around.

164
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:46,890
Did you hear anything?

165
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,310
I'm so sorry! I had no
idea you were drowning!

166
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,100
It was a drowning response.

167
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,980
Children tend to drown more
quietly than you would expect.

168
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,570
Many die because no one
notices they're drowning.

169
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,690
Please make sure you keep your eye on him.

170
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,410
And good job for noticing.

171
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,530
I saw bubbles.

172
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,200
And you should be careful, too.

173
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,290
Thank you! Thank you!

174
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,500
Well done, little girl!

175
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,350
First-year student from the
Cecile Dorm, Anya Forger,

176
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,730
has earned a Stella for rescuing a boy.

177
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,900
You're amazing, Anya!

178
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,990
You're the first of the
first graders to get one!

179
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,410
I'm so proud of you for some reason.

180
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,990
Ultra-amazingly elegant, Miss Forger.
I'm so proud of you for some reason.

181
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,330
Well done, Anya!
Ultra-amazingly elegant, Miss Forger.

182
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:50,910
Well done, Anya!

183
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,910
She beat me.

184
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,930
You're amazing, Miss Anya! Truly amazing!

185
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,770
I'm so happy for you!

186
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,810
She unexpectedly earned a Stella.

187
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,440
An excellent result,

188
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,770
but how do I describe this?

189
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,530
It's similar to how I feel when
I've thwarted a terrorist attack.

190
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,530
I'm so proud of her.

191
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,700
Well done.

192
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,040
Anya's powers actually helped someone?

193
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,750
Eheh!

194
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,420
All right, then. I'm going
to make you a feast today.

195
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,050
Anya wants Papa to cook.

196
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,180
Shock!

197
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:04,360
I heard that your daughter earned
a Stella, Agent Twilight.

198
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,240
Yes, Handler. She somehow managed it.

199
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,620
Couldn't we set things up with other agents

200
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,830
to fake whatever you need
to get the other Stella?

201
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,580
People would get suspicious.

202
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,630
More importantly, we can't
take risks that could potentially

203
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,920
expose the identities of other
agents or get them arrested.

204
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,590
Yes, you've got a point.

205
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,600
Is HQ panicking a bit?

206
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,100
No.

207
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,360
But there are numerous
businesses surrounding Desmond

208
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,940
that seem to be engaging in shady
financial dealings lately.

209
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,940
We can't be too laid back in this situation.

210
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,110
Try to make contact with Desmond immediately.

211
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:50,070
Give your daughter some candy or
something to get her motivated.

212
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,370
Morning!

213
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,030
Did you see that thing yesterday?

214
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,830
I forgot my homework!

215
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,260
Heh.

216
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,350
Hey, is that her? The girl from
Class 3 that suddenly got a Stella?

217
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,970
Apparently it's a new record.

218
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,600
I heard she rescued someone.

219
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:18,850
This star is just so brilliant
that I stand out now.

220
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:19,890
Really?
This star is just so brilliant
that I stand out now.

221
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,560
This star is just so brilliant
that I stand out now.

222
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,320
Heh.

223
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,410
Good morning, Anya!

224
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,620
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

225
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,210
Call me "Starlight Anya."

226
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,080
Uh... Sure.

227
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,050
You're totally like a celebrity now.

228
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,760
Everyone looks up to you.

229
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,930
You might even make a hundred friends!

230
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:55,600
Bam!

231
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,100
I totally see you in a new light,
Miss Anya! Be my friend!

232
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,600
You should totally come over
to my place with your dad!

233
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,600
Bam!

234
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,110
Well done, Anya! The mission is now a success!

235
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,820
And so the world was at peace.

236
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,160
Don't get a big head.

237
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,740
What's their problem?
Ugh! They make me so mad!

238
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,860
That didn't go as planned.
The world is in peril.

239
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,250
Let's go, Anya.

240
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,220
Let's go, Starlight Anya.

241
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,090
Yup.

242
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,720
Ugh, what a pain.

243
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,140
Ha. That's hilarious.

244
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,770
Who does she think she is?

245
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,900
She keeps showing off her stupid badge.

246
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,320
Who actually comes to school wearing it?

247
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:58,120
Who would believe such a violent
girl actually rescued someone?

248
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,540
They say she saved a kid from drowning,

249
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,500
but she probably kicked him
in and let him sink herself.

250
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,250
Oh, I could totally see that!

251
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,960
What if she actually paid the school
a bunch of money for her Stella?

252
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,670
What? She doesn't look that rich to me.

253
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,220
Shock...

254
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,680
Don't even worry about it.
They're all just jealous.

255
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,310
Hey, Damian. Wouldn't you agree?

256
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,310
She totally cheated, didn't she?

257
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,310
Do you really think we go
to some third-rate school

258
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,280
that would hand out Stella by mistake?
Or because someone was being underhanded?

259
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,490
<i>Is</i> that what you think?

260
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,320
Uh, no...

261
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,320
If you've got a problem with our school,

262
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,370
why don't you take the
transfer exam for another one?

263
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:44,080
He's so manly at times like this.

264
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,830
Gosh, he's cool.

265
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,380
The fact that she didn't cheat is why I'm so
mad that this little shrimp got ahead of me.

266
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,190
Maybe he's more earnest than he looks.

267
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,180
Let's begin class.

268
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,610
By the way,

269
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,280
have you decided what your
reward's going to be,

270
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,150
Anâ€”Starlight Anya?

271
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,110
Reward?

272
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,700
Of course! Whenever you work
really hard on tests or contests,

273
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,490
you're supposed to get a reward.

274
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,080
You mean I can get peanuts?

275
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,620
Come on, you should ask for
something way more expensive.

276
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,040
After the test we had the other day,

277
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,000
I got them to buy me a cute
little dress and a tiara!

278
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,630
But I mean...

279
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,840
I guess they haven't given me <i>that</i> much.

280
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,770
Is your family part of a secret
organization that pulls the world's strings?

281
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,640
What are you talking about?
They run a perfectly legitimate company.

282
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,070
Then Anya wants a castle.

283
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,820
That might be asking for too much.

284
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,280
Where would you even put it?

285
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,660
Then...

286
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,990
A year's worth of peanuts?

287
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,080
That shouldn't be a problem at all,
but is that really what you want?

288
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,120
Rewards are difficult.

289
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:16,420
Well... I think the reward that made
me the happiest is my little Wiesel.

290
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,180
Oh, that's my puppy! It's the cutest!

291
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,220
Come here, Weezy!

292
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,100
Mister Dog?

293
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,230
Do you have a dog, too, Second Son?

294
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,860
Huh? A dog?

295
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,190
What are you asking that jerk for?

296
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,780
Max!

297
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,710
Who cares?

298
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,790
Don't talk to me!

299
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,170
Anya has a doggy now, too.

300
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,590
All right! Let's see who's cuter, yours or my Max!

301
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,460
Bring it over to my place! And your dad, too!

302
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,430
Well, hello, Mr. Forger.

303
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,430
Let's stop this war, Mr. Desmond.

304
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,140
And so the world was at peace.

305
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,390
Heh.

306
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,400
You want a dog... as a reward?

307
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,070
Mm-hm.

308
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,820
Having a dog will bring peace.

309
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,860
Peace? Like peace of mind?

310
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,570
Hmm... Well, I <i>was</i> thinking
of buying you something.

311
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,450
Miss Anya...

312
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:32,540
Taking care of a living creature
requires a lot of work.

313
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,830
It is a very big responsibility!

314
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,170
Responsibility...

315
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,470
A dog, huh? Yeah...

316
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,090
Let's discuss this a bit further.

317
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,300
Loid...

318
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,390
Papa!

319
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,980
A properly trained dog may prove
useful in securing this house.

320
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,310
Dogs are so violent, though.

321
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,940
I'm so terribly worried that one
might rip Miss Anya to shreds.

322
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:03,280
Anya would like a cute puppy, please, Papa.

323
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,490
A tiny one.

324
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,700
Huh? Sure, all right.

325
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:14,040
Ah, well. I'm sure we can find
a small dog that's still capable.

326
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,540
I'll see if HQ can get us one later.

327
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:21,050
All right. Why don't we go
to a pet shop this weekend?

328
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,260
We get a buyer yet?

329
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,060
Things are pretty tough right now.

330
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,600
We got some punks who think
they're revolutionaries.

331
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,490
What, they gonna use 'em as bomb dogs?

332
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,820
These little guys sure have it rough,

333
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,990
getting tinkered with just so they can
end up as toys for some humans.

334
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,230
Shut up! If you want food, quit yer yappin'!

335
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,770
They sure don't look that smart.

336
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,010
Do Numbers Three and Five look weaker to you?

337
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,490
Hell if I know. Who cares?

338
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,520
God, it always reeks in here.

339
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,240
Yeah, let's get the hell outta here.

340
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,020
Anya wants this one...

341
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,240
Or this one!

342
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,790
Oh, thank goodness. They look very weak.
