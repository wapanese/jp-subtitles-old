1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,480
How much longer to the embassy?

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,070
I believe it'll be around 20 minutes, sir.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:10,470
Huh?

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,970
The brake's not working.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,160
Hey, you! Up front! Look up front!

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,080
One of our diplomats perished
in a car accident in Ostania.

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:29,420
But we believe it to be an assassination
by the East's far-right political party.

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,380
They are plotting a war against
our nation of Westalis.

9
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,100
We must do everything we can
to figure out their plan.

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,380
Let's let <i>him</i> take care of it.

11
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,380
The best agent we have.

12
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,650
"Twilight."

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,890
Here's the goods I promised.

14
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,000
Proof that the foreign
minister wears a toupee.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,100
I even have the negatives.

16
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,880
Well done.

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,450
Now we can force him to resign.

18
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,400
I look forward to doing
business with you again.

19
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,690
Hey.

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,030
How about you hand over the goods now?

21
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,510
Huh? Wha—But you just—

22
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,300
He got me!

23
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,660
Code name: Twilight.

24
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,300
A spy.

25
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,310
In an era in which the nations of
the world were waging a fierce war

26
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,110
of information just out of sight,

27
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,580
this man survived that battlefield by being

28
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,880
a master of disguise,
a man with a hundred faces.

29
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,970
So Daddy's been in such a bad
mood lately because someone

30
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,940
stole his toupee pictures, or something.

31
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,060
What even? Ugh, I'm so mad.

32
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,230
Hello? Are you even listening, Robert?

33
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,580
Hm? Yes, that's rather unfortunate.

34
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,520
So, Robert... Do you think
one day we'll also—

35
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,260
Karen, let's break up.

36
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:51,930
What?!

37
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,720
I'm afraid I can't sense any intelligence
in your conversations.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,840
Farewell. May you find happiness.

39
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,140
Hey, Robert! Wait!
You can't just do that to me!

40
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,610
Robert!

41
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,590
Sorry, Karen, but I have no
further use for your family.

42
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,610
As of tonight, I'm also done with
the mask known as Robert.

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,850
Marriage? Conventional happiness?

44
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:16,710
I got rid of those aspirations, as well
as my identity, the day I became a spy.

45
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,170
Meow.

46
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,660
Must be Cipher C.

47
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,510
The train bound for Berlint is
now departing from track 5.

48
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,510
Good day, or perhaps,
good evening, Twilight.

49
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,910
Well done on your last mission.

50
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,520
Thanks to you, the minister lived another day,
to the great benefit of our country.

51
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,670
Now, then, I have your next mission.

52
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,740
Your target is the leader of the
National Unity Party, Donovan Desmond.

53
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,020
He is a great threat to the truce
between the East and the West.

54
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,440
Your mission is to get close to him
and probe any seditious activities.

55
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,650
In order to achieve this,

56
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,640
you will get married and have a child.

57
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:07,860
Sorry, what?!

58
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,630
Desmond is an extremely cautious
man who rarely appears in public.

59
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,640
He only appears at social gatherings held
at the elite private school his son attends.

60
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,680
These events are informal get-togethers for the
upper echelon of industrial and political leaders.

61
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,190
You will have your child
enroll in this school

62
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,010
and infiltrate one of the social gatherings.

63
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,270
The enrollment deadline is drawing near,
meaning you have one week to pull this off.

64
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,570
You expect me to produce a
child within seven days?!

65
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,370
Please excuse me.

66
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,120
Operation Strix.

67
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,900
This operation is the key to maintaining
peace between East and West...

68
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,530
and perhaps, the world.

69
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,920
Hero who casts no shadow,

70
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,070
the great deeds you and your fellow
agents do shall never see the light of day.

71
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,530
You will never earn any medals
nor make it into the papers.

72
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,580
Even so...

73
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,320
Never forget that everyone else's
day-to-day lives are possible

74
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,850
because of your blood, sweat, and tears.

75
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,460
Very well.

76
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,320
I abandoned my identity
when I became Twilight.

77
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,130
I will play the part of a
father with a child if I must,

78
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,130
for the sake of a better world.

79
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,820
This is one of our single-family apartments.

80
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,410
The unit comes furnished, includes central
air conditioning and heating, and...

81
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,860
Um... Sir?

82
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,520
No wiretaps detected, and there
are securable escape routes.

83
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,790
I'll take it.

84
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,490
Excellent, Mr. Forger. Now,
if you'd sign these documents...

85
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,290
Loid Forger. Occupation: psychiatrist.

86
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,590
That's my new life.

87
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,830
With a family I love and
a happy home life...

88
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,330
How nice that you and your family
are moving into a new home.

89
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,720
Do you have a boy or a girl?

90
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,340
Ah, well...

91
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,600
I'll be deciding on that soon.

92
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,130
Huh?

93
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,290
What an absolute burden for a spy.

94
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,510
Huh? You wanna adopt?

95
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,490
Indeed. I heard that your orphanage
was looking for candidates.

96
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,300
You see, my wife and I—

97
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,100
Yeah, sure. Take whichever one you want.
You see, my wife and I—

98
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,760
Yeah, sure. Take whichever one you want.

99
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,370
Come on in.

100
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,720
What a terrible environment.

101
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,110
But the shadier the establishment,

102
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,200
the more likely these children
have complicated pasts,

103
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,330
so it'll be easier to alter their stories.

104
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,120
I can make this mission
work if I have a child.

105
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,360
I would've preferred to
handle it all on my own,

106
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,150
but I can't exactly disguise myself as a child,

107
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,380
no matter how skilled a spy I am.

108
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,400
Pardon me. If possible, I'd like
a child who can read and write.

109
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,890
Well, in that case...

110
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,540
Hey, Anya.

111
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,260
She's the smartest one we've got.

112
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,390
She don't talk much, but she's a good kid.

113
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,810
She's a creepy, disgusting little brat.

114
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,260
I'd be thrilled to get her outta my hair.

115
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,120
Go on. Say hello.

116
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,290
Er... Pardon me.

117
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,270
If I recall, the earliest age students
can enter Eden College is six.

118
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,080
She definitely looks no
older than four or five.

119
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,800
Six.

120
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,510
I'm six!

121
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,800
You're six years old?

122
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,170
But she's so small...

123
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,790
Hm? The paper?

124
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,680
A crossword puzzle?

125
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,000
That's probably too difficult for a child.

126
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,780
Of course, for myself,
it's mere child's play.

127
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,700
One down is "homeostasis."

128
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,730
One across is "causal closure."

129
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,170
The one below that is "symplectomorphism."

130
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,530
She completed it? Seriously?

131
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,380
Such unbelievable intellect.

132
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,210
She should have no problem
passing the entrance exam.

133
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,530
I'll take her.

134
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,290
As for the paperwork...

135
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,280
Don't worry about that.
Just take her already.

136
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,930
My mission to end up with
a child is a success.

137
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,140
Everything's going so well
that it's making me nervous.

138
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,630
Are you okay with this?

139
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,240
A spy... mission...

140
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,480
So exciting!

141
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,710
This little girl happened to be a telepath.

142
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,050
Test Subject 007.

143
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,120
She possessed the ability
to read people's minds.

144
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,530
She was unintentionally created in an
experiment by a certain organization,

145
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,500
and she later fled their facility.

146
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,170
She has been wandering around looking
for someone to take care of her.

147
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,720
Now, listen, little girl.

148
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,520
Anya.

149
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,970
Now, listen, Anya.

150
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,030
Starting today, you will be my daughter,

151
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,180
but if anyone asks,
you've always been my daughter.

152
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:12,950
Got it?

153
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,660
Yep.

154
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,160
Make sure you address me as "Father."

155
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,240
Papa!

156
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,910
Very well.

157
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,760
Well, aren't you a cute
little girl? Hello there.

158
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,550
We're the Forgers. We just moved in today.

159
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,180
I am Anya. I have been Papa's
child for a very long time.

160
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,620
That wasn't necessary.

161
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,680
Come on, let's go inside.

162
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,860
This is Anya's house?

163
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,730
Yes.

164
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,940
A TV!

165
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,030
Go ahead and turn it on.

166
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,680
I like this show.

167
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,700
Of all things...

168
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,080
A gun with a silencer?

169
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,060
So exciting.

170
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,100
First, I'll have to gather
everything we'll need.

171
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,580
And I'll have to forge an ID for her.

172
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,160
I'm going out for a bit.

173
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,720
Just sit there and watch your show.

174
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,760
An adventure!

175
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,820
I'm not going on an adventure.
I'm just going shopping.

176
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,810
I want a pistol with a silencer!

177
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,340
Sure. Maybe if we can find one on sale.

178
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,160
To be a master spy,

179
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,970
one must act normal and never
draw attention to themselves.

180
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,860
We must do everything we can
to look like an ordinary family.

181
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,360
Must you draw attention to yourself?

182
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,700
Now, now. You need to make sure
you hold the little one's hand.

183
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,610
Here.

184
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,530
Having one hand tied up will make it difficult
to prepare for an enemy ambush,

185
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,420
but no matter.

186
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,440
An enemy?!

187
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,100
What are you doing?

188
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,010
Hiding!

189
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,240
Did I do anything to make
her want to hide from me?

190
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,920
Perhaps I held her hand too
early. Does she hate me?

191
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,860
This isn't good.

192
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,380
I need to maintain a good relationship
with her until the end of this mission.

193
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,390
I must know more about this creature.

194
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,380
It's basic diplomacy. Understanding the other
party is the first step toward peace.

195
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,260
Understanding me will lead to world peace?!

196
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,270
I like peanuts.

197
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,380
And I don't like carrots.

198
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,440
Uh-huh...

199
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,310
But I really like crispy
bacon from bakenries!

200
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,500
That's a "bakery." They do not sell bacon.

201
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,120
I'd like this, please.

202
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,690
That costs one dalc. You can't
buy it with a ten-pent coin.

203
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,190
Is this girl actually stupid?

204
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,960
Was the crossword puzzle a fluke?

205
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,880
Maybe I can still go back
and get another child—

206
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,670
Pwease don't get rid of me!

207
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,060
What's gotten into you?!
Pwease don't get rid of me!

208
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:38,580
Pwease! I'm a good bargain!

209
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,920
What do I do?

210
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,240
I'll buy you some peanuts! Just stop crying!

211
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,050
Peanuts!

212
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,190
Papa, I'm tired.

213
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,640
Can't walk anymore...

214
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,580
What?

215
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,190
This isn't working...
I just don't understand

216
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,900
this irrational behavior.

217
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,990
I need some manuals to
help me understand it.

218
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,000
"The key to raising a child is trust."

219
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,500
"Rather than scolding them, try to
understand things from their perspective."

220
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,020
"Children are not very good at putting
how they're feeling into words,

221
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,740
so try to understand them more."
So no interrogating them, then?

222
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,840
Do the parents of the world

223
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,510
normally carry out such difficult
missions all the time?

224
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,180
"Nurture their self-esteem
to give them a better future."

225
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,170
"By giving them the ability to think
for themselves, their future..."

226
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,800
As soon as I'm done with this mission,
I'm sending her back to the orphanage.

227
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,430
That's the extent of our relationship.

228
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,640
Don't wanna!

229
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,090
I don't wanna study!

230
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,620
I need to know how smart
you are for this exam.

231
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,730
I don't need to study to do any tests.

232
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,120
If I just read other people's...

233
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,130
...people's minds...

234
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,230
Are you planning on cheating? Listen.

235
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,810
If you don't get into this school...

236
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:02,850
...my mission fails.

237
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,650
Fine, then.

238
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,310
I'm heading out.

239
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,540
You're not coming with me today.

240
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,090
No matter what.

241
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,270
You're staying home.

242
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:22,690
Hey!

243
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,670
I told you, you're not coming!

244
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,660
You there! Do you really
think I don't see you?

245
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,070
There!

246
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,290
There!

247
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,820
Papa is so good at finding me.

248
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,750
It's so much fun!

249
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,750
Try and get out of that!

250
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,770
So that's why you're late?

251
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,760
In the end, I put up a barricade in front
of the door and trapped her inside.

252
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,560
I'm praying that you don't get
reported for child abuse.

253
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,090
Who knows what children are thinking?

254
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,520
Their method of always crying to
get their way is truly annoying.

255
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,720
Hate to tell you this, Twilight,
but crying is their job.

256
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,160
More importantly, here's what you asked for.

257
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,850
An application, ticket for the exam,
and exam questions.

258
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,140
I went through hell getting these for you.

259
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,620
Thanks, Franky.

260
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,370
I think we can make things work if
we have her memorize everything.

261
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,270
Oh, yeah. About your daughter...

262
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,610
I dug up some records on her past
that the orphanage didn't have.

263
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,340
I couldn't find anything about her birth.

264
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,380
No info on her age or parents, either.

265
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,730
I could only find information
from the last year,

266
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,610
but she's been adopted four
times and returned each time.

267
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,670
She's also been to two other orphanages.

268
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,340
"Anya Williams, Anya Levski, Anya Roche"...

269
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,130
She changes names as much as you do.

270
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,840
You guys are perfect for each other.

271
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,390
Hey, I'm kidding. This is
for your mission, right?

272
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,970
She may be a kid, but no good's gonna
come out of getting too attached.

273
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,560
Thanks for the concern.

274
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,200
Hello? Where's my money?!

275
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:47,000
Damn it... Who knows what
spies are thinking, either?

276
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,970
I'm so bored. Spies aren't
like what I thought.

277
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,830
I just want to get the bomb back.

278
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,460
I can't have her messing with my
spy equipment, so I'll lock it up.

279
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,100
The code is 6, 1...

280
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,020
...1, 0.

281
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,930
Bomby-bombs! Bomby-bombs!

282
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,470
Bomby-bombs! Bomby-bombs!

283
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,180
Ooh!

284
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,970
Secret messages!

285
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,980
Secrets, secrets...

286
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,500
Boss! We've intercepted a new message.

287
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,140
Is it using the West's cipher?

288
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,420
No, it's just plain text.

289
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,200
It says... "Twilight here"...

290
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,490
Twilight here!

291
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,920
This is the frequency used
by Western intelligence.

292
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,380
Oh, there's more. "Catch me if you can"...

293
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,580
Hurry up and pinpoint
where it's coming from!

294
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,760
Whew...

295
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,370
Now that you've found out I'm
a spy, you'll have to disappear.

296
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,950
If he finds out I'm a telepath...

297
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,060
I'll have to leave.

298
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,580
Anya, you mustn't tell
anyone about your power.

299
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,430
It's time to study now, Anya.

300
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,270
But I wanna draw...

301
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,980
Don't bother with childish games.

302
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,280
We must use your power for
the sake of world peace.

303
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,460
There's no time for tears, either.

304
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,300
Now, enough playing. Back to studying.

305
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,020
She'd better not have messed
up the apartment.

306
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,880
Oh, right. I need to move this.

307
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,100
Who the hell are these guys?!

308
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,700
Anya!

309
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,790
Anya!

310
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,160
She's been kidnapped?

311
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,000
By whoever sent these thugs? But why?

312
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,860
I need to find her immediately. Calm down.

313
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,820
From the looks of it,
I've been compromised.

314
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,550
I need to get to safety immediately.

315
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,320
As for Anya...

316
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,220
There are plenty of other
children out there.

317
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,080
I'll start things over
from square one and—

318
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,940
So who the hell is this kid?

319
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,650
Could she be Twilight's?

320
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,740
No idea. She was in the room
where the message came from,

321
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,940
so we snatched her just in case.

322
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,170
Because of the transmission?

323
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:37,440
She was holed up inside the apartment
with a barricade out front.

324
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,560
Why out front?

325
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,460
Beats me.

326
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,760
Well, no matter. We might be
able to use her as a hostage

327
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,890
in order to force Twilight
to steal the toupee

328
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,880
off of the foreign minister's
head personally.

329
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,440
Boss, I think we should just
give up on the toupee.

330
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,320
Transparency is essential in government.

331
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,690
Toupees are a no-go.

332
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,750
A pistol with a silencer...

333
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,790
Also, the minister's a traitor who's
been secretly backing the West.

334
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,700
Anyone who advocates for
a traitor is also a traitor.

335
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,600
A real bad guy...

336
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,590
Boss! Nguyen and his guys
are back from the apartment!

337
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,440
We captured him.

338
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,710
Well done.

339
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,190
Those weren't the moves of an
amateur. He's the real deal.

340
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,950
Go rest over there.

341
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,760
Now then, Twilight...

342
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,160
Let's have you return the
photographs you stole from me.

343
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,310
Nguyen!

344
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,750
What's going on?! He was just—

345
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,760
The kid's gone!

346
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,730
He got me again!

347
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,150
This was a mistake.

348
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,880
I risked everything by waltzing
right into enemy territory.

349
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,020
I'm a failure as a spy.

350
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,920
Papa...

351
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,710
Pabwaaaaaah!

352
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,610
Look, you're okay. I won't do anything.
Pabwaaaaaah!

353
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,530
Look, you're okay. I won't do anything.

354
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,220
You don't have to be scared.

355
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:47,680
Pabwaaaaaah!
You don't have to be scared.

356
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,270
Pabwaaaaaah!

357
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,880
This is exactly why kids suck.
Pabwaaaaaah!

358
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,860
I see.

359
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,980
I think I figured out why I hate
the sound of kids crying so much.

360
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,120
Because I end up remembering
my own childhood.

361
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,780
No one reached out their hand to save me.

362
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,440
I felt alone, in despair, and so
powerless that all I could do was cry.

363
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,960
I thought I'd abandoned that past,
but on a subconscious level,

364
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,600
she was reminding me of me.

365
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,830
No, actually...

366
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,730
Listen up, little girl.

367
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,760
Anya.

368
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,460
Listen up, Anya.

369
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:26,090
Me and my friends are pro tag players.

370
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:30,440
Whenever we spot someone with potential,
we immediately challenge them to a game.

371
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,250
Oh.

372
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,680
Papa is a liar.

373
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,280
Now, listen.

374
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,910
If you go straight down
this street and turn right,

375
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,040
you'll find a police station.

376
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,650
If you can get this to a
police officer, you win the game.

377
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,460
Got it?

378
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,930
If you show them this, they'll put
you in a better orphanage.

379
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,040
I'm not going to involve
a kid in this mission.

380
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,930
I'll figure something
out and rework the plan.

381
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:49,940
Pa—
I'll figure something
out and rework the plan.

382
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,660
All right, go! Hurry!

383
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,420
I'm a failure as a spy? No.

384
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,750
My mistake was putting that little
girl in danger to begin with.

385
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,260
How could I forget?

386
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,510
To create a world where
children won't have to cry...

387
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,730
That's why I became a spy.

388
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,700
Don't let that bastard get away!

389
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,790
We're gonna drag him out here
and expose his face to—

390
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,000
A trap? When did he—

391
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,920
What is this? Flour?

392
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,080
T-Twilight?!

393
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,290
Don't shoot! This whole place will blow!

394
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:33,390
Wha—

395
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,870
You've gotta be shitting me.

396
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,780
Turn around, and I'll kill you.

397
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,390
Twilight...

398
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,920
Good day, or perhaps, good evening, Edgar.

399
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,250
How's Karen doing?

400
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,390
How do you know my daughter's name?

401
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,610
Of course I know. That's what spies do.

402
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,630
I know her height, weight, shoe size,

403
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,400
her favorite foods, even how
many moles are on her body.

404
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,980
Though it's nothing compared to your record,
I know of her criminal activity, too.

405
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,660
Absurd! My daughter would never—

406
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,230
Edgar.

407
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,420
I also know how much you
care about your daughter.

408
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,240
So listen carefully.

409
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,480
If you wish for her to have any
semblance of a normal life,

410
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,310
you'll leave me the hell alone.

411
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,460
If you understand, go home right now.

412
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,420
Anya!

413
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,350
Papa!

414
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,420
Papa!

415
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,280
What are you—I mean,

416
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,530
what are you doing outside the house?

417
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,730
I, uh, just happened to come here to shop,

418
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,210
but I guess they went out of business.

419
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,300
Papa is a huge liar.

420
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,050
I was playing tag with some old guys.

421
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,190
Oh, I see. Did you have fun?

422
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,950
It was a little scary.

423
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,790
I wanna go home.

424
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,480
To our home, Papa.

425
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,880
Are you sure?

426
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,960
If you leave me behind, I'm going to cry.

427
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,850
She's been adopted four times
and returned each time.

428
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,790
Anya Williams... Anya Levski...

429
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,240
Anya Roche.

430
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,730
I see.

431
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,920
Well, let's go home, then.

432
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,010
But that apartment is far
too dangerous, so let's move.

433
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,820
I spotted a poisonous snake there yesterday.

434
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,740
I don't like snakes.

435
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,580
Papa is a huge liar...

436
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,990
But he's such a cool liar.

437
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,760
I wanna live in a castle.

438
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,000
We'll see if one's listed.

439
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,780
Once we get to our new home,
you've got to study.

440
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,460
Gwak!

441
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,850
This time, you just have to
memorize all the answers.

442
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:45,820
It'll be easy.

443
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,950
All right, begin!

444
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,640
I'm counting on you, Anya.

445
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,710
You can do it.

446
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,080
This is so hard!

447
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,680
I don't know any of these answers!
This is so hard!

448
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,110
I don't know any of these answers!

449
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,200
Um... eeny, meeny, miny, moe...

450
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,000
Mommy...

451
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:28,210
K-212...

452
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,010
It's there! You passed!

453
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,510
You did it!

454
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,700
Did I do a good job?

455
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,020
You bet you did!

456
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,650
You—

457
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,520
Papa!

458
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:43,040
I relaxed for a second and all my
pent-up exhaustion hit me at once.

459
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,990
I... relaxed?

460
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,930
What the hell is going on with me?

461
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,000
Papa died.

462
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,990
I've got some mail for you!

463
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,460
Is this the Forger residence?

464
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,390
I'm Anya Forger.

465
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,200
Could you give this to your mommy or daddy?

466
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,600
My mama doesn't exist.

467
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,740
Oh, really? I'm sorry...

468
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,870
Papa! The mailman came.

469
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:30,820
What do you think you're doing?!
Are you trying to kill me?!

470
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,800
I actually fell asleep in front of someone.

471
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,340
Unacceptable. I need to get a grip.

472
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,330
Mail!

473
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,030
It's a letter from Eden College.

474
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,470
What's the matter, Papa?

475
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,360
"The second phase of the admission
process is a family interview."

476
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,610
"It is mandatory that the applicant
attend with both parents."

477
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,870
"Absolutely no exceptions."

478
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,070
But Mama doesn't exist.
