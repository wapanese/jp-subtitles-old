1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:02,970
Today is the day.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,750
Hm? For what?

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,240
You have to ask?

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,720
It's the day Eden College announces
the admissions results.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,200
The results should be posted
at 1200 hours today.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,510
This is more nerve-racking
than I thought it'd be.

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,610
My bracelet just broke.
Why did it have to happen today?

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,670
Oh, I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,160
L-Loid, look.

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,320
Oh, come on, Yor. Black cats being
unlucky is just a superstition.

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,160
Y-You're right.

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,390
Papa...

13
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,150
What's the matter?

14
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,060
I just stepped in poop.

15
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,670
Admissions results for Eden College?

16
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,950
Ah, the thing we've got Agent Twilight doing.

17
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:51,790
Chief, peace between the East
and West hangs on Operation Strix.

18
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,680
Please take this more seriously.

19
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,080
You don't know Twilight very well, do you?

20
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,500
C-Correct, sir.

21
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:04,690
He might just be the best spy in all
of Westalis, so don't worry so much.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,050
He'll be telling us that "the sakura
blossoms bloom" soon enough.

23
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,660
What does that mean, sir?

24
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,930
It's a code phrase from the Far East.

25
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,060
It means they passed.

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,850
It's not there.

27
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,800
We failed...

28
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,610
We failed...

29
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,480
We failed.

30
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,750
L-Let's head home.

31
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,610
I-I'll make us some tea.

32
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,870
I'm sorry... It's all because I stepped in poop.

33
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,120
A moment, Forgers.

34
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,740
Master Henderson...

35
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,250
What is this?

36
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,590
Look at the very top.

37
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,890
Anya Forger...

38
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,380
That is the waiting list of successful
applicants, though rather confidential.

39
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,710
A waiting list?

40
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,930
Correct. Once her overall scores were tallied,

41
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,340
Anya Forger placed first on that waiting list.

42
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,520
If any of the current successful
applicants were to withdraw,

43
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,900
she'll immediately get into the school.

44
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,150
B-But after what we did...

45
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,820
Do you know what the number one killer
of our species on this planet is?

46
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,440
Huh?

47
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,210
It is the mosquito!

48
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,160
Yes. You saved Master Swan from
that brutal killer back there.

49
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,390
That brought your score up tremendously.

50
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,100
That's insane.

51
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,630
Stand proud, Forger.

52
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,130
Your family is worthy of our school.

53
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,530
So if even one person withdraws,
Miss Anya will get in?

54
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,620
Correct.

55
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,590
But if no one withdraws...

56
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,950
Now, about that...

57
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,380
Th-The Thorn Princess?

58
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,100
What are you doing here?

59
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,360
Secretary Zachry Feiss, I presume?

60
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,990
If it's not too much trouble,
I will be taking your life.

61
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,120
Please, no! Spare me!

62
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,500
I have a son who's just about to turn six!

63
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,020
He'll be starting at Eden College next month!

64
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,920
If I die, he won't be able to go to school!

65
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,420
I'm terribly sorry, but that's
exactly why I'm doing this.

66
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:37,950
Huh?!

67
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,090
For the sake of Miss Anya
getting into the school...

68
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,270
I need you to die!

69
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,990
You mustn't, Yor!

70
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,910
You mustn't take the life
of an innocent person, Yor!

71
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,930
Yor?

72
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,280
Oh, it's nothing.

73
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,580
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Zachry Feiss.

74
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,000
Well, no matter.

75
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,270
There are a few that withdraw every year.

76
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,690
Make sure you are properly
prepared for the eventuality.

77
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,320
Thank you very much, Master Henderson.

78
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,950
I must warn you that I may not be
teaching here by the time you arrive.

79
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,620
What?

80
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,000
I was forced to give that
swine a good thrashing.

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,810
I was able to protect Eden's honor,
but who knows what ramifications await me?

82
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,530
That foolish man and this instructor...

83
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,680
I'm not sure which one will be
more useful to me in my mission,

84
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,500
but if that fool stands in my way,
I have plenty of ways to destroy him.

85
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,270
Please let me know if there's
anything I can do to help.

86
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,340
I appreciate the attempt at
consolation, my elegant boy.

87
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,310
Just await that call at home.

88
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,920
Anya will be accepted...

89
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,730
Anya will be accepted...

90
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,080
What in the world is she doing?

91
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,240
Apparently, she's performing a prayer
dance to help her get accepted.

92
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
Oh... I see.

93
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,180
Hello, Forger residence.

94
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:02,820
Yes.

95
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,490
Yes.

96
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,920
Goodbye.

97
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,780
Anya got in!

98
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,360
Papa! I passed!

99
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,180
You did a great job, Anya!

100
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,200
I did it!

101
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,630
Oh, thank goodness! What wonderful news!

102
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,930
I'm so happy!

103
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,960
Thank you for all you did as well, Yor.

104
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,230
Heya. I heard she got in.

105
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,650
Time to celebrate!

106
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,230
You sure found out fast.

107
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,540
Never underestimate an informant.

108
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,790
Oh, you must be the missus.
Pleasure to meet you!

109
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,250
I'm Loid's friend, Franky!

110
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,300
Hello.

111
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,450
Scruffy-scruff!

112
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:51,290
Let's get this party started! I got
some booze, and I ordered delivery!

113
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,250
Who do you think you are?

114
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,520
This is all thanks to me
stealing the answer sheet.

115
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,470
You idiot! They'll hear you!

116
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,790
Huh? Wha wuz zat?

117
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,250
Are you even drinking, you party pooper?

118
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:08,980
Leave me be.

119
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,610
Isn't it great, Anya?

120
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,970
Daddy said he'll buy you anything
as a reward just for today!

121
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,140
Hey! Don't go promising her things like that!

122
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,120
I don't want you to buy me anything,
but I wanna do something!

123
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,660
Hm? What's that?

124
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,490
I don't mind as long as it's doable.

125
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,670
Save me, Bondman!

126
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,980
Good morning, Bondman.

127
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:36,290
Your mission today is to save
the kidnapped Princess Honey,

128
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,940
and take back the castle.

129
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,340
Wait for me, Princess Honey!

130
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,770
The kingdom's best spy infiltrates the castle...

131
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,140
Bondman!

132
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,150
Taking down any enemy that stands in his way,

133
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,020
he finally makes it to the princess.

134
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,740
I'm here to save you, Princess Honey!

135
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,080
Bondman!

136
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,050
Peace was restored to the castle,
and their love continued to grow.

137
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,750
This is what I wanna do.

138
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,890
What you wanna do? Wait, you mean...

139
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,230
I wanna play "save Anya from the castle"!

140
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,200
Nope. Not happening.

141
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,240
How cruel... You meanie!

142
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,560
I'm not going to school if you don't do this!

143
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,290
No one asked you to speak for her.
I'm not going to school if you don't do this!

144
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,170
No one asked you to speak for her.

145
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,300
Oh, hey. I'm pretty sure that's Newston Castle.

146
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,220
I heard it was recently remodeled
into some cartoon's theme park,

147
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,360
but that's definitely it.

148
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,850
It's got the same kinds of
tricks and traps seen in the show,

149
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,220
and you can even rent it out.

150
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,540
The government doesn't have any
eyes over there, Loidy Boy,

151
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,030
so it wouldn't hurt to have a little bit of fun.

152
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,170
But...

153
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,650
After everything she went through to pass, too.

154
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,870
Doesn't seem fair if you can't get
some kind of reward, huh, kiddo?

155
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,800
Sniffle...

156
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,610
All right, fine.

157
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,430
Right, then! Let's strike while the iron's hot!

158
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,810
Leave the castle reservation to me.
You're in charge of our ride!

159
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,510
Wha?! You expect us to go today?

160
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,080
And you want <i>me</i> to arrange this?

161
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,240
Well, of course! It's for your daughter!

162
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,600
We have a message from Twilight.

163
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,020
Code GO005.

164
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,900
He did it.

165
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,270
"The sakura blossoms bloom."

166
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,690
Another message from Twilight.

167
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,460
What is it?

168
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,260
How shall I reply?

169
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,340
He might just be the best
spy in all of Westalis...

170
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,900
Get him what he needs at once!

171
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,760
Yes, ma'am!

172
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,010
To Falcon in the Rhynnick region.

173
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,420
Emergency operation from Twilight.

174
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,900
Falcon here. Roger the emergency
operation from Twilight, over.

175
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,650
"1830 hours... Meet downstream on the
Nein River in the Rhynnick region."

176
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,930
They sure didn't waste any time.

177
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,240
Believe it or not, this castle can do this, too!

178
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,160
I'm gonna make a quiz!

179
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,690
Hey, great idea!

180
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,110
You seriously came through!

181
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,650
Anya's never been on a
plane before! It's so exciting!

182
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,160
There we go.

183
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,130
Does Anya look cool?

184
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,880
Yes, you do.

185
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,550
Loid! Where did you get this li'l plane?

186
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,380
It's amazing!

187
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,050
Oh, some wonderful coworkers of
mine are letting me borrow it.

188
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,730
Fank you for always looking
after my husband.

189
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,840
You all have your seatbelts on? Here we go.

190
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,140
Let's go!

191
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,950
I'm so excited!

192
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,520
Yahoo!

193
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,080
Oh, it's so pretty.

194
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,920
It looks like a tweasure chest.

195
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,050
Papa, you're amazing!

196
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,210
Look! There it is!

197
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,210
Holy crap!

198
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,090
The castle's so cool!

199
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,790
Hey, settle down!

200
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,380
We're about to land.
Make sure you're properly seated.

201
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,340
We're in a castle!

202
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,270
You don't need to go running around with her!

203
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,730
This is wonderful.

204
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What's the matter?

205
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,780
Something's not right.

206
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,500
What do you mean by that?

207
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,860
Can you truly call a castle
with no enemies or servants

208
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,010
a castle?

209
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,200
I'm sad.

210
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,500
I don't think I can go to school now.

211
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,500
I know, right? I can't blame ya, little missy.

212
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,810
Daddy better step up his game.

213
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,300
We have a report from Twilight.

214
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,020
He's requesting agents.

215
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,460
As many as possible.

216
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,950
This will be a true test for WISE.

217
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,720
To all agents in Ostania.

218
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,990
Report to Newston Castle
for an emergency operation.

219
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,660
This is an extremely important
assignment regarding Operation Strix.

220
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,870
Mission rank is over SS.

221
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,980
I repeat: this is an extremely important
assignment regarding Operation Strix.

222
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,200
Mission rank is over SS!

223
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,670
That's the real Twilight...

224
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,880
I gotta get his autograph later.

225
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,610
Look at your agency coming through for you.

226
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,440
Well, give them the rundown.

227
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,330
I'll explain the rest.

228
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,430
All right, fine.

229
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:37,060
Thank you very much for gathering
here today on behalf of my daughter.

230
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,260
Morse code.

231
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,040
"Just listen quietly."

232
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,910
Orders from Twilight!

233
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,140
I would like for all of you to
play the part of the enemies

234
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,950
of a spy who is coming to save a princess.

235
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,650
I have absolutely no idea what's going on...

236
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:56,260
But this is Twilight we're talking about.
I'm sure this is all according to plan.

237
00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:00,490
Thank you again for doing
this for my daughter.

238
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,530
All right! Let's announce the cast!

239
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,830
Here's our star for today!

240
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,360
Princess Anya!

241
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,210
This is the spy person who's gonna save me!

242
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,730
Loidman!

243
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,330
And the big bad boss!

244
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:18,480
Scruffy!
And the big bad boss!

245
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,790
Count Scruffy Head!
Scruffy!

246
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:19,980
Count Scruffy Head!

247
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,740
And Mama... um...

248
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,160
can be whatever.

249
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,140
Shock!

250
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,630
And now...

251
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,440
to the very capable subordinates
of Count Scruffy Head!

252
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,400
I need you all to put on
your best performances

253
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,210
and get in Loidman's
way as much as possible!

254
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,510
Uh... wait...

255
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,780
This mission ranking is over SS.

256
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,630
I'll make any sacrifice necessary
to see this mission through!

257
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,710
I couldn't ask for a better
opponent than Twilight!

258
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,960
This day has finally come...

259
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,280
You can all decide for yourselves how
you're going to get in Loidman's way.

260
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,140
I am not exaggerating when I say the
success of this plan is in your hands!

261
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,400
Uh... Where is this going?

262
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,980
My loyal minions!

263
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,240
Make Loidman suffer as much as
possible for Princess Anya's sake!

264
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,890
Once you're all prepared,
get to your positions!

265
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:08,770
Roger!

266
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,820
Scruffy, scruffy, scruffy, scruff!
Princess Anya is mine!

267
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,210
If you want her back, come after me!

268
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,940
Save me, Loidman.

269
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,790
Wait, it's already started?!

270
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,650
Hey!

271
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:39,270
Loidman! You are about to face many
obstacles in order to get the princess back!

272
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,250
First up,

273
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,270
we have a quiz that the princess made
up in this courtyard, so listen up!

274
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:47,020
If you can't answer correctly,
you'll be putting that on!

275
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,740
This is...

276
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,380
You betcha! A Bondman costume set!

277
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,490
So exciting!
You betcha! A Bondman costume set!

278
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,230
Okay, question time!

279
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,860
What does Princess Anya like about Bondman?!

280
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,030
Huh? His face?

281
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:04,080
Bzzz! The fact that he has
a pistol with a silencer!

282
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,290
What? Really?!

283
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:09,880
Oh, come on! You're her dad
and you don't even know that?

284
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,420
Next question!

285
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,110
What's Anya's favorite food?

286
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:14,680
Peanuts!

287
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,000
Ooh! Correct!

288
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,110
Tch. Guess that was too easy.

289
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,200
Here's the final question!

290
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,270
If you get it wrong, you'll be
changing into that outfit, Loidman!

291
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,200
That's <i>if</i> I don't get it.

292
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,270
Here's your question, then.

293
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,890
What does Anya want right now?

294
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,710
What does she want right now?

295
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,880
Five! Four!

296
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,780
You didn't say anything about a time limit!

297
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,250
I never said there wouldn't be one, either.

298
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,620
Calm down. What does Anya want right now?

299
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,930
What does she want...

300
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,460
Bondman's spy gear!

301
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,170
What's the correct answer, Princess Anya?!

302
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,760
Right now...

303
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,780
I'm thirsty, so I'd like some water, please!

304
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,100
Looks like you're wrong, Loidman!

305
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,570
How the hell would I know that?!
Looks like you're wrong, Loidman!

306
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,690
Scruffy, scruffy, scruffy, scruff!
How the hell would I know that?!

307
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,240
Scruffy, scruffy, scruffy, scruff!

308
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,430
Too bad for you, Loidman!

309
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,190
Now, let's have you keep your word!

310
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,110
I'm <i>so</i> excited...

311
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,440
to see the <i>real</i> Loidman!

312
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,960
Loidman!

313
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,110
All right, then! On to the next stage!

314
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,540
Hey, wait!

315
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,360
Loidman!

316
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,070
If you want to save Princess Anya,
you'll have to make your way up here!

317
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,870
Scruffy, scruffy, scruffy, scruff!

318
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,010
He's so cool!

319
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,770
He's just so amazing...

320
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,370
You're so cool, Loidman!

321
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,060
We're just getting started, scruff!

322
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,060
Oh, no. Save me.

323
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,150
God, this is a pain.

324
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,240
Loidman! Up here, up here!

325
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,910
I'm right here!

326
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,350
There's no end to this.

327
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,180
This is so cool!

328
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,610
You've got this, my minions!
Don't let him win!

329
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,550
Loid! Let them hit you, damn it!

330
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,270
Now you've done it, you bastard!

331
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,670
Don't think you're gonna catch us that easily!

332
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,050
Buh-bye!

333
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,530
Save me, Loidman.

334
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,040
You're so amazing, Loidman!

335
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,260
Scruffy, scruffy, scruffy, scruff!
I'm impressed you got this far, Loidman!

336
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,010
But I won't let you have the princess!

337
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,580
Save me, Loidman!

338
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,890
Are you seriously telling me
I have to act out this embarrassing

339
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,480
little play in front of all of these agents?

340
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,820
But in the end... this is for the mission!

341
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,540
H... Hand over the princess.

342
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,450
Ooh!

343
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,440
I can't believe we get to see
Twilight's acting skills in person!

344
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,370
You fool! You think I'd
hand her over that easily?!

345
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,360
Now, go! The most powerful
witch in the world, Yorticia!

346
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,450
Finish off that fool, scruff!

347
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,250
Now there's a witch?!

348
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,010
What the hell is going on in this story?

349
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:05,770
Huh?

350
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,950
Wai—no way. What?!

351
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,230
Anyone who tries to kidnap Miss Anya...

352
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,360
will not get away alive!

353
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,580
Y-Yor, please calm down.

354
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,320
Why is she using physical
attacks when she's a witch?

355
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,170
She's strong!

356
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,320
She's gonna kill me!

357
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,450
Yor... Are you all right?

358
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,940
Scruffy, scruffy, scruffy, scruff!

359
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,720
Excellent work getting this far, Loidman!

360
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,690
But you won't defeat me that easil—

361
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,060
So exciting!

362
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,100
I... I've come to save you, Princess Anya.

363
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,710
Papa!

364
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,850
Wait... I'm supposed to be your dad in this?

365
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,740
So sparkly!

366
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,050
Congratulations, Anya!

367
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,260
Anya...

368
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,210
Congratulations...

369
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,340
What is this?

370
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,240
I've had so much excitement
ever since I left the orphanage!

371
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,650
It's all thanks to you, Papa!

372
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,070
Hm? Oh... I'm happy for you.

373
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,450
I'm gonna do my best in school!

374
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,320
That's good.

375
00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:00,220
Well, anyway... congratulations
on getting into the school.

376
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,600
Sir, the expense report from Agent Twilight.

377
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,730
Are these numbers real?

378
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,210
Yes, they are.

379
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:22,940
But...

380
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,680
They are correct.
