1
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,260
It's a shame you can't see the stars in Aincrad.

2
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,930
But this view isn't so bad.

3
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,810
I've never seen a shooting star.

4
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,100
Where I live in the real world,
the night sky's too bright.

5
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,310
Oh yeah? Didn't know you're a city girl.

6
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,190
Come on, Kirito, don't tease me!

7
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:14,440
In my hometown,
there's a pretty famous stargazing spot.

8
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,360
There's even a small observatory.

9
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,780
Then let's promise to go see a meteor shower there someday!

10
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,410
Sure, someday.

11
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,540
To do that, we have to survive and clear this game.

12
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,250
Yeah.

13
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,170
And then I'll give you a ring
in the real world, too.

14
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,470
<i>On November 6, 2022,</i>

15
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,010
<i>10,000 players of Sword Art Online,</i>

16
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,850
<i>a game produced for the NerveGear,
a full-dive virtual reality device,</i>

17
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,060
<i>discovered on launch day that,
because of developer Akihiko Kayaha,</i>

18
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,940
<i>it was impossible to log out.</i>

19
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:38,860
<i>They were trapped in a cruel death game,
where "Game Over" meant dying in the real world.</i>

20
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,620
<i>Amid an overwhelming sense of despair,
some took up their swords to clear the game,</i>

21
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,250
<i>while others, succumbing to fear,
cut off all contact.</i>

22
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,710
<i>And there were those who killed other players.</i>

23
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,050
<i>And then, what seemed like an eternity went by.</i>

24
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,720
<i>Until two years later, on November 7, 2024,</i>

25
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,890
<i>thanks to the heroics of one player,</i>

26
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,140
<i>the game was finally cleared and everyone was freed.</i>

27
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,570
<i>In the end, 4,000 people lost their lives,</i>

28
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,900
<i>and with the death of mastermind Akihiko Kayaba,</i>

29
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,450
<i>the incident drew to a close.</i>

30
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,950
<i>The players who returned alive
are known as SAO survivors,</i>

31
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,540
<i>and now, they're returning to
their normal lives in the real world.</i>

32
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,050
The Complete SAO Incident Records

33
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,830
Um, excuse me?

34
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,200
What are those devices
you have on your ears?

35
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,800
<i>Welcome to Augma!</i>

36
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,140
As you can see, its popularity has exploded
immediately upon launch!

37
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,020
Let's discuss this next-generation wearable device,
the Augma.

38
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,230
Since the Augma lacks a full-dive function,

39
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,320
you might assume it's taken a step back
compared to its predecessor, the Amusphere,

40
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,990
but you'd be mistaken!

41
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,620
You could say it's a huge advantage
to be able to use it while conscious.

42
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,910
The Amusphere, which enables you
to full dive into the virtual world,

43
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,080
and AR, or rather, the Augma,
which augments reality,

44
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,000
should be considered to be
two totally different things.

45
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,210
You're absolutely right.

46
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:02,920
Most importantly, the Augma doesn't possess
the inherent risks of a full-dive machine.

47
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,930
In fact, there's been a surge in users
who wear it for fitness and health monitoring.

48
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,930
And one such example
is the latest game, Ordinal Scale.

49
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,770
Make Every Day an Adventure!

50
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:19,520
Ordinal Scale's defining feature is its ranking system.

51
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,190
Every player is given a number
that reflects their rank,

52
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,320
and as they play the game,
their rank increases.

53
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,370
When this number reaches the upper tiers,
you can receive various services

54
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,790
from participating companies
in the real world.

55
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,620
Now this is amazing.

56
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,880
There are discounts from a major online retailers
and access to premiere tickets.

57
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,590
There are exclusive shopping sites,

58
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,260
and even a coupon
for a free extra-large beef bowl.

59
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,760
Pretty tantalizing for young users!

60
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,470
Who knows what amazing benefit you'll get
if you reach No. 1?

61
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,730
The drones, launched right after the start
of the service to relieve the strain on the network,

62
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,690
now seem to be part of a new landscape.

63
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,490
And contributing to the game's growing popularity,
is its image character, Yuna.

64
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,490
Debuting as the world's first AR idol,
Yuna is an AI controlled by a program,

65
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,250
but as her speech and expressions
are so astonishingly natural,

66
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,750
there are constant rumors
that a real human is actually playing her.

67
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,090
Well, that mysterious aspect
might just be one reason for her popularity.

68
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,460
Actually, I'm Yuna's--

69
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,470
Uh, word is she'll be performing
her first live concert at the end of this month,

70
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,180
but the 30,000 tickets for the event
sold out instantly.

71
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,930
I finally managed to get some
after going through various routes--

72
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,480
The momentum of the Augma and Ordinal Scale
is only going to accelerate!

73
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,110
@ New National Stadium Arena
See you all there!

74
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,490
All right! We cleared it!

75
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,210
You did it, Silica! Nice assist, Liz!

76
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,370
That got us 100 points!

77
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,960
It says we get free cake! Lucky us!

78
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,760
Don't you think you're playing games
a little too much?

79
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,680
I-I never thought
you'd be the one telling us that, Kirito!

80
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,220
Well, you can get points from all kinds of shops.
So we might as well play, right?

81
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,390
Can't you just admit
you wanted to play with us?

82
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,230
Anyway, it's really convenient, isn't it?

83
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,190
We can watch TV anywhere we go,
it's easier to navigate than a smartphone,

84
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,650
the weather report's a total lifesaver,
and best of all, we can talk with Yui!

85
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,570
Yes!

86
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,530
It seems like you’re really into it, Liz.

87
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,830
Well, I wouldn't say that.

88
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,290
But hey, since they handed them out
to all students at the survivors' school,

89
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,290
we can at least try it out
for a bit, you know?

90
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,540
Thank you for waiting!

91
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,590
This is the clear bonus set.

92
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,970
I want this one!

93
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,220
The AI even knows what we'd like, huh?

94
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,480
What was it called, "Deep Learning"?

95
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,110
That's what you call thoughtful.
Unlike someone else we know...

96
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,190
I hear that the AI also collects data
on what you eat.

97
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,200
This may be bad. You're
consuming too many calories!

98
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,450
Liz! What's the matter?

99
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,550
How much more until the goal point?

100
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,420
About halfway.

101
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,130
It's tough for princesses,
not being able to have a part-time job.

102
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,630
No! It's not like that!

103
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,260
It's exciting to get a present
for Kirito, isn't it?

104
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,800
Yep. I'll do my best!

105
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,180
Asuna?

106
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:47,980
Who knew they'd give the entire survivors' school
free tickets to Yuna's first live concert?

107
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,820
How is attending a concert a class?

108
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,610
I know! That school is pretty strange, isn't it?

109
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,160
Well, lucky you, since you're a huge Yuna fan!

110
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,450
H-Hey, I'm not that big of a fan!

111
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,870
But you were belting out Yuna songs
with Suguha the other day at karaoke!

112
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,500
Go on! You should let everyone else hear, too!

113
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,830
You were so good!

114
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,800
Hey, Kirito, you're going
to Yuna's concert, too, right?

115
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:59,760
I'm not sure. I'm not much of a fan.

116
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,560
We should all go together!

117
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,020
Well, if I feel up for it.

118
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:11,440
I have to admit,
this thing seems like a neat gadget.

119
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,320
But I still like full-dive better.

120
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,650
Is that so?

121
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,490
Well, after being totally immersed
in another world for three years, yeah.

122
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,080
Don't tell me you want to go back.

123
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,710
That reminds me! Speaking of Aincrad,
I wonder if those rumors are true?

124
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,170
You know, that boss monsters from the old SAO
are showing up in Ordinal Scale?

125
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,420
Oh, right.

126
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,590
You mean those mysterious event battles.

127
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,180
Are they some kind of promotion?

128
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,430
I don't know, but since they keep
the locations secret till the last minute,

129
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,850
it's hard to get there in time
without a ride.

130
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,480
I wonder what's really going on?

131
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,320
So all we need is a way to get there, right?

132
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,450
Klein:
Let's do an OS boss raid together!

133
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,280
Kirito!

134
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,970
Looks like we made it just in time.

135
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,810
The location was just announced a half hour ago,
but there's already a pretty big crowd here.

136
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,230
I guess there's that many more players now.

137
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,320
What took you so long, Kirito?

138
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,820
Oh, Asuna's here, too!

139
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,910
Since Kirito wasn't that into it,
I had to drag him along.

140
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,820
Also, I won rock-paper-scissors!

141
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,910
Okay then.

142
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,160
All right!
Let's show Asuna what we're made of!

143
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,080
- Kirito, it's almost time.
- O-Okay.

144
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,760
- Ordinal Scale, activate!
- Ordinal Scale, activate!

145
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,470
That's...

146
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,220
The boss monster from floor 10 in Aincrad,
Kagachi the Samurai Lord!

147
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,060
He looks exactly like the SAO boss!

148
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,480
We can't use our sword skills now.

149
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,230
But if his attack patterns
are the same as before...

150
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,530
Y-Yuna?

151
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,490
Are you guys ready?

152
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,000
All right, let the battle begin!
Music, start!

153
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,420
All right! Yuna's started singing!
It's a special stage with a bonus!

154
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,110
I'm gonna piss myself!

155
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,360
Is this a death game?

156
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,950
That thing is huge!

157
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,950
What do you say, Kirito?

158
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,370
Wait! Time out! Time out!

159
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,600
Crap!

160
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,230
Hey! At zero HP, there's a penalty!

161
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,690
I know that!

162
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,440
Guns didn't work after all.

163
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,150
But I'd be scared to fight in close combat.

164
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,740
All right!

165
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,240
The bonus is ours!

166
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,670
I sot it!

167
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,210
Nice block!

168
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,670
Tank!

169
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,050
I'll deflect it!

170
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:11,450
Good. Eight of them, huh?

171
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,250
My body feels heavy.
This is definitely different from the virtual world.

172
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,920
It's targeting you!

173
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,340
Kirito!

174
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,380
Ouch!

175
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,140
No joke, it's so hard to move!

176
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,890
That's cause you're out of shape!

177
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,770
I'm just getting started!

178
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,060
What is he doing?

179
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,650
The last attack is mine!

180
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,070
Crap!

181
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,890
Wow!

182
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,390
Rank 2?

183
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,770
Here comes his ultimate move!
Tanks, follow me!

184
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,450
Hey, not bad! All right!

185
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,450
Okay! Me, too!

186
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,720
Retreat for now!

187
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,860
All right!

188
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,660
Switch.

189
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,580
Get him!

190
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,350
That was awesome!

191
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,440
Congratulations on defeating the boss monster!

192
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,940
I just boosted your points big time!

193
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,030
Now I'm going to reward the player
who did the most tonight!

194
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,320
All right!

195
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,790
You're today's MVP! Congratulations!

196
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,210
All right. See you later!

197
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,220
Good job, Asuna.

198
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,520
The No. 2 ranked player, huh?
There's some amazing people out there.

199
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,020
My ranking shot up
just from this one boss battle. Look!

200
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,490
- Gotta hand it to those SAO bosses!
- Man, it'll be chaotic if all the users find out!

201
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,080
Huh? Looks like you barely moved up at all.

202
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,830
Be quiet. I'll leave these raids to you.

203
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,210
- Make sure Asuna gets home okay.
- I know that!

204
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,170
If he takes you somewhere strange,
give me a call. I'll come rescue you.

205
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,420
Okay!

206
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,690
An item in a place like this!

207
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,610
You're that guy from the event.

208
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,410
What, are you hunting items?

209
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,500
Don’t get cocky 'cause you're No. 2.
It won't go as easy as you think.

210
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,470
Friday, April 24, 2026
⏤ Inside ALO, New Aincrad, Floor 22 ⏤

211
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,220
Man, the floor boss's attack patterns in AR
may have been the same as the original,

212
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:48,930
but fighting with our real bodies
made me sore all over!

213
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,560
I'm surprised such a small party beat it.

214
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,230
Well, Asuna and I already fought it once before.

215
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,270
But the other players
were inexperienced in group battles,

216
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,820
so it was an uphill battle.

217
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,490
And you were totally wiped out, too, Kirito!

218
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,780
I wasn't used to AR battles, that's all.

219
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,960
Oh, but that Yuna girl showed up to cheer us on,
and at the very end, as a reward--

220
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,750
Big Brother, you mean
you fought a boss battle with Yuna?

221
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,130
Is that true?

222
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,420
- Big Brother!
- Kirito!

223
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,590
I'm just glad I got to see her sing live.

224
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,840
I forgot to put my name down
for one of Yuna's concert tickets.

225
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,640
That's right, I scored a pair of tickets
during the Ordinal Scale registration campaign.

226
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,310
I did, too.

227
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,980
- What? Lucky you!
- What? Lucky you!

228
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,110
All right! I'll give you one of mine!

229
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,030
- Stare.
- And I'll give one to you, Leafa.

230
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,990
- Yay!
- Yay!

231
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,580
Oh, but I actually have
kendo boot camp next week.

232
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,710
Still, I wonder what's going on.

233
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:01,510
The bosses from the old SAO showing up
in Ordinal Scale event battles?

234
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,630
There hasn't been a tie-in campaign, right?

235
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:11,020
No. And even if they wanted to do a tie-in,
Argus, the company that ran SAO, is gone.

236
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,850
Were the other players in the event
aware it was an SAO boss?

237
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,480
It didn't seem like they were.

238
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,610
I think only we were familiar
with that boss's attack patterns.

239
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,780
<i>Switch.</i>

240
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,200
What do you think, Kirito?

241
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,040
Yeah. It's probably like you said.

242
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,880
But if the old SAO bosses keep showing up,
more players are sure to catch on.

243
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,250
After all, you get a lot of points.

244
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,670
You mean they're trying to reproduce Aincrad
in the real world?

245
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,680
But your life isn't at risk
like with the NerveGear, is it?

246
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,850
You're overthinking it.

247
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,680
Anyway, Yui, let me know
if you find out anything.

248
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,730
Okay, Daddy!

249
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,900
If I can fight by Yuna's side,
I want to join the events, too!

250
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,270
Hey, me too!

251
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,900
Next time I'm gonna ride double
with Kirito for sure...

252
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:06,200
I wish they'd schedule these events
when it'd be easier for us to join in.

253
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,870
For you ladies in such a plight,
us guys in Furinkazan will happily drive you.

254
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,620
We'll pick you up!

255
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,700
That would worry me more!

256
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,750
Hey, now.

257
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,170
Yuna...

258
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,050
What's the matter, Yuna?

259
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,460
What is this thing?

260
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,550
It's proof that your singing thrilled everybody.

261
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,340
Oh, is that so?

262
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:33,310
And we'll get even more soon...

263
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,930
by getting revenge on every one of them.

264
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,440
Okay, Big Brother, I'm heading out now!

265
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,610
Okay. See you later.

266
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,240
You're still in that outfit?

267
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,580
Yeah, well. I've got some research to do
on my plans for after graduation.

268
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,120
It's good that you're researching colleges,

269
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,960
but why don't you swing a shinai
or exercise once in a while?

270
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,250
Yeah, yeah. If I ever feel like it, I will.

271
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,670
- Don't forget my souvenir.
- Seriously!

272
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,970
You know, you should use this more often.

273
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,630
They even offer gym coupons!

274
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,930
See ya!

275
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,660
Shigemura Lab: Creators of the Augma

276
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,290
AR really is everywhere, huh?

277
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,880
Link start!

278
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:02,190
Hey, Asuna. You're here.

279
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,060
Hi, Kirito.

280
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,440
Where's Leafa?

281
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,690
Oh, Sugu just left for her boot camp.

282
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,360
It's going to be lonely.

283
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:14,530
True. It's gonna be tough
without her waking me up in the morning.

284
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,620
Really...

285
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,410
Make sure you eat something, okay?

286
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,410
Sure. I can cook for myself, you know.

287
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,210
I worry about you.

288
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:27,420
Once you're focused on something,
you forget to eat, you know?

289
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,920
Daddy's go-to meal is
plain pepperoncino pasta, after all.

290
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,260
No need for that much detail.

291
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,390
Kirito, about what we discussed the other day,

292
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,350
my mother says she'd like to meet you.

293
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,190
Well, one of these days.

294
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,270
Right.

295
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,950
The next ALO event quest has been postponed.

296
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,280
I see.

297
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:02,580
In the last two weeks,
there's been a 30% drop in logins, Mommy.

298
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,380
I guess everybody's busy with Ordinal Scale.

299
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,090
You may be right.
But I'm sure they'll come back eventually.

300
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,760
Yeah.

301
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:40,080
Klein: Today's boss raid is near your house.
You wanna join us? Here's the details.

302
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,120
Open on map

303
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,290
Yoyogi Park

304
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,210
I'm heading out, okay?

305
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,640
Hey! Asuna!

306
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:05,730
Over here!

307
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:10,770
Sorry to drag you out here.
You weren't asleep, were you?

308
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,280
No, I was just taking a bath
and rushed right over.

309
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,990
Huh? You're not all here yet?

310
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:22,280
We can't get ahold of one of our members.

311
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,700
We'll jump in once we're all here,
so go on ahead.

312
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,620
All right.

313
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:30,580
If you're late, then I'm going to
earn all of your points, okay?

314
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,420
That's cold, Asuna!

315
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:04,790
Are you guys ready?

316
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,250
All right, let the battle begin!
Music, start!

317
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,550
Holy crap! Yuna showed up!

318
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,010
We gotta get going!

319
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:25,310
Damn, he's not answering my texts.

320
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:30,100
- We'd better go or today's prey will--
- No. Today's prey is you!

321
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,610
Why is it here?

322
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:46,030
Oh, a new song! How lucky!

323
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
As expected.

324
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,550
I can see why they were
one of the Assault Teams.

325
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:10,480
But...

326
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,310
I'm going to show you
the difference between AR and VR!

327
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,360
All right!

328
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,860
Score! The bonus is ours!

329
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,450
There's no pain like this in VR, right?

330
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,670
You bastard! What the hell are you doing?

331
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,510
Hey, now. What a buzzkill.

332
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:46,850
Damn you!

333
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,520
Hey, let's have some fun.

334
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,960
Here. You forgot something.

335
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,880
Keep your eyes open.

336
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,140
That motion...

337
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:14,020
A wide-range attack is coming!
Tanks, draw its attention!

338
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,020
R-Right!

339
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:20,360
It'll use its ultimate move soon,
so aim for its wings when it hovers!

340
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,730
Uh, right!

341
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,360
Let's finish it off once it's shot down!

342
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,110
Gotcha!

343
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,490
Fire!

344
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,960
- Now's our chance!
- Right!

345
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,510
Oh, no!

346
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,320
Hey, you're amazing.

347
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,910
Nice direction!

348
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,200
Do you have experience from other games?

349
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,500
W-Well... Th-Thanks!

350
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,790
So it's you again!

351
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,250
Congrats!

352
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,040
Oh, what a pity.

353
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,510
Well...

354
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,510
See you later, Asuna.

355
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,680
Lightning Flash Asuna...

356
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:40,020
Ordinal Scale is a truly realistic MMO game
where players are free from the fear of death.

357
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,190
And that's where I'll demonstrate my true power.

358
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,590
And now here's the latest on Ordinal Scale,
the AR game everyone's talking about.

359
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:15,890
We hear that bosses from Sword Art Online's
Old Aincrad have appeared in its event battles.

360
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:20,310
Apparently, you can haul in a ton of points
in the boss raids.

361
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:24,600
Not only that, but the odds there'll be
a live performance by Yuna are extremely high!

362
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,820
What I wouldn't give to rank up
and earn enough to cover my internet fees!

363
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,320
Now, now.

364
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:34,530
Also, due to "The Complete SAO Incident Records"
being published last month,

365
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:40,160
it seems there's been a surge in those wanting
to relive Sword Art Online, now shut down.

366
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,370
So people are jumping on the bandwagon
after the fact, huh?

367
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,040
That's why, along with the increase
in Augma users,

368
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:53,720
there's been a downturn in logins
for mainstream VR games like ALO and GGO.

369
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,720
Is everyone bored of VR?

370
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:03,440
I couldn't say for sure, but we have
some of the show's past guests live right now.

371
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,440
Here you go!

372
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:14,000
Salamander Race - Eugene

373
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:11,340
In the next ALO duel tournament
I'd like to face players who pose a threat to me.

374
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,440
But they may as well
declare me the winner.

375
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,500
You didn't win last time, did you now?

376
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,500
Cait Sith Leader - Alicia Rue

377
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:21,440
We're extremely attached to this place,
so we have no plans to uproot ourselves.

378
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:21,440
"Sleeping Knights" Guild Member - Siune

379
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:25,370
Lately, the number of players
in Sylph territory has been plunging.

380
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:33,780
Sylph Leader - Sakuya

381
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,460
It's a shame, as we're no longer able
to hold major events.

382
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,420
But I'm not worried about a thing.

383
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,780
I'm sure everyone will be back someday.

384
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,550
Fukajiro, where have you gone?

385
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,970
I mean, I even got my hands
on a new grenade launcher just for you!

386
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,730
- L-Leafa!
- Come back!

387
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,730
We apologize for the unseemly images.

388
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:50,320
<i>Uh, and last but not least,
a really big guest is unexpectedly here!</i>

389
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,150
<i>Enjoy!</i>

390
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,280
<i>Goad evening, everybody!</i>

391
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,660
<i>Only four more days till my first live arena show!</i>

392
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,990
<i>I hope you're all looking forward to it!</i>

393
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,530
Good morning, Daddy!

394
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,950
Morning, Yui.

395
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:43,740
Where are we?

396
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,540
Oh, this is where Asuna participated
in that event battle yesterday.

397
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,250
It seems like Mommy's really giving it her all.

398
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,540
Looks like it.

399
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,460
Daddy, what's this mark?

400
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,050
Yeah, that's the day Asuna and I are going to see
a meteor shower at Mt. Doudaira.

401
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,470
That sounds lovely! I want to see it, too!

402
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,020
Of course you’re coming with us.

403
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,020
Yay! I wonder what should I wear?

404
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,940
We promised each other in SAO.
That's where Asuna and I--

405
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,070
Hey, I know, Daddy!

406
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:17,690
Why don’t you train to fight
in Ordinal Scale right now?

407
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,320
Mommy was worried about you
not getting enough exercise.

408
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,450
You'd better show her how cool you can be,
or your marriage will be in danger!

409
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,040
Ordinal Scale, activate.

410
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:39,510
There's just something off about this.
The lag is huge, or rather...

411
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:42,640
It's a different physical sensation
than virtual reality!

412
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,010
Your only option is to practice, Daddy!

413
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,560
Yui, you know what--

414
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:54,980
I'm sorry!

415
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,280
Who are you?

416
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,300
Yui, did you see that?

417
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,140
Yes.

418
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,390
She didn't have an NPC tag, but...

419
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,480
She didn't seem to be a player, either.

420
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,900
So that means... Is she an AR ghost?

421
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,310
No, that would be unscientific.

422
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,110
It would, right?

423
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,150
It looked like she was saying something.

424
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,330
Judging by how her lips moved,
it seems like she was saying, "Search."

425
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,960
Kirito! Thanks for waiting!

426
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,380
Sorry I went to the event on my own.

427
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,760
You don’t have to worry about me.

428
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:07,180
By the way, you said you'd spotted some other
SAD survivors besides us in that UDX battle?

429
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,930
Yes. That No. 2 player.

430
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,020
Oh, that guy?

431
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,400
I think he was a member
of the Knights of the Blood Oath. Probably.

432
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,190
Probably?

433
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,980
The thing is,
he's totally different than he was in SAO.

434
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:24,950
Back then, he went by the name Nautilus,
and he was diligent and had potential,

435
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,950
but he couldn't overcome his fear of death,
so he didn't take part in a single boss raid.

436
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,870
So his playing style totally changed, huh?

437
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,370
I can't believe how he moved so nimbly
in an AR game.

438
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,750
You'd think he was a gymnast.

439
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,130
You didn't talk to him?

440
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:45,010
No. Since I wasn't sure
if he'd be glad to see me in real life.

441
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,050
But since he was a fellow guild member,
I am a little concerned.

442
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,890
That's our former vice commander, huh?

443
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,270
Come on!

444
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:57,980
Hey, Asuna.

445
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,150
You've never heard any talk about ghosts
appearing in this park, have you?

446
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,650
Come on! Cut it out, will you?

447
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,530
You know I don’t like ghost stories!

448
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,740
Oh, yeah. That's right.

449
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,580
By the way, Kirito,
about that promise we made...

450
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,710
Y-Yeah ?

451
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:21,590
My mom started grilling me
about who I was going with.

452
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,460
You mean...

453
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,340
But it's all right.

454
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,220
We need to get ready, don’t we?

455
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,050
Yeah. You're right.

456
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,260
Daddy, Mommy?

457
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,600
I was able to find out one thing!

458
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,020
Everybody, please look at this.

459
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,900
So far, the boss monsters
have appeared every night at 9:00 PM.

460
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:46,280
This is where Daddy and Mommy fought
Kagachi the Samurai Lord two days ago.

461
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,030
And this is where Mommy battled last night.

462
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,580
Let me plot the locations
where the other nine monsters showed up.

463
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,460
And now I'm overlaying
a map of Old Aincrad on it.

464
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:00,750
This is...

465
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,130
The places where the boss monsters appeared
overlap with the dungeon in Old Aincrad!

466
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,880
To be precise, these are
the closest parks and plazas

467
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:12,430
to the coordinates that overlap
with the dungeon.

468
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,560
Therefore, we can make certain predictions.

469
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:20,230
I can anticipate that tonight at nine,
one will appear in Yebisu Garden Place in Shibuya!

470
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:24,980
If we know in advance where it's going to be,
I can join, too!

471
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,240
It's at night, so will that be okay?

472
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,990
As long as I'm with you guys, I'll be fine!

473
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:33,120
Funny, our parents would complain
if this was VR.

474
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,490
Well, yeah.

475
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:39,330
I'll be at work then, so I can't go.

476
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,920
Huh? Kirito, you’re not going?

477
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,750
Nah, I'm going to pass on this one.

478
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,670
What? Are you that bad at AR battles?

479
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,920
A bit.

480
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,930
Guess it can't be helped, then.

481
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,340
Bike...

482
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:58,520
All right, let's show Yuna our veteran party play!

483
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,100
- Right!
- Right!

484
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,270
By the way, where's Klein?

485
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,070
Who knows? Probably immersing himself
in Ordinal Scale somewhere?

486
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,360
Oh yeah,
I did see him before the battle yesterday,

487
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,110
but Klein never did join the event.

488
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,030
He said they were waiting on
one Furinkazan member.

489
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,410
With AR battles, it's a pain to have to
physically go to the actual venue, huh?

490
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:27,050
Speaking of which, we should pick a time to meet
when we go see the meteor shower, right?

491
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,550
Whatever. Let's discuss our plans for tonight.

492
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,800
First, let's decide where to meet up.

493
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,680
- Yui?
- Yes, Daddy?

494
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:42,020
About going to see the stars...
we're keeping it a secret from the others.

495
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,480
I'm so sorry!

496
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,810
Well, anyway,

497
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,900
could you send the bosses' location data
to my cell later?

498
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,860
Yes, I'll be sure to do that!

499
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:06,170
Klein

500
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:14,010
To: Agil Subject: Do you have a second? I
can't reach Klein. Know anything? Kazuto

501
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,640
<i>Hello? Kirito?</i>

502
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,270
Hey, Asuna.

503
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,520
Hang on a sec.

504
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,520
<i>It really is just pasta.</i>

505
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,360
For today, yeah.

506
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:32,900
That's all my cooking app ever recommends.

507
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:36,110
<i>Seriously. Your diet's going to be so unbalanced.</i>

508
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:42,410
Then make me a ragout rabbit stew
again sometime, okay?

509
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,580
<i>That's not going to be easy. Oh, I know!</i>

510
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,170
<i>I can make something similar,
so I'll get the ingredients!</i>

511
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:50,630
S-Sure. I can't wait.

512
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,380
<i>Hey, Kirito.</i>

513
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,260
<i>About that ghost you mentioned this afternoon.</i>

514
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:59,930
<i>You asked me if I'd heard
of any stories like that in Yoyogi Park.</i>

515
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,140
O-Oh, right.

516
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,100
<i>I did some digging afterwards.</i>

517
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,230
<i>This didn't happen in Yoyogi Park,</i>

518
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:10,020
<i>but lately there are rumors among the players
about the ghost of a girl wearing a hoodie.</i>

519
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,230
I-Is that right?

520
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,240
<i>Wait, did you see her, too?</i>

521
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,400
Of course not!

522
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:19,870
And I'm sure the people who said they saw her
must've mistaken an NPC for her.

523
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,870
<i>You really think so?</i>

524
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:26,080
Oh, hey!
The tent and sleeping bags I have look useable.

525
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,580
<i>Thanks!</i>

526
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,380
<i>Thank goodness you had some outdoor gear
at your place!</i>

527
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,420
<i>Tell your father thank you for me!</i>

528
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,800
Yeah, sure.

529
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,510
<i>I can't wait to see the meteor shower!</i>

530
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,810
Klein. Leader of the Furinkazan guild, huh?

531
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,310
We got a lot of them yesterday, huh?

532
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,520
I suppose so.

533
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,570
But the main dish is still yet to come.

534
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:53,820
<i>Ream?</i>

535
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,450
Does this interest you, Yuna?

536
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:01,910
Nothing but text. Is it a difficult book?

537
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:04,620
No. It's like a journal of my memories.

538
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:10,790
"If he draws his second sword,
no one will remain standing." it says.

539
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,130
What is this? It's so cool! Read it to me, Eiji!

540
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,180
The Black Swordsman "If he draws his second
sword, no one will remain standing."

541
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,830
YOU WIN!
YOU GET A FREE DRINK COUPON!!

542
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,900
So we meet at last, huh?

543
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,480
Have you been looking for me?

544
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,650
You don’t seem to be a ghost.

545
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,530
Who are you, anyway?

546
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,080
Is there something you want me to search for?

547
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,000
Hey!

548
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,260
Hello?

549
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,760
<i>You finally picked up!</i>

550
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,640
Oh, my bad. I was driving. What's up?

551
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,390
<i>It's Klein.</i>

552
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:49,390
<i>He's been in a hospital in Yoyogi
since last night.</i>

553
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:51,430
<i>Apparently his arm was broken.</i>

554
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,060
What? Was he in an accident or something?

555
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,610
<i>I don't have all the details,</i>

556
00:44:56,690 --> 00:45:01,070
<i>but he said he ran into some trouble
on his way to an Ordinal Scale battle.</i>

557
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:04,410
I see. Let me know when you find out more.

558
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:07,490
<i>Right. Be careful on that bike of yours, too.</i>

559
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:08,990
Agil

560
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:12,290
Daddy...

561
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,250
To: Seijirou Kikuoka Subject: It's Kirigaya. I have something to ask of you. There's something
bugging me about the recent OS event battles. I'm calling in the favors you owe me.

562
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:25,550
Do you think Yuna will show up again today?

563
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,850
What do you think of Yuna, Silica?

564
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:35,350
Is she a program like they announced,
or is she actually a real human?

565
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,610
I don’t think she's real.

566
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:42,190
But she doesn't seem like just an AI either.

567
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:47,490
I agree! That crystal-clear singing voice
isn't something a real human can produce--

568
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:50,620
Yeah, my voice isn't crystal-clear at all, is it now?

569
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:53,120
I didn't go that far!

570
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,040
I'm never going to karaoke with you again!

571
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:59,210
Sorry! Please forgive me!

572
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:00,630
It's almost time!

573
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,650
Are you guys ready?

574
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:24,820
All right, let the battle begin!
Music, start!

575
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,070
Yuna!

576
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,950
We lucked out!

577
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,870
All right, wanna go out there
and grab some points?

578
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:35,200
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

579
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,420
Just because there aren't any tanks!

580
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,380
Just as we planned!

581
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,680
This is a tough position to be in!

582
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,260
You three are kicking butt
even though you're all girls!

583
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,350
We're not gonna let you outdo us!

584
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:01,270
All right! Bring it on!

585
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,780
Ordinal Scale, activate!

586
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,070
Daddy?

587
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,080
That girl... she looks like someone.

588
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,960
You were in KoB.

589
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,590
You're Nautilus from
the Knights of the Blood Oath, right?

590
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:27,300
Please don’t call me by that name, Asuna.

591
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:30,550
Eiji?

592
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,970
You've spent a lot of time in this game, I see.

593
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,680
I'm not who I was before.

594
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:42,150
You seem to be a lot more mellow now yourself.

595
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,150
You really think so?

596
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,940
Yes. Back then, you were much...

597
00:47:58,910 --> 00:47:59,660
That girl...

598
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,210
Here goes!

599
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:05,750
It's about time.

600
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,270
Surround it!
We're all gonna attack at once!

601
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:30,820
What?

602
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,360
Something else is going to show up?

603
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:38,950
Pina!

604
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,040
Oh, is that all?

605
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,870
Pina, did you come to help us?

606
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:59,310
Silica! This way!

607
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:07,860
Daddy! That's the monster
called Dorcel the Chaos Drake,

608
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:10,320
who would've been the floor 91 boss!

609
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,820
Floor 91?

610
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,450
Dammit!

611
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,910
No!

612
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:21,580
Why are you going after me?

613
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:23,790
I'm sorry--

614
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:26,750
Silica!

615
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:29,550
Silica!

616
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:01,660
Asuna! Stay with me, Asuna!

617
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:05,960
Asuna!

618
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:08,750
Are you all right?

619
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,260
You bastard!

620
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,300
What the hell did you do?

621
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:28,560
How pitiful.

622
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:33,110
So that's all VR's greatest swordsman
amounts to in AR?

623
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,360
What did you say?

624
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,320
Hey, you!

625
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,490
Don't forget game etiquette!

626
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,220
Too bad!

627
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,850
Good job!

628
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:07,690
Hey! What about the bonus?

629
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:13,070
- Hey! I thought you were going to help Asuna!
- Bonus! Please kiss me!

630
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,030
Asuna! Are you okay?

631
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:28,580
That's too bad.
We'll have to wait for next time.

632
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:36,710
I-I'm sorry, Asuna.
It was all because I messed up.

633
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:41,340
You got shoved to the ground by that No. 2 guy!
What's his problem?

634
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:46,970
Yeah, but as expected of you,
vice commander of the Knights of the Blood Oath.

635
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:50,730
Wh-What's wrong, Asuna?

636
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:52,980
No! It's nothing!

637
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:54,860
Come on, let's go home.

638
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,440
- Okay.
- Will you be okay?

639
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:58,570
Here, grab onto me.

640
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,370
All right, see you. Good job tonight.

641
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,240
Kirito?

642
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:06,700
What's up?

643
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:12,120
Um... do you remember
the day that you and I first met?

644
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:17,170
Sure I do. It was at that boss raid meeting
on Aincrad's first floor.

645
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:22,550
It was, wasn't it?
You asked me to join your party, didn't you?

646
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,390
Looking back now, I can't believe
I was able to do something like that.

647
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:56,540
I can already see the lake from here.

648
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:58,300
I can't...

649
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:07,220
Kirito! Don't go off on your own!

650
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,310
Kirito?

651
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,130
Kirito!

652
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,010
Who are you?

653
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:44,170
I'm...

654
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:58,520
A dream?

655
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,480
Kirito?

656
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,330
Kirito...

657
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,460
No way... Why?

658
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:31,180
Hello?

659
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,100
What's wrong? It's late.

660
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,770
You didn't even turn on the lights.

661
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:47,150
Sorry, Kirito, for calling you here
all of a sudden.

662
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,820
It's okay. Anyway, did something happen?

663
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:02,420
About how long have we lived here, again?

664
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:07,670
If you mean since we first bought it in SAO,
it's been two and a half years.

665
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,680
It has, hasn't it?

666
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:10,970
Asuna?

667
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,680
Just as I thought, I can't remember.

668
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,940
What can't you remember?

669
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:21,980
I can't remember anything
that happened in Aincrad.

670
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:27,070
How you and I met, how we fought together,
and when we lived together in this house...

671
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:29,740
Wh-What are you talking about, Asuna?

672
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:31,030
You're kidding, aren't you?

673
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:37,330
As more time went by,
my memories of SAO kept fading.

674
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:39,500
And now there's nothing left.

675
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:50,260
Yokohama North General Hospital

676
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:02,770
I'll have to go through the data
before I'll know any details,

677
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:08,070
but Asuna's brain shows signs of having had
its memory scanned in specific areas.

678
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:10,240
Memory scanning in specific areas?

679
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:13,570
Do you mean that
it only read her memories of SAO?

680
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:15,030
But how is that possible?

681
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,910
One possibility that comes to mind,

682
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:20,910
is that as she's reliving memories
of her time in SAO,

683
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,420
the single neurons serving as
the key to those memories were identified,

684
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:29,970
and then the images could've been
forcibly scanned with focused electron pulses.

685
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:34,680
In the last few days, there have been
multiple reports of similar cases in the city.

686
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:38,970
It could be a coincidence,
but what the patients have in common

687
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:42,940
is the fact that they've taken part
in that AR game's event battles.

688
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:45,650
So are you saying that the Augma is the cause?

689
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:47,730
I can't be certain of that yet.

690
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,820
Is Asuna going to be all right?

691
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:55,620
At this time, there are no signs
of any organic anomalies in the brain itself.

692
00:56:55,700 --> 00:57:02,040
Most likely, her ability to recall was impaired
when the electron pulses degenerated her spine.

693
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:08,380
That said, I can't say without further observation
whether her symptoms will worsen.

694
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:13,930
In other words, she might lose even more
of her memory than she already has?

695
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,770
I'm sorry, Kirito.

696
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:33,030
Don't worry about it.
You still remember recent events, after all.

697
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:39,030
You've just temporarily forgotten
what happened in SAO.

698
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,950
It'll come back to you in no time.

699
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:50,380
Asuna?

700
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,300
What's wrong, Asuna?

701
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:58,720
Asuna!

702
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:37,970
Well?

703
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:46,100
I'm sorry, Kirito.
I can't remember anything, after all.

704
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:50,480
Even though I can remember
buying this house in ALO so clearly,

705
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,650
when it comes to SAO, there's nothing.

706
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,280
Mommy!

707
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:59,070
I'm sorry, Yui.
I know they're our precious memories.

708
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:03,790
I'm going to see if I can find out
what's going on in Ordinal Scale.

709
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:08,040
I'm sure I'll find a clue
that will help you regain your memories.

710
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:11,130
Thank you, Yui.

711
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:19,890
Even if I can't remember anything now,
it is true that I lived in this house with you, right?

712
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:20,890
Yes.

713
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:28,770
I'll go make us some tea.

714
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:30,270
I'll help out, too!

715
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:34,110
No. I'll do it. It'll be a nice change of pace.

716
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:31,250
I'm now more powerful
than Lightning Flash and the Black Swordsman.

717
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:33,080
Me, of all people!

718
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:36,920
Seriously, I owe it all to Ordinal Scale.

719
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:13,250
Soon, I can deliver what I promised to her.

720
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,420
Hello?

721
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:26,720
How's your injury?

722
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:30,100
Just the way it looks. Ouch!

723
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,730
Sorry to worry you.

724
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:36,350
Klein, has anything about you changed?

725
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:39,820
Do you remember what happened in SAO?

726
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:48,120
Well, when I try to remember,
it's like my head is in a haze.

727
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:52,830
Well, but it wasn't all fun times, right?

728
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:57,540
So I figure, if that's how it's gonna be, so be it.

729
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:11,260
<i>I can't wait to see the meteor shower!</i>

730
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,530
<i>Welcome to Augma!</i>

731
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:32,830
Subject: Warning about old SAD bosses It's possible your memory might be impaired if you fight the old SAO
bosses in OS. Two of my friends are suffering from it. Everyone, don't fight the old SAD bosses, it's dangerous!

732
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:34,910
002 That's impossible 003 No way 004 You're watching too many
sci-fi movies 005 You want the points for yourself that bad?

733
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,710
006 If that was true, it'd make the headlines 007 Come up with a better
lie... 008 lololol 009 Boring! I wonder where it'll appear today?

734
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:38,960
010 Yeah, point hogger 011 Maybe it'll appear at Minato
Ward's warehouses... 012 No, maybe around Roppongi Hills?

735
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,790
Dammit!

736
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:46,550
Search Ordinal Scale rankings!

737
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,360
Hey!

738
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,610
S-Sorry about that.

739
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:07,860
Let's go.

740
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:08,740
Yeah.

741
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:20,500
I can't tell if this was simply an accident,
or done intentionally.

742
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:25,340
But if it's the latter,
the same thing may continue to happen.

743
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:34,350
You mean, other SAO survivors playing Ordinal Scale
could lose their memories like Asuna?

744
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:39,690
<i>If I get taken out now,
I'll lose my memories, too.</i>

745
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:43,190
<i>If I lose my memories of those two years...</i>

746
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:46,190
<i>Can I be with Asuna like I always have?</i>

747
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:51,530
Daddy, I'm sorry!
I couldn't find the player named Eiji.

748
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:56,370
I couldn't get any information from just his name
and the visual data of his previous battle.

749
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:57,200
I see.

750
01:03:57,290 --> 01:03:58,870
Do your best, Daddy.

751
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:02,540
I'll be gathering data throughout this battle,
and find something to go on!

752
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:05,090
Right, I know you will.
I'm counting on you, Yui!

753
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:05,750
Right!

754
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,210
Someone's pretty pumped up, huh?

755
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:10,720
Sinon, why are you here?

756
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:14,260
You told everyone
it's too risky to fight the bosses,

757
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:16,100
but you’re doing it anyway.

758
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:19,140
But it really is dangerous.

759
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:22,350
If you get killed by the boss,
you'll be just like Asuna--

760
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,360
I'll be fine. After all, I'm not an SAO survivor.

761
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:30,900
As long as I don’t have any memories to scan,
nothing can happen to me. Right, Yui?

762
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,070
Yes, I assume so.

763
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,080
But there's no proof--

764
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:38,660
If you’re that worried,
then make sure you protect me, all right?

765
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:41,830
Daddy, please look out for Sinon!

766
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,920
- Ordinal Scale, activate!
- Ordinal Scale, activate!

767
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:02,230
That's...

768
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:07,480
The floor 18 boss, Dire Tusk?
Wasn't today the floor 13 boss?

769
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:12,450
Currently, ten monsters are appearing
in multiple locations across the city!

770
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:14,280
That's what I call splurging.

771
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:18,200
In addition,
the bosses' locations are being shuffled!

772
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:23,870
- That really is the Dire Tusk.
- All right.

773
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:37,430
It's going to switch
to long-distance mode in a second.

774
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,720
We'll play it by the book, all right?

775
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,060
What does it think it's doing?

776
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:47,190
Get away!

777
01:05:58,580 --> 01:05:59,580
On, crap!

778
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:21,720
- That's it!
- Go! Go!

779
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:31,940
You're attacking too much!

780
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:03,560
You bastard!

781
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:18,450
So he wasn't here today, huh?

782
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:19,660
Impressive!

783
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:21,370
My bad. You saved me.

784
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:23,580
You can pay me back with cake in Ginza, okay?

785
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:26,080
Will you let me off the hook
if I give you my beef bowl coupon?

786
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,120
I don’t want that!

787
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:30,580
All right, then at least
give me a ride home on your bike.

788
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:33,380
Yuna?

789
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,340
Please wait!

790
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:40,930
Who are you?

791
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:50,940
I'm sorry, Daddy.
I was this close, but I got blocked.

792
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:54,770
Although I was able to confirm
that a mysterious program would activate

793
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:58,530
only when specific players
were damaged by the boss.

794
01:07:58,610 --> 01:07:59,610
Is that so?

795
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:00,450
Dammit!

796
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:03,910
Want something to drink?

797
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:18,170
<i>Search...</i>

798
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:19,800
That's right.

799
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:24,010
Yui, do you remember which direction
the girl in the hoodie was pointing?

800
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:25,810
Yes. Why do you ask?

801
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:28,560
I want you to plot it over a map of Tokyo.

802
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,980
00-okayama in Setagaya Ward?

803
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:39,650
Yui, what's here?

804
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:43,570
Daddy, this is where
the Toto Institute of Technology is located.

805
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:45,660
So this is where I'm supposed to go?

806
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:50,830
I'm going to cross-reference Toto Institute
and Eiji's player data and run a search!

807
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:55,420
This person...

808
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:59,670
It's the Augma's designer,
Professor Tetsuhiro Shigemura!

809
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:03,640
The Augma...

810
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:07,140
Toto Institute of Technology

811
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:13,940
The most glaring flaw in the full-dive VR device
would be the full-dive function itself.

812
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:21,780
The risks of cutting off all of one's physical senses
in order to play a VB game are incalculable.

813
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:26,240
Needless to say, applications
for full-dive technology aren't limited to games.

814
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:30,080
Communication, browsing, digital production...

815
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:36,960
But in truth, these can be done with sight,
hearing, and limited tactile information.

816
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,550
So, rather than a dangerous full-dive device,

817
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:44,510
one should be able to choose
a safe AR device instead.

818
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:48,760
Does anyone have any questions so far?

819
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:53,600
All right, you there.

820
01:09:54,810 --> 01:09:59,900
I believe that AR machines come with dangers
that don’t exist in full-dive machines.

821
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:01,820
What are your thoughts on that?

822
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:06,660
Do you mean something like traffic accidents
while wearing such devices?

823
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:09,740
No. I mean that the information
added by the machine

824
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:13,250
could potentially invade
the user's perception of reality.

825
01:10:13,330 --> 01:10:16,750
Full-dive technology
transforms a virtual world into reality.

826
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:20,420
But doesn't AR technology
make the real world virtual?

827
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:27,760
I'll answer that question next time.
That's it for today.

828
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:30,220
I'll get to the point.

829
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:34,680
Do you know someone named Eiji,
who's ranked No. 2 in Ordinal Scale?

830
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:36,270
I'm not sure.

831
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:38,810
Wasn't he in your lab?

832
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:41,270
I have a lot of students, you know.

833
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:47,320
Then, are you aware that SAO survivors
are suffering memory loss due to the Augma?

834
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:50,370
Doesn't the Augma
have a hidden function

835
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:53,830
that scans the user's memories
while the device is worn?

836
01:10:55,540 --> 01:11:00,540
Kikuoka of the Ministry told me
you just wanted to audit my seminar.

837
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:05,590
The Augma having an irregular function equipped
will be uncovered right away under scrutiny.

838
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:10,390
And if that fact is revealed,
the Augma will be shelved like the NerveGear.

839
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:14,720
Do you really want to follow the same path
as your student, Akihiko Kayaba?

840
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:17,890
What are you talking about?

841
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:21,770
Even if such memory scanning
or whatever you call it were possible,

842
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:26,320
why would it be a problem
for them to lose their memories of SAO?

843
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:30,030
There's a saying, "Blessed are the forgetful,
for they get the better even of their blunders."

844
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:35,620
Don’t you think that those survivors
want to forget their terrifying past?

845
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:39,170
Next time, get yourself an official appointment.

846
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:43,250
Of course, that doesn't mean
my schedule will be open for you.

847
01:11:51,550 --> 01:11:54,220
Professor, you build robots, too?

848
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:56,890
Excuse me.

849
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:08,190
<i>That's right,
Prof. Shigemura does have a daughter.</i>

850
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:12,030
<i>Actually, he had one.
But she passed away two years ago.</i>

851
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:22,880
Yuuna Shigemura

852
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:14,180
Yuuna?

853
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:17,000
I'm sure you've already made the connection,

854
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,180
but his daughter's death
was caused by the NerveGear

855
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:22,880
She was a victim of the SAO Incident.

856
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:27,460
What does this mean? What is he trying to do?

857
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:32,260
<i>Like the professor said, maybe it's meant
as counseling for the SAO survivors.</i>

858
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:37,810
At any rate, it's highly possible that
the Augma's equipped with a dangerous function.

859
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:41,770
Mr. Kikuoka, can't you use your authority
to shut down the service?

860
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:42,440
Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications

861
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:47,900
but we're up against a colossal project linked to
the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.

862
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:50,700
I can't act unless we find solid evidence.

863
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:52,780
It's going to take some time.

864
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:56,160
<i>There are a lot of SAO survivors
among the Ordinal Scale players.</i>

865
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:59,410
If they happen to fight the bosses
from Old Aincrad,

866
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,870
there's going to be more and more cases
of memory loss.

867
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:04,250
<i>I'll do the best that I can.</i>

868
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:09,380
<i>Klein and his friends in the hospital
all seemed to have the same symptoms.</i>

869
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:12,680
<i>Although their external injuries
were more troubling than their memories.</i>

870
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:16,510
<i>Kirito, if possible,
try not to fight any more bosses.</i>

871
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,680
<i>If you lose your memory as well,
that will be troublesome.</i>

872
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:34,280
Asuna Yuuki

873
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:38,280
What's up?

874
01:13:38,990 --> 01:13:41,790
<i>Well, I just wanted to hear your voice.</i>

875
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:42,910
Is that right?

876
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:48,040
Listen, Asuna.
Do you think I could see you now?

877
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:51,340
Oh, uh, if it's not a good time, that's okay.

878
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:56,140
<i>No, it's fine.
I'm just a little scared to go outside.</i>

879
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:59,310
Gotcha. Then I'll head over to your place.

880
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:02,810
I'm in 00-okayama right now,
so I'm about 20 minutes away.

881
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:06,270
P-Pardon the intrusion!

882
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:10,480
You don't have to be that formal.
It's fine! Nobody's home right now.

883
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:13,690
Y-Yeah, but... It's my first time--

884
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:16,410
Do you think I should've brought a gift?

885
01:14:16,490 --> 01:14:18,820
That's not necessary! Sheesh.

886
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:20,240
Come on, this way.

887
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:28,170
Someone told me that all survivors
want to forget their terrifying pasts.

888
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:31,210
In a way, that might be true.

889
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:36,010
Yes, a lot of terrifying and sad things happened.

890
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:43,100
But those two years we spent in SAO
are precious memories that define who we are now.

891
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:51,270
So this is the "future room" I've heard about.

892
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:56,280
But its atmosphere reminds me
of your room back in Selmburg.

893
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,990
I'll go get us something to drink, okay?

894
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,080
Sure.

895
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,580
Make yourself at home.

896
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:34,110
<i>To the me of tomorrow.</i>

897
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:37,450
<i>I haven 't been writing in this diary lately,</i>

898
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:41,660
<i>but as I might forget what's happened
since I've returned to the real world, too,</i>

899
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:43,950
<i>I'm going to write down
howl feel right now.</i>

900
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:49,040
<i>It's already been four years
since I met Kirito, hasn't it?</i>

901
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:54,550
<i>All of my memories with Kirito
are sparkling like jewels.</i>

902
01:15:55,500 --> 01:16:01,340
<i>Even if I end up losing more and more
of my memories because of Ordinal Scale,</i>

903
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:06,390
<i>if I can keep accumulating new memories with him,
I think I should be fine.</i>

904
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:13,360
<i>According to my calendar, I'm to go with Kirito
to the mountains in Saitama to see the stars soon,</i>

905
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:17,530
<i>but I've completely lost the memory
of the day we made that promise.</i>

906
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:25,240
<i>I've re-read this diary, and it seems like
Kirito is going to give me some kind of present,</i>

907
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:28,500
<i>but I wonder if he 'II forgive me
for forgetting our promise.</i>

908
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:34,210
<i>I want to give him something in return,
but since I'm not allowed to work part-time,</i>

909
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:37,840
<i>I 'd like to use the points and pocket money
I've saved up on a gift for him.</i>

910
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:41,720
<i>My beloved Kirito.</i>

911
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:47,260
<i>If I ever forget even Kirito...
If I ever lose these feelings...</i>

912
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:51,060
<i>If I end up not being able
to make new memories...</i>

913
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:54,360
<i>Thinking about that really scares me.</i>

914
01:16:55,770 --> 01:17:00,610
<i>I pray that the me of tomorrow
won't have lost what I'm feeling right now.</i>

915
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:10,450
It's all right.
I don’t mind you reading it, Kirito.

916
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,180
Asuna. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

917
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:35,900
I love you, Kirito. I love you so much!

918
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:40,610
Even if I lose all my memories of SAO,

919
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:43,700
this feeling is the one thing
that will never, ever change.

920
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:51,700
Me, too, Asuna. I love you.
I always have, and I always will.

921
01:18:04,510 --> 01:18:07,180
I'm going to get your memories back
no matter what.

922
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:10,350
So I want you to trust me, Asuna.

923
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:17,310
A shooting star!

924
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:20,440
Hey, Eiji, tomorrow's the day.

925
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:24,400
The day when my dream of singing
in a gigantic venue comes true!

926
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:26,490
Right. Are you nervous?

927
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:28,120
Nope, not at all.

928
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:31,950
After all, I get to sing before a huge crowd!
I've got to enjoy myself.

929
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:35,540
And that's where I'm going to
become the No. 1 diva, right?

930
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:40,000
That's right. You're going to
become this world's No. 1, once and for all.

931
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:42,460
Hey, read to me from that book again, Eiji.

932
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:44,970
All right. Sure.

933
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:48,180
So where do you show up in this book, Eiji?

934
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:49,930
That's what I'd like to hear.

935
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:52,100
I'm not in it.

936
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:54,520
I don’t appear in this book.

937
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:59,020
Those of us who couldn't fight
aren't worth remembering.

938
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:01,270
YES?

939
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:03,820
Jeez!

940
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:07,150
<i>You're certainly taking your time
getting this job done.</i>

941
01:19:07,490 --> 01:19:10,320
<i>Someone's caught on to our plan.
You need to hurry.</i>

942
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:12,080
Yes, sir. I understand.

943
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:15,870
<i>I've already set up the road map
to the final phase.</i>

944
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:18,790
<i>You'll keep your promise, won't you?</i>

945
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,460
Of course I will. How could I ever forget?

946
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,050
<i>I'm counting an you, sir.</i>

947
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:25,010
<i>By the way, about Yuna,</i>

948
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:29,510
from time to time, her actions indicate
she has interests other than singing.

949
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:32,010
<i>That's probably due to
her self-preservation program.</i>

950
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:35,140
<i>Just think of it as a sign
that the plan is proceeding.</i>

951
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:37,350
Understood.

952
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:00,830
Treasures of Meiji Shrine

953
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:57,890
Yuuna, right?

954
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:03,400
Where is this place? Is it a dream, or...

955
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,860
Dreams and virtual worlds
are more or less the same thing.

956
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:10,900
Once you wake up,
everything becomes an ephemeral memory.

957
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:11,990
Memory...

958
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:14,950
It could be that it was all just a dream.

959
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:19,160
You clearing that death game,
and coming back to the real world.

960
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:23,080
When you open your eyes,
you might still be trapped inside Aincrad.

961
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,290
Hasn't that thought crossed your mind?

962
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,010
Sure it has,
but it's not something I've ever wanted.

963
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:33,510
I see. So you were in SAO, after all.

964
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:36,680
Are you Prof. Shigemura's daughter?

965
01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:38,310
So you’re alive?

966
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:43,060
Why did you send me to see the professor,
and what did you want me to do?

967
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,610
Why did the professor
steal Asuna's memories of SAO?

968
01:21:46,730 --> 01:21:48,690
What exactly is the Augma?

969
01:21:52,690 --> 01:21:57,280
<i>O, stars that illuminate the sky...</i>

970
01:21:57,410 --> 01:22:02,660
<i>Soft breeze drifting o’er the hills...</i>

971
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:07,380
<i>Please grant thine blessings to
those travelers who</i>

972
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:13,380
<i>- are passing lnraugn the ancient oily.</i>
- This <i>song</i> is...

973
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:19,760
All I want is to go on singing.
That's what I wish for.

974
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:23,560
What am I supposed to do?
What can I do to save Asuna?

975
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:27,020
If you want to get Asuna's memories back,

976
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:30,730
your current ranking number
isn't nearly high enough.

977
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:33,780
Now, then, it's almost time. Wake up.

978
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,410
H-Hey, are you okay?

979
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:40,080
Y-Yeah.

980
01:22:40,410 --> 01:22:43,000
Were you playing that Augma game?

981
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:45,960
I hear it's all the rage these days,
but you better be careful.

982
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,920
Try not to fall on your face, okay?

983
01:22:58,510 --> 01:23:01,010
Karaoke Palace

984
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:07,520
So anyway, it seems like Silica's feeling
a little responsible, too.

985
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:11,570
<i>I had no idea.
If only I could've been in the battles.</i>

986
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:15,780
Klein got himself hurt
and ended up in the hospital,

987
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:17,860
so it might be a good thing
you couldn't make it.

988
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:21,580
Kirito told the other players
not to fight the bosses,

989
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:24,910
but then he fought by himself
in an Ordinal Scale battle.

990
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,040
Although I did kind of help him.

991
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:34,550
<i>Th-Then, I 'II teach him some kendo moves
he can use in that game's battles!</i>

992
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:37,970
Such beautiful sibling love.

993
01:23:38,050 --> 01:23:40,640
Liz, we're going to sing together next!

994
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:43,470
Since the concert's tomorrow,
we've got to study up!

995
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,180
Now, please take this mic!

996
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:50,600
Is this their way of cheering her up?

997
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:55,280
<i>Well, Asuna does look like
she's enjoying herself.?</i>

998
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:57,820
So I guess it's okay?

999
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:06,750
H-Hey, what's wrong?

1000
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:07,700
Are you okay?

1001
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:17,300
Just like yesterday,

1002
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:21,550
the bosses from floors 20 to 30
are appearing throughout the city!

1003
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,680
I'm taking the shortest route
to take them all out!

1004
01:24:36,150 --> 01:24:39,700
That guy's pretty much
inflicting all the damage himself.

1005
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:41,030
Awesome.

1006
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:47,950
Wh-What the hell?

1007
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:51,870
Don’t get so worked up over a game.
It's just for fun, right?

1008
01:24:55,210 --> 01:24:56,040
Move!

1009
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:08,720
All right, time for a special stage.
Give it your all, you guys!

1010
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,560
Lucky us!

1011
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,470
Congratulations!

1012
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:56,360
I see you've finally learned how
to fight in this game, Mr. Black Swordsman.

1013
01:25:56,810 --> 01:25:58,360
You!

1014
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,030
A message from "E" has arrived.

1015
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:09,740
Come to Yuna's concert.
I'll return Lightning Flash's memories there.

1016
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:45,360
Today is finally here!! Yuna's Live!
@ the New National Stadium Arena

1017
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:01,500
Wow, Yuna's popularity is mind-blowing.

1018
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,050
My throat's sore from singing too much.

1019
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:06,340
You got yourself way too fired up.

1020
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:08,680
Silica, thank you for yesterday!

1021
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,260
D-Don’t mention it!

1022
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:13,470
Still, it's too bad for those guys, huh?

1023
01:27:13,890 --> 01:27:15,270
Huh? Where's Kirito?

1024
01:27:15,390 --> 01:27:18,190
He said he had to go to the bathroom.

1025
01:27:27,530 --> 01:27:29,030
I'm here, as promised.

1026
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:34,950
You're giving Asuna's memories back,
even if I have to force you.

1027
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:38,000
Please don’t rush me, Mr. Black Swordsman.

1028
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:40,380
And you’re Nautilus, right?

1029
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:43,670
The one who couldn't confront his fear of death
and refused to fight?

1030
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:44,960
I'm Eiji now!

1031
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:49,550
That's ancient history.

1032
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:53,310
I'm surprised you even knew about me.

1033
01:27:53,470 --> 01:27:56,430
I know someone who does. They told me.

1034
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:02,400
Seducing Lightning Flash wasn't enough,
so now you're going after Yuna?

1035
01:28:02,730 --> 01:28:04,320
What are you talking about?

1036
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:07,900
Oh, never mind.
You've come here so casually,

1037
01:28:07,990 --> 01:28:11,070
but do you really think you can beat me,
the No. 2 ranked player?

1038
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:15,290
How will I know unless I try?
It's not like you’re No. 1.

1039
01:28:21,790 --> 01:28:23,790
- Ordinal Scale, activate!
- Ordinal Scale, activate!

1040
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:13,390
I admit I took advantage of my position

1041
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:18,720
as external board director of Argus
to give Yuuna a NerveGear and SAO.

1042
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:22,060
I just wanted to look good
in my daughter's eyes.

1043
01:29:22,850 --> 01:29:26,480
But my stupidity is what killed her.

1044
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:28,440
Yuuna!

1045
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:40,620
Just as expected of the one
who guided players to clear SAO.

1046
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:44,000
Is that all No. 2 can do?
It doesn’t amount to much!

1047
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:53,260
In the end, people only remember the players
who fought on the front lines.

1048
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:56,340
Weaklings like Yuuna and me
are always overlooked!

1049
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:59,010
You were with Yuuna in SAO?

1050
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:00,020
Yeah, I was!

1051
01:30:02,020 --> 01:30:05,020
I was with her
at the moment she disappeared, too!

1052
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,360
You've no idea how I cursed my weakness!

1053
01:30:07,690 --> 01:30:11,480
Even when someone precious to me was in danger,
I couldn't even move an inch!

1054
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:19,450
Yuuna's brain was so damaged by the NerveGear,
it was impossible to save or repair it.

1055
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:23,620
But if I can acquire memories of Yuuna
from the other SAO players

1056
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:26,790
and combine those fragments,
I can use Deep Learning

1057
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:33,170
to resurrect Yuuna as an AI.

1058
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:50,520
The numbers in the Ordinal System are absolute.
The one given No. 1 becomes immortal.

1059
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:54,030
It was you who designed it that way,
wasn't it, Kayaba?

1060
01:30:56,200 --> 01:31:00,660
Therefore, she's "una." Latin for "one," then?

1061
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:05,710
In contrast to the Cardinal System,
which controlled Aincrad using cardinal numbers,

1062
01:31:05,790 --> 01:31:08,920
the Ordinal System controls
using ordinal numbers.

1063
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:14,550
You discovered the system I'd discarded
during the early development stage of SAO,

1064
01:31:14,630 --> 01:31:17,380
and resurrected it into a new game.

1065
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:22,220
True, the man I was before
might have done the same.

1066
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:26,810
But you see, Professor,
the man I am now believes...

1067
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:30,940
in the existence of a power
that transcends the system itself.

1068
01:31:34,650 --> 01:31:39,990
Who cares if we take away memories
of that crap game, SAD?

1069
01:31:40,990 --> 01:31:44,290
Is this the secret behind your power?

1070
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:49,290
Dammit!

1071
01:31:58,970 --> 01:32:04,720
I can't lose to someone who denies his past self
just because he suffered once.

1072
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:10,810
All right, tell me how
to get Asuna's memories back!

1073
01:32:34,670 --> 01:32:37,340
- What's going on?
- Come on! Is that all?

1074
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:50,020
That was fun!

1075
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,220
It's too late now.

1076
01:33:22,970 --> 01:33:25,890
Almost all of the SAO survivors are here.

1077
01:33:26,890 --> 01:33:32,310
We're going to scan the brains
of every SAO survivor in this venue,

1078
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:34,350
and take their memories of SAO.

1079
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:37,150
And then we're going to bring Yuuna back to life.

1080
01:33:37,230 --> 01:33:39,480
What are you talking about?

1081
01:33:39,570 --> 01:33:41,820
All right, it's started.

1082
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:43,990
There's no stopping it now.

1083
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:55,250
<i>This is what I learned from Kamura,
the manufacturer of the Augma.</i>

1084
01:33:55,460 --> 01:34:00,590
<i>Right now, the drones flying inside the stadium
are equipped with a wireless power feed function</i>

1085
01:34:00,670 --> 01:34:03,680
<i>that can boost the output
of the Augmas themselves.</i>

1086
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:05,090
What does that mean?

1087
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:08,350
<i>If they run that scan inside the stadium,</i>

1088
01:34:08,390 --> 01:34:12,020
<i>it might not just be partial memory loss
we 're looking at.</i>

1089
01:34:12,770 --> 01:34:14,020
You mean that...

1090
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:15,100
<i>That's right.</i>

1091
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:20,610
<i>Like the NerveGear, the scan could
damage the brain, and even lead to death.</i>

1092
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:31,120
<i>I'll stop the professor.</i>

1093
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:35,120
<i>Kirito, tell the audience in that stadium
to take off their Augmas.</i>

1094
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:40,800
What the hell is this?

1095
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,300
What's going on?

1096
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:46,180
- Let us out!
- What's going on?

1097
01:34:59,810 --> 01:35:00,770
Asuna!

1098
01:35:05,990 --> 01:35:07,990
Asuna! Sorry I'm late.

1099
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:11,240
Kirito!

1100
01:35:12,490 --> 01:35:16,250
Looks like we're going to have to
leave the venue entirely to Kirito.

1101
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:17,620
Let's hurry!

1102
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:24,300
Yuuna?

1103
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,720
Dad, I want you to stop this now.

1104
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:30,510
No, you’re not Yuuna yet.

1105
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:33,470
I don’t want to come back to life.

1106
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:40,060
You're still at the level of AI where your
self-preservation program is making you say this.

1107
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:42,610
It won't be long now, so just wait patiently.

1108
01:35:42,690 --> 01:35:43,940
Dad...

1109
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:47,610
I'm having an AI-type crawler gather the data.

1110
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:49,950
She's just finishing up.

1111
01:35:50,410 --> 01:35:53,790
It's her final task.
She really did a fine job.

1112
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:55,450
Don’t do it, Dad!

1113
01:35:55,580 --> 01:35:58,120
If you run a high-output scan inside,

1114
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:00,790
the resonance effect might not
just take their memories, but kill them!

1115
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,290
You be quiet, Yuuna!

1116
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:19,190
<i>Catastrophe in popular VB game
10,000 people trapped in the game</i>

1117
01:36:19,310 --> 01:36:24,150
If I can bring you back to life,
I'll gladly sell my soul to the devil!

1118
01:36:25,230 --> 01:36:31,910
Even if... even if it means
following the same path as that man.

1119
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:34,870
All I want is to get that moment back.

1120
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:49,260
Give me that!

1121
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:00,940
So he's not making it easy for us, huh?

1122
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:04,270
Find out where that camera's connected.

1123
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:10,110
I guess we're even now, Kikuoka.

1124
01:37:14,780 --> 01:37:18,080
I'm sorry. I lost to one of the players.

1125
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:20,910
But now all that's left to do
is the simultaneous scan.

1126
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:24,580
We can finally bring back Yuna... Yuuna...

1127
01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:27,460
<i>You still have a final task, don't you?</i>

1128
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:28,460
What?

1129
01:37:28,550 --> 01:37:31,970
<i>I want you to supply me
with your memories of her as well.</i>

1130
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:37,310
<i>Eiji. You were with Yuuna the longest
in SAO, weren't you?</i>

1131
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:38,930
<i>What else did you expect?</i>

1132
01:37:39,970 --> 01:37:43,980
<i>I have no use for someone
who couldn't even master the equipment I provided.!</i>

1133
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:45,400
No way.

1134
01:37:45,650 --> 01:37:49,900
But you said that you'd make sure
I could be with Yuuna forever!

1135
01:37:50,110 --> 01:37:51,190
<i>Farewell.</i>

1136
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,710
- Yuuna?
- Kirito, give me a hand!

1137
01:38:12,170 --> 01:38:15,090
At this rate, everyone here will be in danger!

1138
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:18,350
When the average of
all of their emotive counters goes over 10,000,

1139
01:38:18,430 --> 01:38:21,850
a high-output scan will begin,
inflicting damage on their brains!

1140
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:23,100
R-Right!

1141
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:23,980
Everybody!

1142
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:26,270
Take off your Augmas right now!

1143
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:28,190
Take them off or you'll be in danger!

1144
01:38:29,610 --> 01:38:30,610
It's no use.

1145
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:33,780
The reason he made the boss monsters appear
in all the previous events

1146
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:35,910
was to make sure everyone
would fight them here!

1147
01:38:35,950 --> 01:38:37,200
Then what should I do?

1148
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:39,120
The place where we met yesterday...

1149
01:38:39,450 --> 01:38:43,450
That was floor 100 in Old Aincrad.
Defeat its boss monster, Black Swordsman!

1150
01:38:44,370 --> 01:38:45,830
If you do that, I'm sure...

1151
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:50,040
I'll unlock the Augma's full-dive function now,
so sit in that chair!

1152
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:52,050
The Augma has a full-dive function?

1153
01:38:52,340 --> 01:38:55,550
The Augma is just a version
of the NerveGear with limited functions.

1154
01:38:55,630 --> 01:38:56,800
Now hurry!

1155
01:38:59,470 --> 01:39:00,390
Got it!

1156
01:39:01,930 --> 01:39:02,930
You guys...

1157
01:39:07,190 --> 01:39:08,230
- Let's do this.
- Right!

1158
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:09,440
Daddy, good luck!

1159
01:39:09,730 --> 01:39:11,320
Yui, take care of Asuna!

1160
01:39:12,230 --> 01:39:13,190
Kirito...

1161
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:17,240
It's all right. I'll be back in no time.
I'm going to save everyone else here, too.

1162
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:19,410
Trust me, and wait for me, Asuna.

1163
01:39:21,990 --> 01:39:22,950
Kirito!

1164
01:39:23,450 --> 01:39:25,410
When I get back, let's keep our promise.

1165
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:31,250
Link start!

1166
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:43,930
So this is floor 100 of Aincrad, the Ruby Palace.

1167
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:47,640
Who knew we'd be seeing this place
after two years.

1168
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:01,370
“An!

1169
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:08,960
So this is SAO's true last boss?

1170
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:10,500
Let's go!

1171
01:40:33,690 --> 01:40:34,360
Switch!

1172
01:40:36,070 --> 01:40:37,150
Switch!

1173
01:40:54,630 --> 01:40:55,670
Damn!

1174
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:57,000
No way!

1175
01:40:57,090 --> 01:40:59,630
We have no chance of beating that thing!

1176
01:41:18,650 --> 01:41:20,190
I'm sorry, Asuna.

1177
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:28,040
Your memory was scanned to extract information
about me, a player who died in Aincrad.

1178
01:41:28,870 --> 01:41:34,670
My father is inflicting the terror of being killed
by a boss monster onto every SAO survivor,

1179
01:41:34,750 --> 01:41:37,590
to run a simultaneous high-output scan
on their memories.

1180
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:42,590
If that happens, it might leave your brains
with irreparable damage.

1181
01:41:42,630 --> 01:41:44,140
It might even kill them.

1182
01:41:44,180 --> 01:41:45,850
N-No way!

1183
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:48,220
Mommy!

1184
01:41:50,220 --> 01:41:52,980
<i>If I remove this, Kirito will be saved.</i>

1185
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:57,020
<i>But then Kirito won't he able
to save the people he's trying to save.</i>

1186
01:42:06,870 --> 01:42:07,700
Yuna?

1187
01:42:08,410 --> 01:42:13,160
If you lost your life in SAO,
it was because you left the safe zone.

1188
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:16,750
It was because you fought a monster
and tried to clear the floor!

1189
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:18,960
I'm going to fight again.

1190
01:42:19,630 --> 01:42:22,420
Yui, I'm going to join Kirito.

1191
01:42:22,510 --> 01:42:24,630
All right, Mommy.
I'll catch up as soon as I can.

1192
01:42:29,010 --> 01:42:30,470
Link start!

1193
01:42:32,850 --> 01:42:33,430
Stop it!

1194
01:42:37,190 --> 01:42:37,940
Silica!

1195
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:41,820
Kirito!

1196
01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:42,990
Silica!

1197
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:45,110
No!

1198
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:46,280
Run!

1199
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:48,160
Dammit!

1200
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:02,630
Asuna?

1201
01:43:02,710 --> 01:43:04,090
Silica!

1202
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:07,180
I'm sorry, it's all my fault!

1203
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:08,970
You were feeling guilty all this time.

1204
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:11,100
I'm sorry, Silica.

1205
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:13,930
Asuna!

1206
01:43:18,810 --> 01:43:20,860
Sorry I'm late, you guys!

1207
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:22,650
Are you all right?

1208
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:26,990
I'm going to fight, too. I can fight, Kirito.

1209
01:43:27,570 --> 01:43:28,660
Right.

1210
01:43:44,670 --> 01:43:47,170
Big Brother! Sorry to make you wait!

1211
01:43:48,510 --> 01:43:51,010
Daddy! Mommy! I brought everyone!

1212
01:43:54,010 --> 01:43:56,310
- Looks like fun!
- We're not hereto have fun!

1213
01:43:56,680 --> 01:43:59,520
All right! We're invincible in VB!

1214
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:08,990
That thing is huge!

1215
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:10,700
Those guys...

1216
01:44:11,070 --> 01:44:12,160
Time is running out!

1217
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:13,490
Bombard that thing!

1218
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:16,370
It's all right! Please use this!

1219
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:25,460
This is...

1220
01:44:26,050 --> 01:44:26,880
Pina!

1221
01:44:29,050 --> 01:44:34,220
I've loaded the saved data
left on the SAO server onto you all.

1222
01:44:34,390 --> 01:44:36,180
Sinon, yours is a special bonus!

1223
01:44:40,390 --> 01:44:42,520
All right, you guys, let's go!

1224
01:45:21,730 --> 01:45:22,560
Block that!

1225
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:26,860
Let's go, Asuna!

1226
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:27,400
Right!

1227
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:33,570
Missed!

1228
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:39,040
Switch!

1229
01:45:39,450 --> 01:45:40,960
<i>This is what I can do now...</i>

1230
01:46:15,820 --> 01:46:18,160
- We did it!
- Yay!

1231
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:37,510
<i>Now you’ve cleared it completely, eh, Kirito?</i>

1232
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:38,640
Kayaba?

1233
01:46:38,930 --> 01:46:42,100
<i>But isn't there something
you still need to do?</i>

1234
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:46,910
It's Yuna!

1235
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:05,180
Why... Why?

1236
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:08,940
I was so close. Yuuna!

1237
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:18,070
Thank you, Dad.

1238
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:21,160
I'm here in your memories.

1239
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:22,700
Forever...

1240
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:06,910
That was a great performance, Yuuna.

1241
01:49:07,370 --> 01:49:08,450
Thank you.

1242
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:16,840
The data for my main body was partially based
on the Aincrad floor 100 boss's resource script.

1243
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:20,340
Its language engine is what enabled me to move.

1244
01:49:20,590 --> 01:49:23,970
But the boss has been defeated,
and its saved data will be reset.

1245
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:27,470
- So I have to say goodbye to you all.
- No way!

1246
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:29,350
I really enjoyed myself.

1247
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:32,640
My dream of singing
before a huge crowd was realized,

1248
01:49:32,770 --> 01:49:34,860
so I couldn't be happier.

1249
01:49:35,980 --> 01:49:38,190
I'm going to return something
I borrowed from you.

1250
01:49:38,860 --> 01:49:41,950
The fear of death
caused your memory impairment.

1251
01:49:42,490 --> 01:49:47,910
But you overcame that and fought.
So I'm sure it'll all come back to you.

1252
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:06,390
<i>You remembered my dream.</i>

1253
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:48,660
"Ordinal Scale"
Accident at the event?

1254
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:52,270
<i>An incident was reported at
the live concert of AR idol Yuna at the New National Stadium Arena.</i>

1255
01:50:52,270 --> 01:50:55,500
It's said several monsters from Ordinal Scale
appeared in the venue.

1256
01:50:55,540 --> 01:50:59,520
But it was actually a surprise stage,
according to its promoter's announcement.

1257
01:51:00,230 --> 01:51:04,860
<i>Next story. Kamura Inc., the company
that operates the Augma, has announced</i>

1258
01:51:04,990 --> 01:51:10,530
<i>The resignation of its head of development,
Toto Institute of Technology's Prof. Shigemura.</i>

1259
01:51:14,410 --> 01:51:16,040
Congratulations on being discharged!

1260
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:17,540
Are you sure you’re all right?

1261
01:51:17,580 --> 01:51:20,040
Oh, man, that was an ordeal.

1262
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:22,460
I'd rather do VR for games after all.

1263
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:24,880
But isn't there more chance
of meeting girls through AR?

1264
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:29,180
It's no big deal! Games aren't for meeting girls.

1265
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:34,390
Is that a crack about me and my wife?
And you wasted the ticket I gave you!

1266
01:51:34,470 --> 01:51:37,520
- What? Ow! What the hell!
- You got a problem?

1267
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:39,770
Hey, now. Here are some souvenirs!

1268
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:41,860
Come to think of it, where did you go again?

1269
01:51:42,020 --> 01:51:45,570
Romantic Connections Marshmallow Shimane.
There weren't any computers at our lodgings,

1270
01:51:49,820 --> 01:51:52,370
By the way, where are Kirito and Asuna?

1271
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:55,580
They said they had somewhere to go.
Have you heard anything?

1272
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:59,540
Well, now, it's all good.
Just forget about them.

1273
01:51:59,580 --> 01:52:00,960
What the hell?

1274
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:05,260
Not showing up to celebrate his best friend
in SAO being discharged? What a jerk!

1275
01:52:05,340 --> 01:52:09,640
I think I'm going to charge just you today.
To reimburse me for that ticket.

1276
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:13,010
What? I thought it was free!
You greedy merchant!

1277
01:52:13,390 --> 01:52:15,020
Oh, man...

1278
01:52:15,180 --> 01:52:19,350
I wonder if I'll meet any cute girls on a quest
now that ALO's reopened?

1279
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:20,770
Not a chance!

1280
01:52:20,850 --> 01:52:23,270
Mt. Doudaira

1281
01:52:23,650 --> 01:52:25,650
It really gets pitch dark, huh?

1282
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:27,860
Yeah. Can you see, Yui?

1283
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:30,780
<i>Yes, Daddy. I can see just fine!</i>

1284
01:52:30,860 --> 01:52:33,700
<i>Though it is a little greenish overall.</i>

1285
01:52:34,700 --> 01:52:37,790
I never thought the three of us
would really make it here.

1286
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:40,460
In the end, I left the house
without telling my mom.

1287
01:52:41,580 --> 01:52:43,420
A-Are you sure that's okay?

1288
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:50,380
When we get back, I'll go meet her.

1289
01:52:54,810 --> 01:52:58,890
Asuna, do you remember?
What we promised each other in Aincrad?

1290
01:52:59,140 --> 01:53:00,770
To go see the stars?

1291
01:53:00,810 --> 01:53:03,520
Yeah. Well, that's part of it, but...

1292
01:53:03,810 --> 01:53:08,860
Just kidding. I remember.
That you said you'd give me a present.

1293
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:13,160
Here, Kirito.

1294
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:17,160
It felt odd just getting something from you,
so here's something from me.

1295
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:19,080
Thanks.

1296
01:53:24,330 --> 01:53:27,750
This time, actually put it on my finger,
and let's continue from where we left off.

1297
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:44,770
<i>A shooting star!</i>

1298
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:51,780
<i>It's amazing!</i>

1299
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:17,800
In the second edition of "The Complete SAO Incident Records,"
the following text was added.

1300
01:54:17,930 --> 01:54:24,390
"There was a diva who gave courage to the swordsmen as they set off
to fight... We must never forget any of the nameless players..."

1301
01:59:17,150 --> 01:59:21,190
What's the reason
for bringing me here, Kikuoka?

1302
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:26,910
I'm grateful that I wasn't charged with a crime,
but what are you planning to make me do?

1303
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:32,870
I was very interested in what I saw of your AI.

1304
01:59:32,950 --> 01:59:36,620
I feel as though I've seen how far
a top-down AI can go.

1305
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:41,000
However, I do believe
in another future, as well.

1306
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:45,170
As the head of the Shigemura Lab,

1307
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:48,390
which produced both Akihiko Kayaba
and Nobuyuki Sugou,

1308
01:59:48,430 --> 01:59:51,850
there's something that
I'd very much like you to see.

1309
01:59:54,470 --> 01:59:56,980
Kikuoka, what on earth is this?

1310
01:59:58,650 --> 02:00:00,650
Welcome to Hath.
