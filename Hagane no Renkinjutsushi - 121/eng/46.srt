1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,480
I knew you would come.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,750
I'm sure you know how I feel.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,640
I know some things have happened
 between you guys and me

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,990
but you and I are 
essentially very similar.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,500
I wonder if that's the reason why Edward-kun doesn't want to see me.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,580
Brother doesn't want to use the Philosopher's Stone.

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,780
That's funny.

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,840
You brothers were, you know...

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,700
We journeyed together to 
get back that which we had lost.

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,850
That's everything that we are.

11
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,780
Are you in pain, Nina?

12
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,750
It's all right.

13
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,530
All preparations 
are in order now...

14
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:10,550
Your body, as well as the lives which were provided by many animals...

15
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,550
All that's left now is to join them all together

16
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,050
with the Philosopher's Stone.

17
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,890
How did you know about me 
having the Philosopher's Stone?

18
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,830
Simple reasoning.

19
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,810
Judging by the injuries to Archer, I could tell what had happened.

20
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,300
At the center of it was Scar, 
the scarred man.

21
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,610
And then I heard that 
you two had fled.

22
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:40,280
King Bradley only wants one thing: the Philosopher's Stone.

23
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,120
You knew?

24
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,330
About the FÃ¼hrer 
being a homunculus?

25
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,270
Hey now, how many years do you think I spent in the 5th Laboratory, anyway?

26
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,050
They used to go there, 
along with that other one.

27
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,400
That other one?

28
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,880
The one who raised and 
is leading the homunculi.

29
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,370
Just a moment. 
By any chance, is that person...

30
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,680
We'll talk later.

31
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,860
You have obtained something that 
they wanted so bad they can't stand it.

32
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:12,570
Now, bring it out! 
A real, genuine Philosopher's Stone!

33
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,320
Please do not touch me.

34
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,530
<i>I</i> am the Philosopher's Stone.

35
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,050
This is a surprise.

36
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,210
So that's the reason why 
Edward-kun didn't come, is it?

37
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,210
Yes. We don't know 
what will happen to my body

38
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,850
if we use the Philosopher's Stone,

39
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,070
at least not until 
we carefully research it.

40
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,320
He said he wanted to do something about the homunculi before then.

41
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,320
I know that Brother 
is worried about me.

42
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,490
But I want to return Brother to the way he used to be.

43
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,200
If you know of 
a way to do that...

44
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,060
Of course I do. I will teach you 
how to use the Philosopher's Stone.

45
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:58,590
However, I want you to 
let me use its power as well.

46
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,820
An equivalent exchange.

47
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,160
The Philosopher's Stone.

48
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:14,350
Those who obtain it are set free from the Law of Equivalent Exchange.

49
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,170
There is no need to pay a price 
in order to obtain something, either.

50
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,970
We sought it and found it.

51
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,020
The reason I want to spit these creaky old memories out

52
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,020
kishinda omoi o hakidashitai no wa

53
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,800
The reason I want to spit these creaky old memories out

54
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,800
kishinda omoi o hakidashitai no wa

55
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:47,190
is because I don't have any other proof of my existence

56
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:47,190
sonzai no shoumei ga hoka ni nai kara

57
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:52,540
The future that I thought I had grabbed hold of

58
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:52,540
tsukanda hazu no boku no mirai wa

59
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:58,040
is a contradiction of dignity and freedom

60
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:58,040
'songen' to 'jiyuu' de mujun shiteru yo

61
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:08,640
The reason I want to wipe away this distorted afterimage

62
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:08,640
yuganda zanzou o keshisaritai no wa

63
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,730
is because I see my own limitations within it

64
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,730
jibun no genkai o soko ni miru kara

65
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,030
is because I see my own limitations within it

66
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,030
jibun no genkai o soko ni miru kara

67
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,390
In the window of my overly self-conscious self

68
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,390
jiishikikajou na boku no mado ni wa

69
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:19,650
is last year's calendar, without any dates written in

70
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:19,650
kyonen no calendar, hizuke ga nai yo

71
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:24,700
is last year's calendar, without any dates written in

72
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:24,700
kyonen no calendar, hizuke ga nai yo

73
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,620
I'll erase it and rewrite it

74
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,620
keshite rewrite shite

75
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,240
with nonsensical surrealism

76
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,240
kudaranai chougensou

77
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,090
and an unforgettable sense of presence

78
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,090
wasurarenu sonzaikan o

79
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:40,300
Return from the brink of death, and rewrite it

80
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:40,300
kishikaisei rewrite shite

81
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,000
Even meaningless figments of imagination

82
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,000
imi no nai souzou mo

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,200
can be the driving force that gives you form

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,200
kimi o nasu gendouryoku

85
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,460
Give your whole body and soul to me

86
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,460
zenshinzenrei o kure yo

87
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,950
Human Transmutation

88
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,950
Human Transmutation

89
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,330
Most of it has been disposed of.

90
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,200
These books are all worthless.

91
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,210
What kind of person was Dante-san?

92
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,650
She was a great alchemist, 
one who inherited this crest.

93
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,050
Or that's what I thought.

94
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,210
What you thought?

95
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,920
She was positively ingenious in her knowledge of alchemy

96
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,720
and hid it completely.

97
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,130
Doesn't that go without saying?

98
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:36,410
I mean, we encrypt our secrets 
about alchemy and record them too.

99
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,880
She was incorrigible about it.

100
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,480
If alchemy was for the good of mankind, why hide it?

101
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,500
She chose to live a life in the forest, where she wouldn't meet anyone.

102
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,490
For what reason?

103
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,780
I thought you would be thrilled.

104
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,550
Does this mean that you were just another ordinary person?

105
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,920
I'm leaving the forest 
to live in the cityâ€”

106
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,050
among the people who need me.

107
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,440
So you're going to live your life 
for the gratitude of others?

108
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,060
Then why don't you just go ahead and enlist as a State Alchemist?

109
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,270
Don't you...

110
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,270
Get out of here.

111
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,440
Don't you...

112
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,530
Don't you like other people?

113
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,560
How could I like them?

114
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,940
They're selfish creatures without any merit.

115
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,520
They learn how to use a little gunpowder, and there is nothing but war.

116
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,210
If they were to learn all of the secrets of alchemy,

117
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,960
how much calamity do you think would come about?

118
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,550
Even so, I am human! 
And so are you!

119
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,510
There was one name that you could never utter in her presence:

120
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,060
Hohenheim of Light.

121
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,820
M-My old man?

122
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,560
Yeah. Looks like she couldn't 
bring herself to throw this away.

123
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,830
It's a love letter from 
Hohenheim to Dante.

124
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,880
J-Just a minute! I met Dante-san, and she was pretty old.

125
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,820
She looked like she was twenty years older than my old man.

126
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,160
That's not what the issue is.

127
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,860
This has the year written on it 
in the Christian calendar.

128
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,050
The Christian calendar?

129
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,300
It was based on an ancient religion that isn't practiced now.

130
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,810
According to this, the letter...

131
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,310
was written four hundred years ago.

132
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,480
What does it mean?

133
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,240
I don't know.

134
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,850
Maybe the names are just the same.

135
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,870
It's possible that the one 
controlling all the homunculi is...

136
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,530
You're jumping to conclusions.

137
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,080
But are you prepared for that, 
just in case?

138
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,670
Sorry I couldn't be of any help.

139
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,740
It's okay. This is something we'll do by ourselves.

140
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,350
Sensei...

141
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,310
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,820
You fool...

143
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,920
It's about to happen?

145
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,260
If war breaks out in the north,

146
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,350
it'll be different from the civil uprisings 
we've had up to now.

147
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,780
Sorry I'm laid up 
at a time like this.

148
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,510
It's just about time.

149
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,300
Havoc, you won't get lonely.

150
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,520
You'll have another friend.

151
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,960
Sergeant Fuery, 
some nasty athlete's foot

152
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,450
was discovered during your examination the other day.

153
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,430
It has already spread to your brain.

154
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:12,750
That's how it goes. 
You won't be moving out either.

155
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,700
Not bad.

156
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,710
Surely, you jest.

157
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,100
Clearly, the north is 
engaging in military actions,

158
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,800
and we cannot help but say that it would be foolish

159
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,220
to overlook this and take up the matter 
of our already established borders again.

160
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,730
However, the FÃ¼hrer has 
come to a wise conclusion.

161
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,560
We will gather our forces in the Briggs Mountains, 
along the border to the north,

162
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,290
where we will purge 
any and all infiltrators!

163
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,570
You who are assembled here today 
are the best of the best

164
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,570
and will be the first ones there!

165
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,580
I'm sorry for all of these 
difficult missions in a row.

166
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,580
I feel it's an honor.

167
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:10,190
I believe the suspicions 
about you are unfounded.

168
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,590
This is my proof of that.

169
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,820
I will live up to your expectations, 
Your Excellency.

170
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,790
I wish you good luck, 
Brigadier General Roy Mustang.

171
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:24,350
Lt. Col. Alex Louis Armstrong, support him well for me.

172
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,180
Yes, sir. However, with our main forces 
concentrated in the north,

173
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,350
I am concerned for 
the defense of Central.

174
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,070
Do not worry. 
Frank Archer is eager to help.

175
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,320
Archer?!

176
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,320
You mean, that man is still alive?

177
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,090
A job well done, FÃ¼hrer.

178
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,610
There are no legends of the 
Philosopher's Stone in the north.

179
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,810
Even by fanning the flames of war,

180
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,290
there isn't anyone there who will be 
driven to create a Philosopher's Stone.

181
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,290
That's all right. Your purpose this time 
is the leadership of the military.

182
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,450
Anyone who comes near the 
Philosopher's Stone is destroyed.

183
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,470
Those who are soldiers 
are not excepted.

184
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,670
Then it's not just Mustang.

185
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:46,020
No. Everyone who was involved with 
the Hughes affair is going to die in battle.

186
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,180
Courtesy of Envy.

187
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,910
If you mean me, I'm right here.

188
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,530
Oh, I thought I told you 
to wait up north.

189
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,170
I heard that <i>he</i> was here.

190
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,610
You're being rude, Envy.

191
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,570
Out of my way, you human poser!

192
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,780
I won't have you 
talk to him like that.

193
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:09,060
He is a homunculus that appears to age 
like a person and is one of my masterpieces.

194
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,040
Where is he?!

195
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,040
"He" who?

196
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:19,430
That guy! The same way you made Pride and
 Greed! He's toying with meâ€”toying with us!

197
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,930
Hohenheim of Light?

198
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,550
He's here, right?! Where is he?!

199
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,640
You miss your birth father?

200
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,270
Where is he?!

201
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,740
He's dead.

202
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,840
You're lying!

203
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,480
There's no way he could die!

204
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,730
I'm the one who will 
kill him, after all!

205
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,450
I disrupted the union of 
his spirit, body, and mind.

206
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,610
He's as good as dead.

207
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,200
It's not true! It's not true! Why didn't you tell me?!

208
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,950
He was supposed to be mine! 
Mine! Mine!

209
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,320
Mine!

210
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,960
His sons are still alive.

211
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,670
To hell with them!

212
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,170
Even once you hear that they have obtained a Philosopher's Stone?

213
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,300
They have a Philosopher's Stone?

214
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:09,270
That's right. At this rate, those boys are going to take everything back.

215
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,220
I won't let them.

216
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,550
It's unfair, isn't it?

217
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,310
Those boys getting to take everything back,

218
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,520
while you, who should be 
his dearest son...

219
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,730
are unable to obtain anything.

220
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,900
I want to see them...

221
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,490
the expressions on their faces when the 
Philosopher's Stone is taken from them.

222
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,050
Their expressions when they lose everything.

223
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,440
"I'm going to Tucker-san's place."

224
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,710
Shou Tucker. I thought he ran away at Liore.

225
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:47,720
Hold on. Why do you think Tucker called him there?

226
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:52,600
That's obvious. To complete that useless Chimera of his.

227
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,350
It's his daughter.

228
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,020
Tucker learned a lot of things from the 5th Laboratory,

229
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,820
including things about 
the Philosopher's Stone.

230
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,370
And since he knows,

231
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:05,360
the Fullmetal brothers will know 
how to use the Philosopher's Stone too.

232
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,860
What are you thinking, Lust?

233
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,530
Wrath,

234
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,250
take care of everything 
else here for me.

235
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,180
You're leaving?!

236
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,670
That's a good boy.

237
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:28,180
My word, your brother is a genius.

238
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:33,500
He struck upon this seven-sided transmutation circle right on the spot.

239
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,180
You mean, you just copied it?

240
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,510
I'd like you to say that 
I expanded on it.

241
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,770
But still, the fact is, Edward-kun came very close to the truth.

242
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:49,410
He probably realized that this method could be used to activate the Philosopher's Stone as well.

243
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,410
Brother was concerned 
about my body.

244
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:59,960
He just thought you should be giving precedence to regenerating your body.

245
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,880
He doesn't seem to have any interest in using the Philosopher's Stone.

246
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,090
Why not?

247
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,090
It's probably because...

248
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,550
Nothing...

249
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,720
Could you come 
over here for me?

250
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,030
Tucker-san!

251
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,960
I'm going to have you 
pay me in advance.

252
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,070
Don't worry. 
Bringing Nina back to life

253
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:41,040
will be nothing at all for a 
Philosopher's Stone as huge as this.

254
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,290
Please wait! I'm still...

255
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,000
Nina, Nina, it will be soon now...

256
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,550
Tucker-san!

257
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,510
Al?

258
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,730
Al!

259
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,230
You dumbass!

260
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:04,150
You're looking well, for someone being pursued by the military.

261
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,650
I heard about what you are 
from my brother.

262
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,360
I am who I am.

263
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
Wrong.

264
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,640
Don't try anything funny.

265
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,700
What are you hiding?

266
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,840
I told you I knew 
what you were!

267
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,210
Wrath!

268
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,710
Today's the day 
when I will have them!

269
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,210
Sorry, but they're not for sale!

270
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,720
S-Stop!

271
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,770
Wrath!

272
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,750
If you're going to beg for your life, 
I'm not listening.

273
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,490
Oh, that's all right. If you want my arm or leg, take them.

274
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,590
I've got the greatest 
Automail mechanic around.

275
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,620
She'll give me something even cooler.

276
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,610
What?

277
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,450
But answer me one thingâ€”

278
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,290
if you take my arm and leg from me 
and attach them to yourself,

279
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,620
will that make you human?

280
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,820
Even if I have to use Automailâ€”

281
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:08,380
even if my whole body becomes armor, 
so what? I'm still human.

282
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,290
But what about you?

283
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,380
Shut up!

284
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,430
Lust! What are you doing?!

285
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,980
Get him! If you don't kill him, 
I'm telling you-know-who on you!

286
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,910
Get him, Lust!

287
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,280
You want to become human too, 
don't you?

288
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,360
If there is a Philosopher's Stone, yes.

289
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:46,030
Your little brother went off to Tucker's place 
and is learning how to do it.

290
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,630
If you find out how...

291
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,340
Lust, what are you saying?!

292
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,760
Would you...

293
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,090
make me human?

294
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,640
Lust!

295
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,800
What do you think you're doing?!

296
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,830
I told you.

297
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:10,190
Cut it out. Do you seriously think I would make you guys human?

298
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,480
Why not?

299
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:17,150
If you were to make us human, 
you wouldn't be chased after any longer.

300
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,490
Your enemies would be gone.

301
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,300
You traitor!

302
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,220
What were we told?

303
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,340
You heard! Once we delivered the 
Philosopher's Stone, we would be made human!

304
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,130
I don't believe it...

305
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:42,480
You-know-who only wants the Philosopher's Stone to go on living.

306
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,390
That's why there have 
been so many wars.

307
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,650
That person is not going to make us human.

308
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,520
That's okay. I...

309
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,240
will become human 
under my own power!

310
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:02,950
It's just as I was told. 
"You can't trust Lust."

311
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,950
You're a nuisance, lady.

312
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,720
Let's go.

313
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,270
We have to hurry.

314
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,680
Sloth is going after your brother.

315
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,770
Do you know where Tucker is?

316
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,780
The factory where he worked

317
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,030
before he became 
a State Alchemist is close.

318
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,420
Wait. Wait!

319
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,160
It's not as though 
I promised you anything.

320
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,660
Why not?

321
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,380
<i>I</i> should be the one asking why! 
Why do you want to become human?!

322
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,350
You guys are immortal and can 
remain in your present forms forever.

323
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,280
I'm not sure why, but you 
look like you enjoy your lives.

324
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,930
So why would you want to become human again?

325
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,140
That's such a cruel thing 
for you to say.

326
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,760
In that case, why do you have to return your brother back to the way he was?

327
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,240
It's the same thing.

328
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:18,400
Hey!

329
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,150
This "you-know-who" person who's in charge of youâ€”

330
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,310
by any chance, 
is it someone I know?

331
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,100
Good question.

332
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,450
Once I become human, 
I wouldn't mind telling you.

333
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,960
Don't forget,

334
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,270
I'm still carrying your weakness!

335
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,450
I won't forget.

336
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,080
There's no way I could forget.

337
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,570
Nina, is that right?

338
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,730
What happened?

339
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,730
That's great, really.

340
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,990
Alphonse-kun. Thanks.

341
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,460
It's Nina.

342
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,650
See? She knows what I'm saying.

343
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,000
Right, Nina?

344
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,210
Call me Papa, Nina.

345
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,410
Her soul...

346
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,840
Congratulations, Shou Tucker.

347
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:31,770
That was a magnificent human transmutation.

348
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,770
It's okay.

349
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,570
I'm not interested in 
your soulless doll.

350
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:41,780
Only a powerful will is able to 
keep a soul set in place.

351
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,360
Looks like that wasn't 
possible for you.

352
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,280
Come along, Alphonse Elric.

353
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,790
We can't very well let such a precious Philosopher's Stone be diminished any further.

354
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,790
Diminished?

355
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,510
Brother, Brother, is this...

356
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,490
the Philosopher's Stone?!

357
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,220
As my tears well up,

358
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,220
afuredasu namida nara

359
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,390
I don't have to stop them now

360
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,390
ima wa tomenakute ii

361
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:17,710
I don't have to stop them now

362
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:17,710
ima wa tomenakute ii

363
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,500
At the end of all the grief,

364
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,500
kanashimi no saigo ni wa

365
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,380
the light is sure to shine through

366
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,380
hikari ga sashikomu hazu

367
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:33,370
Stay... stay... stay... stay...

368
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:42,680
It's true, I cannot see you now,

369
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:42,680
sou, ima anata ni aenai kedo

370
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,780
but by hiding the heartache,

371
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,780
setsunai omoi kakushite

372
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,900
I can become stronger

373
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,900
tsuyoku nareru,

374
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:58,220
And I will go on making sure of that

375
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:58,220
motto tashikameteyuku no

376
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,730
As my tears well up,

377
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,730
afuredasu namida nara

378
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,460
I don't have to stop them now

379
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,460
ima wa tomenakute ii

380
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,230
Nor will I forget the pain

381
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,230
yasashisa ni kawatteku

382
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,490
as it becomes kindness

383
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,490
itami mo wasurenai

384
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:14,930
as it becomes kindness

385
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:14,930
itami mo wasurenai

386
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:22,630
That which I ruined in my haste,

387
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:22,630
isogisugite kowashitekita mono

388
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,710
I will take back so that

389
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,710
torimodosu no

390
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:33,130
I can walk on as I would

391
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:33,130
watashirashiku aruku tame ni

392
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,860
for you

393
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,390
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

394
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,920
Sealing the Homunculus

395
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,870
Sealing the Homunculus

396
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,940
Sealing the Homunculus

397
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:43,880
Episode 47: "Sealing the Homunculus"

398
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,520
Look, Sloth.

399
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,740
Your weakness is right here.
