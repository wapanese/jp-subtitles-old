1
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,860
For crying out loud...

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,230
Why is she telling us to cool our heads here for a while?

3
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,870
Leaving us alone in a place like this 
won't be any trouble for us anymore.

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,150
Being forbidden to use alchemy—

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,860
it's like when we were training here that one time, huh?

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,200
Do you think that maybe Sensei doesn't feel like we've made any progress at all?

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,710
That couldn't be it.

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,000
Just a minute! Al! Ed!

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,980
Don't get so upset. 
You'll fall in.

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,440
Okay...

11
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,440
Why are you doing this?

12
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,950
That is a good question.

13
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:50,940
Yeah.

14
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,910
Don't just "yeah" me!

15
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,600
I don't understand the reason why you're leaving the two of them

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,310
on an uninhabited island 
all of a sudden!

17
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,810
It's a good question.

18
00:00:58,810 --> 00:00:59,950
Yeah.

19
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,000
Jeez! What in the world 
are you thinking?!

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,490
This is good to do 
every now and then.

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,700
It's nice to stop and think things over once in a while.

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,460
It's something those two need to do right now.

23
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,830
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,420
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

25
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,470
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

26
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,990
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,660
Far away, far away, our dreams will never fade

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,660
tooku tooku omoi hatenaku

29
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,960
If only the two of us could go back to

30
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,960
futari ga mujaki ni waratteta

31
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,810
the days when we laughed so innocently

32
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,810
ano koro ni modoreru nara

33
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,910
the days when we laughed so innocently

34
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,910
ano koro ni modoreru nara

35
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,740
Just like glassware

36
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,740
konagona ni kudaketa

37
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:14,340
that has been smashed to pieces,

38
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:14,340
glass-zaiku no you na

39
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:22,130
we're putting together the fragments of our memories

40
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:22,130
omoide no kakera o atsumeteru

41
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,920
It's the important things that you notice

42
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,920
daiji na mono wa itsudatte

43
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,740
It's the important things that you notice

44
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,740
daiji na mono wa itsudatte

45
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:33,490
once you've lost them

46
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:33,490
nakushite kara kizuku yo

47
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,740
Oh, please, oh, please, stop time for me,

48
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,740
douka douka jikan o tomete

49
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:46,320
and engrave the way you look right now into my heart

50
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:46,320
kimi no omokage o kono mune ni kizandekure

51
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,870
And if, and if, I were ever allowed to,

52
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,870
moshimo moshimo yurusareru nara

53
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,280
I would be willing to sacrifice everything

54
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,280
subete o gisei ni shitemo ii

55
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,930
just to see that smiling face one more time

56
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,930
ano egao o mou ichido

57
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,920
One Is All, All Is One

58
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,920
One Is All, All Is One

59
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,110
Al...

60
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,800
Should we run away?

61
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,580
We can't! 
After all, I can't swim!

62
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,930
Come to think of it, 
neither can I.

63
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,940
That's right. We're not 
the same as we used to be.

64
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,410
Not us.

65
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,060
This is fun, huh, Brother?

66
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,460
Sure is. It's been a long time since 
we've been out sightseeing like this.

67
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,580
Sightseeing?

68
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,390
That's rich!

69
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,930
Here, take this.

70
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,640
A knife?

71
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,800
This is an uninhabited island, after all.

72
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,430
No electricity, no wells, no houses to shelter you from the rain,

73
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,430
and no wild animals... at least, probably not.

74
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,030
For one month, you two are to 
survive by yourselves on this island.

75
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,480
Oh, and during that time, 
the use of alchemy is prohibited.

76
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,290
What is this?!

77
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,180
I'll come to pick you up 
in one month.

78
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,030
J-Just a sec!

79
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,300
One is all, all is one.

80
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,110
If you don't find 
the answer in one month,

81
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,520
I'm sending you 
back to Resembool.

82
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,240
See ya!

83
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,900
One is all, all is one.

84
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,110
We understand it now, 
but at the time...

85
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:09,260
Yeah. We didn't have a clue 
what she was saying—not at the time.

86
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,200
One is all, all is one.

87
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,760
Good grief, that auntie has given us homework that doesn't make sense.

88
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,880
One is all, all is one. 
What could it mean?

89
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,270
Is it a riddle? 
I don't get it at all.

90
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,950
But unless we give her an answer in a month, 
we won't get any real training.

91
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:48,000
Aw, jeez! How is this supposed to be alchemy training?!

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,510
That auntie tricked us!

93
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,830
Let's go to sleep.

94
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,820
How about we get up early tomorrow and find some food?

95
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,830
Mm-hmm.

96
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,490
Al? You going to the bathroom?

97
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,440
What is it, Brother? You can use the bathroom by yourself...

98
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,630
You idiot! Open your eyes!

99
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,390
Get out!

100
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,710
You've gotta be kidding! 
If we run, then our training will be—

101
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,280
Brother!

102
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,740
Damn!

103
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,500
Al!

104
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,480
Damn...

105
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,770
Al!

106
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:40,910
Run!

107
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,600
Okay!

108
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:05,210
Now what? 
Don't get lost on me, Al...

109
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,150
I don't taste good!

110
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,300
Brother, it's me!

111
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,510
Al! Thank goodness! 
I thought I'd lost you!

112
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,240
It's a fox.

113
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,690
Ah, there's two of them.

114
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,360
How'd it go?

115
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,410
We've got dinner!

116
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,790
Make sure to dry off, 
or else you'll rust.

117
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,710
Right.

118
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:31,060
Who was that man?! I'm scared! I'm scared to death!

119
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,410
And she said there were no wild animals here!

120
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,680
There's something even worse than wild animals here!

121
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,480
What should we do?

122
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,340
What can we do?

123
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,050
It's another month before they're coming for us.

124
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,560
For the time being, we can't fight on empty stomachs.

125
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,400
You did it!

126
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,280
We've got food!

127
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,400
We can catch it with 
the right kind of trap!

128
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,900
So...

129
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,430
How do we eat it?

130
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,630
We stick it!

131
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,870
We stick it?

132
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,000
You'll have to do it.

133
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,530
No! Brother, you do it! 
I've never killed an animal before.

134
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,160
Neither have I!

135
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,120
That's not fair! You always force me to do the things you don't want to!

136
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,940
I what?!

137
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,190
Hold it!

138
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,610
You're not getting away from us!

139
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,620
Brother!

140
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,450
Are you okay? 
You're hurt pretty bad!

141
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,320
That damned fox!

142
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,490
Where'd he go? That bastard!

143
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,140
Brother!

144
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,640
It has children.

145
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,460
I wonder if she's their mother.

146
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,260
Mm-hmm.

147
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,950
Let's give up on meat 
and go for fish...

148
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,030
I wonder if you can eat fox...

149
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,050
Take it easy.

150
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,660
Got one!

151
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,110
Fire!

152
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,990
Food!

153
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,610
We humbly partake!

154
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,630
All right!

155
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,000
Brother...

156
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,880
What's the matter?

157
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,390
Yow!

158
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,600
Just come with me.

159
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,600
Ow-ow-ow!

160
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,600
What is this?

161
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,330
Don't give me "what is this?"

162
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,260
Don't dig right in just 
because you're hungry!

163
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,510
It wasn't me.

164
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,610
But...

165
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,060
Your handprint is right here.

166
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,690
Take a close look.

167
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,610
This is a right hand.

168
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,410
Sure enough, someone's here.

169
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,580
Here? You don't mean...

170
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:56,590
It's possible that Sensei brought them here for the same reason.

171
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,640
Brother, where are you going?

172
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,460
Let's go check around. We'll find something to eat while we're at it, too.

173
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,890
There's no way we're giving up! Twenty-eight more days!

174
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,380
Say...

175
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,140
What did we come here for, again?

176
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,730
Beats me...

177
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:34,520
What would happen 
if we died here?

178
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,680
No way...

179
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,470
Winry and Grandma 
would grieve for us.

180
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,880
There's still a lot of 
things I want to do.

181
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,200
All of this... What does it 
have to do with alchemy?!

182
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,700
I've had enough! 
I want to go home!

183
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,840
<i>Where is he?</i>

184
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,660
<i>This guy...</i>

185
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,850
I found some food for Brother.

186
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,560
Brother!

187
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,250
Come look!

188
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,580
Brother? I wonder what's the matter...

189
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,820
You called, Al?

190
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,070
Brother!

191
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,980
Then who was that just now?

192
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,630
Why, you!

193
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,570
<i>A cicada?</i>

194
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,690
<i>I get it...</i>

195
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,570
<i>It's dead...</i>

196
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,450
<i>Death...</i>

197
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,840
<i>When you die,</i>

198
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,580
<i>this is what happens...</i>

199
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,430
Let go of Al...

200
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,440
Let go of Al!

201
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,870
We talked about what would happen if we died here, remember?

202
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,320
Mm-hmm. Everyone would grieve.

203
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,680
Um, that's the subjective part.

204
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,250
Looking at it objectively,

205
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:31,080
if I died, the world would keep on going 
as if nothing had happened.

206
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,820
Your existence is a tiny one.

207
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,010
Don't call me small!

208
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,150
Ee-yow!

209
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:41,190
Well, if I, with my small existence, 
were to die, my body would still remain.

210
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,340
Water, carbon, ammonia, lime,

211
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:49,970
phosphorous, saltpeter, salt, sulfur, magnesium, fluorine, manganese, and aluminum, right?

212
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:50,920
Right.

213
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,720
That and a handful of other elemental compounds are all that I am, right?

214
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,320
My body, I mean.

215
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,600
After all, I'm fated to be 
broken down by bacteria

216
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,190
and become nourishment for plants.

217
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,380
But then those plants will raise grazing animals...

218
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,030
And the grazing animals will feed carnivorous animals...

219
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,060
Without even being aware of it, we naturally go on circulating.

220
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,740
I'm sorry about this.

221
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,680
There's a giant flow that 
we can't see with our eyes.

222
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,830
Whether you call it the universe, or the world, I don't know,

223
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:36,320
but, Al, you and I are one little part within the larger flow.

224
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,340
One within all.

225
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,630
However, all of the ones have to 
come together for the all to exist.

226
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:47,250
The world follows the flow of 
greater laws that we can't even imagine.

227
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,360
We learn that flow, 
break it down, and reconstruct it.

228
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,040
And that's alchemy.

229
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,590
Thirty days!

230
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,620
We've got breakfast!

231
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,120
It is the appointed day.

232
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,920
One is all, all is one. 
Let's hear your answer.

233
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,750
"All" is the world!

234
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,920
"One" is me!

235
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,640
Very well.

236
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,630
We'll move on to real training.

237
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,140
All right!

238
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,400
I guess that guy isn't here after all.

239
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,590
That's okay, isn't it? We more or less got what Sensei was trying to tell us.

240
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,560
Mm-hmm.

241
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,560
Back then,

242
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,900
we arrived at the answer.

243
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:52,070
But still, that alone wasn't enough.

244
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,820
The truth is, back then,

245
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,540
we should have realized that 
transmuting Mom was a mistake.

246
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:07,510
It could be that everything 
we're about to do is, as well.

247
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,520
I'm sure Sensei would agree.

248
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,870
Have you remembered?

249
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,040
Yes.

250
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,630
Do you realize it?

251
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:37,010
Um, Sensei, what you're trying to tell us is...

252
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,380
It's true that we did try to transmute our mom.

253
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,760
The way we are now 
is the outcome of that.

254
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,260
However, that is precisely why 
we want to get everything back.

255
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,770
You intend to get back through error that which you lost through error?

256
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,270
Maybe it is wrong of us...

257
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,780
But...

258
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,620
if that's the case,

259
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,280
what are we supposed to do?

260
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,250
We're going to move forward.

261
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,830
We are...

262
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,290
still alive, after all.

263
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,130
And that's enough?

264
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,630
Yes!

265
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,450
In that case...

266
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,630
Is someone there?

267
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,860
What are you talking about?

268
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,890
Hasn't someone been living on this island since long ago?

269
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,640
You think it could be that 
masked man from before?

270
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,140
That couldn't be. 
The reason being, that was me.

271
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,400
Wh-What do you mean?!

272
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,570
Just in case, I had him keep watch, since I couldn't let you die on me.

273
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,400
S-So then...!

274
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,410
Apparently, that doesn't 
seem to be the case here.

275
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:14,290
On the day you left,

276
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:14,290
On the day you left,

280
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:21,580

284
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,800
