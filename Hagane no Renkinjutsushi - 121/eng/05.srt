1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,700
Let's see...

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,870
Sorry to keep you waiting.

3
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,330
I-Is this Lt. Col. Roy Mustang? 
My humble name is Edward Elric...

4
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,200
Humble?

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,840
You don't have to be so tense.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,340
R-Right! We'll be boarding the 9:20 train bound for Central.

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,050
Roger.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,340
Er, hold on...

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,850
There's one before that, isn't there?

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,040
Yes there is, but it sounds like it's already leaving.

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,040
Now departing! Now departing!

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,030
Get on that one.

13
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,350
But why?

14
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,950
Just hop aboard that one!

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,570
Al!

16
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,120
We're getting on!

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,400
Hurry!

18
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,580
Lieutenant Colonel Mustang

19
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,580
Lieutenant Colonel Mustang

20
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,580
I'm testing their luck.

21
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,530
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

22
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,130
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,170
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,270
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

25
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,980
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

26
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,980
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

27
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,980
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

29
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:36,450
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

30
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:36,450
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

31
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:36,450
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

32
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:36,450

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:36,650
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

34
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:36,650
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

35
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:36,650
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

36
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:36,650

00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,450
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

41
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:45,490
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

42
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,450
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

43
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,450
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

45
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,200
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,920
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

50
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,320
Looking at the sky, 
thinking tomorrow must be coming,

51
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,320
asu ga kuru hazu no sora wo mite

52
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:05,820
it's too much for my captivated heart to take

53
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:05,820
mayou bakari no kokoro mote amashite iru

54
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,570
As a bird flutters along beside me,

00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,570
katawara no tori ga habataita

56
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:16,670
I wonder where he managed to find his light

57
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:16,670
doko ka hikari wo mitsukerareta no ka na

58
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,570
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

59
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,570
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

60

Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

61
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,110
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

62
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,110
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

64
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:27,280
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

65
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:27,280
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

66
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,670
And leave me at the highest place there is,

67
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,670
And leave me at the highest place there is,

68
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,670
soshite ichiban takai tokoro de

69
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,670

70
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,560
far away from kindness?

71
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,560
okizari ni shite, yasashisa kara toozakete

72
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:49,930

85
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,960
Dash! Automail

86
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,900
I don't get Lt. Col. Mustang.

87
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,850
I wonder what kind of person he is.

88
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,130
Brother,

89
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,870
am I scary?

90
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,140
No, I wouldn't sayâ€”

91
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,450
Say, there's someone strange over there!

92
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,320
Strange?

93
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,830
Marin, that's not nice. Keep quiet.

94
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,850
But he's funny!

95
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:54,460
For him to wear his armor inside the train, 
he must really like it, huh?

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,200
There's nothing particularly strange about us!

97
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,610
There, you see? 
She likes you! Right?

98
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,370
Pretty cool, huh?

99
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,230
There now, Marin, 
that's enough already.

100
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,970
General Hakuro

101
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,970
General Hakuro

102
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,970
Looks like they're tuckered out 
from too much romping around.

103
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,490
Yes.

104
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,900
I'm so glad that you've been able to travel 
like this without any incident, General Hakuro.

105
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,570
They said that the situation to the east was unstable, but then here we are.

106
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,920
Warrant Officer Falman

107
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,920
Warrant Officer Falman

108
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,130
My, my, the higher-ups sure do take it easy.

109
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,280
By the way, where is 
Maj. Hughes right now?

110
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,890
He is communicating with
Lt. Col. Mustang about that other matter.

111
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,020
That other matter?

112
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,710
Yes.

113
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,710
Well, I hope so...

114
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,940
So, you see...

115
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,440
Major Hughes

116
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,440
Major Hughes

117
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,220
Ever since my wife got pregnant, 
she's been getting prettier by the day.

118
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,880
How should I put it?

119
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,720
She's like an angel who has 
waltzed her way down to earthâ€”

120
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,680
Huh?

121
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,150
We got cut off again. What lousy conditions for communications!

122
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,980
I can't do anything with this!

123
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,900
<i>You're</i> the one we 
can't do anything with!

124
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,950
I'd better make another round to keep myself from worrying.

125
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,000
Hello?

126
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,350
My, my...

127
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,110
So, listen, what am I going to do if the baby is born tomorrow?

128
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,380
Hughes...

129
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,620
I've heard this story 
about fifty times now.

130
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:00,210
If you want to talk about this, 
take it up with your wife directly!

131
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,630
I have! Just a little while ago!

132
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,380
Then don't ask me!

133
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,050
Major Hawkeye

134
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,050
Major Hawkeye

135
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,050
Pardon me for breaking in.

136
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,550
Major, a piece of advice...

137
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,890
The baby won't be born after just five months!

138
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,140
Huh? What was that?

139
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,270
I can't hear too well 
over this phone.

140
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,160
That's suspicious...

141
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,280
That's enough, Hughes.

142
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,740
We just got confirmation that there's no one monitoring communications.

143
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,060
So, how about it?

144
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,590
Have you seen anyone suspicious?

145
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,640
No. Or so I'd like to tell you.

146
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,170
There have been more passengers 
getting on and off than anticipated.

147
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,300
If you factor in the private rooms...

148
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,560
What is it?

149
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,810
They're here!

150
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,600
They're here?

151
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,000
They're here! 
Someone awfully suspicious!

152
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,770
What?!

153
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,270
They're wearing armor this huge!

154
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,650
Armor?

155
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,240
That guy is fine. Is there another...

156
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,960
pipsqueak together with him?

157
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,510
Pip...

158
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,320
...squeak?

159
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,660
He was right! He's here!

160
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,960
And he really <i>is</i> little!

161
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,460
Who are you calling so puny that you can only make him out under a magnifying glass?!

162
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,400
No, I was just...

163
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,340
I'm not the one who said so...

164
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,400
Be quiet! Everyone, put your hands where I can see 'em!

165
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,420
Wh-Why, you...

166
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,090
Good day, General Hakuro.

167
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,350
Hey, Hughes! What is it?
Has something happened?

168
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,790
Hey, Hughes!

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,720
Hey, inform Bald that 
we've taken the wireless!

170
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,030
It doesn't look like anyone was using it, either!

171
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,570
Is it them, after all?

172
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,300
There's a call for headquarters from General Hakuro 
aboard the train heading for Central.

173
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,550
It's an emergency.

174
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,510
Put it through.

175
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,670
It's me.

176
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,630
Lt. Colonel? Is this Lt. Col. Mustang?

177
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,180
This is Bald, of the Eastern
Liberation Front "Blue Squad."

178
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,750
We have taken control of this train.

179
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,060
What are your demands?

180
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,230
Don't play dumb!

181
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,940
We suddenly lost contact with one of our allies today.

182
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,050
Someone who was supposed to have delivered a statement to you.

183
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,240
What are you talking about?

184
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,390
Okay, fine.

185
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,920
Bring our leader in 
Prison No. 8 to Central Station.

186
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,460
We'll exchange prisoners there.

187
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,550
Very well. In exchange, 
do not kill anyone. If you doâ€”

188
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,430
Are you sure about this? 
We do have a statement here,

189
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:44,020
but if the general finds out, 
he's going to ask who was responsible.

190
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,660
No problem.

191
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,730
As long as the situation gets resolved, right?

192
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,730
I've already taken sufficient measures.

193
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,550
What is this man Mustang thinking?

194
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,660
If he does anything funny, then it won't just be you!

195
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,210
Consider all of the passengers dead!

196
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,160
Brother...

197
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,450
Yeah...

198
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,240
Hey, you two...

199
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,430
Why, you!

200
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,340
Hey, now that you've 
done that, what do we do?

201
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,050
When their buddies come to get back at us for this...

202
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,680
He's right.

203
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,200
If you hadn't resisted, we probably would've gotten to Central without any trouble.

204
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,250
He's right...

205
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,900
What do we do?

206
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,310
You're asking me?

207
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,870
Are you all right?!

208
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,080
Yes...

209
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,970
Sorry about that. Your big brothers 
will take care of this somehow, okay?

210
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,880
Let's go, Al.

211
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,440
Yeah.

212
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,400
Hey, you guys!

213
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,400
This is embarrassing.

214
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,600
Who on earth are you?

215
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,340
We're just ordinary alchemists.

216
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,300
Eh? Really?

217
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,440
I'm Falman. Warrant Officer.

218
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,820
A soldier? You don't look at all like one!

219
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,570
There's a reason why I'm dressed like this.

220
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,350
You see, up in the first car...

221
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,840
Then that's who the criminals are after?

222
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,760
And they're dragging all these people into the middle of it!

223
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,100
Al, I'll go at them from above. 
You take them from below with this man.

224
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,100
O-Okay.

225
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,080
What?

226
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,910
Hey! Come quick!

227
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,880
There's something funny going on behind us!

228
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,510
Ah! You'd better not shoot!

229
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,550
I was about to tell you that you risked ricochets by shooting.

230
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,730
What's going on?!

231
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,650
Ah! You'd better not shoot!

232
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,990
Hey, Bald! Contact from 
behind us has been cut off!

233
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,900
What's going on?!

234
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,580
So, you <i>did</i> have something set up, didn't you?

235
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,200
G-Give up already.

236
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,710
Turn yourselves over, 
and release the other passengers.

237
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,800
Things aren't just going to go your way this time!

238
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,230
Dear!

239
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,750
We're the only ones giving orders here, General.

240
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:54,480
Check all of the cars 
on this train again!

241
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,190
And examine the outside of the cars as well!

242
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,490
Hey, are you all right?

243
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,630
I'm surprised you got this far.

244
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,160
I'm Hughes. Edward Elric-kun, right?

245
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,660
Huh? Y-Yes!

246
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,210
I heard about you 
from Lt. Col. Mustang.

247
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,470
From the Lt. Colonel?!

248
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,730
Yeah.

249
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:33,040
Now then, you'll work with me.

250
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,970
I've already checked things out below us.

251
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,740
What's the matter?

252
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,080
Who are you?!

253
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,220
There you are!

254
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,310
Take this!

255
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,910
Are you all right?!

256
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,820
What?!

257
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,730
Whoa, that was awesome!

258
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,350
Hey, you!

259
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,790
Don't mess around with the tender! It's the life of this train!

260
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,040
Yeah, sorry!

261
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,880
Tender, huh?

262
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,510
You can't, Bald!

263
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,750
There's someone outrageous up there!

264
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,180
Bald!

265
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,660
Contact with everywhere else 
has been cut off!

266
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,350
They said something 
about a big suit of armor!

267
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,510
Calm down!

268
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,570
You guys in the criminal group, can you hear me?

269
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,570
What's that?

270
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,620
All right, you guys!

271
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,450
Threaten everyone else, will you?!

272
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,830
Let the hostages go!

273
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,840
Are you one of Mustang's secret agents?!

274
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,540
If you interfere, 
I'll kill the hostages one by one!

275
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,570
Oh, you're just itching to do it, huh?

276
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,300
Well, then...

277
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,260
A water... pipe?

278
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:39,760
Okay, hostages, please take cover!

279
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,600
What?!

280
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,910
Welcome!

281
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,300
All right, don't move.

282
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,250
You're the ringleader, aren't you?

283
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,200
What's the matter?

284
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,390
Come on out.

285
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,390
<i>Damn!</i>

286
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,550
Before I kill the general,

287
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,100
I'll take care of you!

288
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,190
Hold it!

289
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,910
A fellow Automailer, huh?

290
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,850
A brat like you...?

291
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,330
Is the military using even children now?

292
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,850
You'll pay for that "brat" line!

293
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,840
And I'm not being used by anyone!

294
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,530
Kid, let me tell you something.

295
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,970
I used to be in the military long ago.

296
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,310
At the time, I thought 
I wanted to be better armed.

297
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,850
But the military didn't seem to like that idea.

298
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,240
They were afraid of me becoming any stronger on my own.

299
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,780
Shortly after I had this operation, they got rid of me.

300
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,570
And so... And so...

301
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,450
I wanted to crush the military!

302
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,350
You understand, don't you?

303
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:29,240
If you've got an arm like that, 
then you must've wanted it too!

304
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,300
You wanted to be stronger than anyone else!

305
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,350
No, I don't understand!

306
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,390
And don't you dare lump my arm in...

307
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,970
with yours!

308
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,200
Good grief,

309
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,830
that was something else.

310
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,000
Don't kill anyone.

311
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,820
That's what I told you.

312
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,790
As it turns out, it looks like you did as you were told.

313
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,250
You're Mustang, are you?

314
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,730
A-Awesome!

315
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,700
I held back.

316
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,240
The effect on your body probably isn't as bad as it looks.

317
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,270
I am Roy Mustang.

318
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,100
My rank is Lt. Colonel,

319
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,850
and I am the Flame Alchemist.

320
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,330
Remember that.

321
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,050
He's Mustang...

322
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,090
Brother!

323
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,840
Lt. Colonel!

324
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,350
Why, you... You knew about all of this when you had us board this train, huh?!

325
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,980
It's not as if I had 
a grasp of everything.

326
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,350
More importantly though, I have good news.

327
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,940
His generalship heard 
about your exploits,

328
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,840
and he said he would 
specially allow you

329
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,860
to take the State Alchemist Certification Exam.

330
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,410
Specially?

331
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:08,370
But we came because you told us to take it!

332
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:13,120
There's no way a child could take 
such an important military test, you know.

333
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:19,590
Now, aren't you glad that I had you take this train?

334
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:31,000
Whether or not you take the test is still up to you.

335
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,310
Of course we're going to take it!

336
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,480
We'll take it, all right!

337
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,620
Apparently, those people had us 
dancing right in the palm of their hand.

338
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,350
But then, there was no way around it.

339
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,340
We still don't have any power.

340
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,750
There he is! Over here! Over here!

341
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,180
Marin-chan!

342
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:21,200
Big Brother, thank you!

343
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,900
Thank you!

344
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:35,620
With you always in my sight, I can manage to draw breath

345
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:35,620
itsumo no shisen ni kimi ga ite kokyuu ga dekiru

346
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:43,020
And for me, that ought to be enough in itself, and yet...

347
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:43,020
boku ni totte nara sore dake de mou juubun na hazu na no ni

348
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:50,920
All little old me ever does is repeat the same old mistakes

349
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:50,920
chippoke na boku wa kurikaesu ayamachi bakari

350
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,380
How much strength do I need to come by

351
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,380
dore hodo tsuyosa wo te ni shitara

352
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,350
before I can get by without hurting anything?

353
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,350
nanimo kizutsukezu ni sumu no?

354
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,880
I am not going to stray, I'm going to trust this love,

355
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,880
mayowazu ni kono ai wo,

356
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,690
and with it I will go on living!

357
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,690
shinjikite yuku

358
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,250
I'm going to take these wounds,

359
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,250
fusagaranu

360
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:10,940
the ones that will not close, and squeeze them tight!

361
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:10,940
kizuguchi mo gyutto dakishimete

362
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,200
The two of us must keep on walking,

363
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,200
futari wa arukitsuzukeru

364
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:17,080
The two of us must keep on walking,

365
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:17,080
futari wa arukitsuzukeru

366
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:23,170
since we can never return again

367
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:23,170
ato ni wa modorenai kara

368
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:29,220
Even now, deep within my heart,

369
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:29,220
ima demo kono mune no oku,

370
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:35,170
I still feel the pain of this indelible sin

371
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:35,170
kesenai tsumi wa itamu kedo

372
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:35,430
Darling

373
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,520
Darling

374
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,550

379
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,020
Everyone but me thinks 
it's impossible for Brother to pass.

380
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,950
But then, on that day, 
miraculous flowers will bloom.
