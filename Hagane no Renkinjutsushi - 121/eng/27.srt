1
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,780
Bad news, Brother!

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,180
Ed, do you know him?

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,820
That means...

4
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,430
Where do you think 
you're going, Ed?

5
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,420
I know your every move.

6
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,250
S-Sensei... What are you doing here?

7
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,630
Sensei?

8
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,420
You mean her?

9
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,060
She's our alchemy teacher.

10
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,140
Where's Al?!

11
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,800
Y-Yes, ma'am!

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,140
Oh, I beg your pardon.

13
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,700
Thanks for leading us here, when you must be so busy.

14
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,530
Do you know where Al is as well?

15
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,200
Um, you see...

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,160
I'm Alphonse...

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,890
Ah, is that so? My, my...

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,380
Were you trying to escape by disguising yourself?!

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,310
Stories about you two reach me quite often, my moronic pupils!

20
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,120
Like how you broke away from my teachings

21
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,450
and lowered yourselves to 
become dogs of the military!

22
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,970
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

23
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,560
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

24
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,610
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

25
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:40,990
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

26
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,660
Far away, far away, our dreams will never fade

27
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,660
tooku tooku omoi hatenaku

28
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,960
If only the two of us could go back to

29
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,960
futari ga mujaki ni waratteta

30
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,810
the days when we laughed so innocently

31
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,810
ano koro ni modoreru nara

32
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,910
the days when we laughed so innocently

33
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,910
ano koro ni modoreru nara

34
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,740
Just like glassware

35
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,740
konagona ni kudaketa

36
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:17,340
that has been smashed to pieces,

37
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:17,340
glass-zaiku no you na

38
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:25,130
we're putting together the fragments of our memories

39
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:25,130
omoide no kakera o atsumeteru

40
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,920
It's the important things that you notice

41
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,920
daiji na mono wa itsudatte

42
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,740
It's the important things that you notice

43
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,740
daiji na mono wa itsudatte

44
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:36,490
once you've lost them

45
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:36,490
nakushite kara kizuku yo

46
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,740
Oh, please, oh, please, stop time for me,

47
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,740
douka douka jikan o tomete

48
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:49,320
and engrave the way you look right now into my heart

49
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:49,320
kimi no omokage o kono mune ni kizandekure

50
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,870
And if, and if, I were ever allowed to,

51
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,870
moshimo moshimo yurusareru nara

52
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,280
I would be willing to sacrifice everything

53
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,280
subete o gisei ni shitemo ii

54
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,930
just to see that smiling face one more time

55
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,930
ano egao o mou ichido

56
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,960
Sensei

57
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,960
Sensei

58
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,970
The formal orders for your transfer have come through.

59
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,970
Starting next week, 
you'll be serving in Central, huh?

60
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,390
Yes.

61
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:28,600
We're going to miss you here. You've been quite colorful.

62
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,480
Not at all.

63
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,980
Not as much as when you 
were younger, General. Check.

64
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,040
It's now or never, General.

65
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,990
And here with all of your work, I was able to take it easy.

66
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,990
You have my deepest sympathy.

67
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,990
Checkmate.

68
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,240
I've lost after all, eh?

69
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,150
Your one victory is my parting gift.

70
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,870
I accept it most gratefully.

71
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,840
General...

72
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,950
While you're giving away parting gifts,

73
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,910
I have some subordinates whom 
I would like to take with me to Central.

74
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,750
Mm-hmm, sure.

75
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,180
Take them.

76
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,010
I thank you.

77
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,610
Are you two all right?

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,810
We never expected that Sensei 
would come for us, huh, Brother?

79
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,070
Ow...

80
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,670
Damn...

81
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,450
She even took away 
my silver watch.

82
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,540
I guess we're going 
straight to Dublith.

83
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,150
Still, I'm surprised.

84
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:36,370
I expected your teacher to be someone rougher, not a pretty lady like her.

85
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,750
What are you talking about? 
You've met her before, you know.

86
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,840
It was in Resembool that 
Sensei took us on as her pupils.

87
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,090
In Resembool?

88
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,110
Remember, when we had all that heavy rain?

89
00:04:50,450 --> 00:05:00,190
ECW, 26%; ICW, 34%; 
lipids, 19%; proteins... um...

90
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,130
Wouldn't it be quicker if we just went with the elements composing a human body?

91
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,490
Say, what have you been 
studying so hard about lately?

92
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,360
It's a secret!

93
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,140
It doesn't have anything to do with you, Winry!

94
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,430
You sneaks! You're always 
keeping secrets between you two!

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,210
See you!

96
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,000
We're having stew 
for supper tonight!

97
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,300
Okay! We'll see you later!

98
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,290
Yay!

99
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,860
Whoever invented stew is great!

100
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,580
It's got milk in it, 
but it's still so delicious!

101
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,800
What are you going on about?

102
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,240
The idea of sticking milk into 
vegetable soup was awesome!

103
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,520
Scientists need to change over to that kind of thinking.

104
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,530
There are limits to what we can do 
studying alone, Brother.

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,050
We can't make it on 
our knowledge alone.

106
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,960
Mm-hmm.

107
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:56,350
I wonder what we're missing for human transmutation.

108
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,290
Why is human transmutation forbidden in the first place?

109
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,520
Isn't it because it's a dangerous transmutation that no one has succeeded at?

110
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,850
Remember, they say that a whole country was destroyed in one night...

111
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,550
The story of the Philosopher's Stone in the eastern desert, right?

112
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,870
Right, right. It tells of them 
trying to create a complete human,

113
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,930
but the whole population got dragged into it.

114
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,190
That's just a fairy tale.

115
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,430
His formulas...

116
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,480
If we can make sense of this...

117
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,600
But...

118
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,090
It's written there that human transmutation is forbidden.

119
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,080
I've made up my mind, Al.

120
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,690
We're going to bring 
Mom back to life.

121
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,180
I sure hope the river 
doesn't give way.

122
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,950
Hold it, you two!

123
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,640
We're going to go help!

124
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,920
This is bad. Hey! 
Bring more sandbags here!

125
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,150
Hey, what are you doing?! It's dangerous there!

126
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,920
All right!

127
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,140
I did it!

128
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,610
The transmutation circle!

129
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,070
Brother!

130
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,360
H-Hey!

131
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,560
This is dangerous, 
so please keep back.

132
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,360
That's what I should 
be saying to you!

133
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,050
Get out of there, quickly!

134
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,080
Whoa...

135
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,130
No way!

136
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,590
She didn't even use 
a transmutation circle!

137
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,780
That huge amount of mass, all at once...

138
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,250
That should hold it for a while.

139
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,640
Unbelievable. Who are you?

140
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,350
Just a couple passing through.

141
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,790
Where's the nearest hospital?!

142
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,790
A doctor! Get a doctor!

143
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,280
Hey, stay with us!

144
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:40,330
You really saved us. 
Resembool is in your debt.

145
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,050
Please, let us through.

146
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,120
Pardon us.

147
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,540
Um, Auntie?

148
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,460
Who are you calling your auntie?!

149
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,550
W-We're sorry...

150
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,880
P-Please, take us on as pupils,

151
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,970
Miss.

152
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,220
Pupils?

153
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,850
We're able to use a little alchemy.

154
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,470
We want to become 
better at it, so please!

155
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,800
No way.

156
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,730
Why not?!

157
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,390
I don't take on pupils.

158
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,350
We have a store, so we have to be getting back to Dublith.

159
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,450
Take us with you! Take us as pupils!

160
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,320
Ah! How pesky!

161
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,830
If you do learn alchemy, 
what do you two want to do with it?!

162
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,210
Uh...

163
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,230
We...

164
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,150
We want to be helpful to others!

165
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,640
What about your parents' permission?

166
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,330
Well, about that...

167
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,050
Those two don't have any parents.

168
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,110
I'm the one who 
looks after them now.

169
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,460
I just don't know 
how to handle this.

170
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,240
One month...

171
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,630
Can I take them for 
provisional training?

172
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,670
To see if it's really worth teaching them alchemy.

173
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,640
Please allow me to ascertain 
the talents that these children have.

174
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,680
And if they don't have any talent?

175
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,060
I'll send them right back here.

176
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,810
And if we pass our 
provisional training?

177
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,970
Then we'll proceed to 
full-fledged training.

178
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,280
We won't be coming back in a month!

179
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,260
I knew you'd say that.

180
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,470
Training! Training!

181
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,780
Training! Training!

182
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,800
I'm sure there must be 
a huge laboratory there!

183
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,610
And maybe we can 
read lots of books!

184
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,380
Sure we can! 
It's training, after all!

185
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,290
That's right!

186
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,990
Sensei, you performed an incredible transmutation back there

187
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,800
without even a transmutation circle, huh?

188
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,860
Sensei, by any chance, 
are you a State Alchemist?

189
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,160
Don't you lump me in with those dogs of the military,

190
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,560
who can calmly take 
people's lives if ordered to!

191
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,620
I see.

192
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,460
That person from back then...

193
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,950
I'm loose.

194
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,410
All right!

195
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,410
Let's make a break for it, Al!

196
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,590
Brother!

197
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,460
Looks like you still haven't learned your lesson, huh?

198
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,510
Check.

199
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,550
W-Wait!

200
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,510
I can't wait.

201
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,670
Aw, man!

202
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,670
What's up with that?

203
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,400
I heard it's a style of chess from the eastern island countries.

204
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,230
Yes? Yes, he's here.

205
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,710
That sure was fun 
the other night, huh?

206
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,250
So, about this weekend...

207
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,240
It's okay, it's okay...

208
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:07,840
Ah, hello. I'm a little busy right now...

209
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,660
That's got it fixed.

210
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,950
Thank you so much.

211
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,230
Yes?

212
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,180
I'm asking you,

213
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,690
by all means, 
please include me too!

214
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,190
When you were in the Investigations Department, 
you served under Hughes, right?

215
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,190
Come in.

216
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,310
Master Sergeant Kain Fuery,

217
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,310
Second Lieutenant Heymans Breda,

218
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,430
Second Lieutenant Jean Havoc,

219
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,710
First Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye,

220
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,160
Warrant Officer Vato Falman—

221
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,500
it has been decided that these five will transfer with me to Central.

222
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,510
I will accept no objections.

223
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,600
Come with me!

224
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,150
We didn't get away after all, huh?

225
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,150
Nope...

226
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:20,690
I get chills just thinking about what's going to happen now.

227
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,110
Sensei!

228
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,290
Menny! How is Chico doing?

229
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,940
They say she's about 
to have her babies.

230
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,010
Is that right? 
That'll liven things up, huh?

231
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,370
Izumi-san!

232
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,850
Welcome back!

233
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:36,870
Mason-san!

234
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,630
Huh? Edward-kun, 
it's been too long!

235
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,640
You've really grown a lot!

236
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,730
This is what pisses me off...

237
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,260
Huh? Who is this in the armor?

238
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,010
Er, his younger brother, Alphonse.

239
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,140
You've really grown a lot...

240
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,540
Huh? Aren't you eating?

241
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,960
N-No...

242
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,570
Just eat it.

243
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,020
Okay.

244
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,160
Al-kun, you eat too. 
It's delicious.

245
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,610
I'm already full.

246
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,260
You've had quite a brutal journey, 
haven't you?

247
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,820
You shouldn't be doing such dangerous things.

248
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,720
But it hasn't been all terrible. 
We've also helped people.

249
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,100
That's right, we helped deliver a baby.

250
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,950
Silly, you call that helping? 
All we did is get all flustered.

251
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,830
That's true.

252
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:43,710
But then, the family helps out as the mother risks her life,

253
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:47,110
and everyone is blessed when a person is born.

254
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,930
That's right.

255
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,470
That's the way you guys 
received life, too.

256
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,370
Take pride in the life you have.

257
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:58,080
Now that you mention it, 
Izumi-san, do you have any children?

258
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,670
Hey there, you know, this...

259
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,900
Alchemy! You must've gotten better, right?

260
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,110
Show me something!

261
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,080
Sure, as much as you want. Al...

262
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,420
I'll come too.

263
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,130
Izumi...

264
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,780
Is that so? They watched a life being born, huh?

265
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,380
Those children had themselves a nice experience.

266
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,530
Okay, here goes.

267
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,740
You've gotten good, haven't you?

268
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,370
I'm next.

269
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,850
Sensei, welcome home!

270
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,960
Welcome home!

271
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,300
Sensei, my train is broken.

272
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,920
Fix it.

273
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,280
The axle broke, huh?

274
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,300
Let me have that.

275
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,510
Fix it with alchemy!

276
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:58,230
Nuh-uh. Don't rely on 
alchemy for everything.

277
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,870
Fix whatever you can fix 
by yourself on your own.

278
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,310
There, all done.

279
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,610
Ew, that's ugly.

280
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,030
Well, excuse me.

281
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,380
If you don't want it 
fixed so ungracefully,

282
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,870
be more careful with it 
so it doesn't break.

283
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,660
Sensei, thanks!

284
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,920
I'll be back when I break it again!

285
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,880
<i>Don't</i> break it, I said...

286
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,420
Sensei! Sensei!

287
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,920
What's the matter, Menny?

288
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,930
Chico... It's Chico!

289
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,790
Chico's up there!

290
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,990
I'm going up!

291
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,040
Nice catch!

292
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,310
Chico...

293
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,550
Chico...

294
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,630
Sensei, is Chico broken?

295
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,600
Mm-mm, no. She died.

296
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,350
Sensei, fix Chico!

297
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,950
Izumi-sensei, you can make anything, right?

298
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,640
So, as far as Chico goes...

299
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,860
I can't do that.

300
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,410
A life is different 
from a thing, you see,

301
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,470
and I am not God.

302
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,790
Chico's life has ended, 
and she isn't coming back.

303
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,030
But...

304
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,680
But... up until just a while ago...

305
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,090
I cannot create a life for Chico,

306
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,370
but I can make a grave for her.

307
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,190
When something is alive, 
that life will expire at some point.

308
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,580
The body will return to the earth,

309
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,800
where flowers will bloom on top of it.

310
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,780
Their spirit will serve to nourish other people's feelings

311
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,150
and continue to live on 
inside their hearts.

312
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,020
Everything in the world 
flows around and circulates.

313
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,560
People's lives are like that as well.

314
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,640
Even though I know 
as much about it as I do,

315
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,140
it's still so hard to make 
a child understand death.

316
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,650
Sensei,

317
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,610
have you ever wanted to 
bring someone back to life?

318
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,150
That's the second time 
you've asked that question.

319
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,770
I was only wondering, that's all.

320
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,860
Ouch...

321
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,670
What does that have 
to do with anything?!

322
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,660
The basis of the transmutation circle 
is the power of the circle.

323
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,930
The circle demonstrates the circulation of power,

324
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,200
and through the act of drawing it,

325
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,510
the invoking of that power becomes possible.

326
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:32,840
By knowing the laws and flow of power, you can contend with all things.

327
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,010
Those who would create things after accepting and understanding this—

328
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,570
they are alchemists.

329
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,580
The world constantly follows the motion of a great current.

330
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,100
The death of people 
is part of that flow,

331
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,850
and as such, you must not think about bringing them back to life.

332
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,810
Al, that armor is empty on the inside, isn't it?

333
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,210
Ed's arm and leg are 
Automail as well, right?

334
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,600
H-How did you...

335
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,770
The weight from when I threw you...

336
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,040
your left footsteps sounding 
different from your right ones...

337
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,730
Did you think I wouldn't notice? 
You fools!

338
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,310
Sensei...

339
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,010
Earlier, you did not use 
a transmutation circle, did you?

340
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:24,740
You wouldn't have happened to have seen <i>it</i>, have you?

341
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,450
I have.

342
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:31,960
What happened?

343
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,800
Tell me everything.

344
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,320
Sensei,

345
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,460
I...

346
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,470
We...

347
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,680
transmuted... our mom.

348
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
On the day you left,

349
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
On the day you left,

350
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
kimi ga tabidatsu hi wa

351
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
kimi ga tabidatsu hi wa

352
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,620
I said good-bye and waved, like always

353
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,620
I said good-bye and waved, like always

354
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,620
itsumo to onaji 'jaa ne' to te o futta

355
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,620
itsumo to onaji 'jaa ne' to te o futta

356
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840
Almost as if I would see you again

357
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840
