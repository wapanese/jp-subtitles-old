1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,560
This...

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,210
is Resembool?

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,570
It's awfully...

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,070
I'm sorry it's too rural for you.

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,850
He's still looking.

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,730
What's the matter?

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,680
He's been looking at me 
ever since we were on the train.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,090
You can understand why, right?

9
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,840
It's a crime to be so beautiful.

10
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,840
Um...

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,220
You're Sara, aren't you?

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,810
You sure have grown up.

13
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,430
N-No, I'm not!

14
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,460
For crying out loud, pretending to be someone he knows! That's the oldest...

15
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:55,700
Sara...

16
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,650
That was my mom's name...

17
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,460
What's this? You said you were going to study in Rush Valley,

18
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,300
but you've been in Central this whole time?

19
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,310
It's not like that. We've been keeping an eye on Ed and Al.

20
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,470
You don't say.

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,180
So, when are those two coming back?

22
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,810
Oh, yeah, Grandma, I met someone in Rush Valley who said they knew you.

23
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,860
Grandma, no one's home! 
No one, okay?

24
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,220
Good grief...

25
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,540
Just a moment, please.

26
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,910
Wow, the power of love!

27
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,500
You've come back, have you?

28
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,210
Pinako-san, I can't seem to locate my house.

29
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,180
Your house, as such, is no longer...

30
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,710
Grandma, you know this man?

31
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,720
Ah, right. You were still 
so little, and all.

32
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,480
This man is Ed and Al's father.

33
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,280
Yeah, and coming back 
after being away for so long,

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,980
I can't seem to find my house.

35
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,550
The Philosopher's Stone.

36
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:21,130
Those who obtain it are set free from the Law of Equivalent Exchange.

37
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,030
There is no need to pay a price 
in order to obtain something, either.

38
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,750
We sought it and found it.

39
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,050
The reason I want to spit these creaky old memories out

40
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,050
kishinda omoi o hakidashitai no wa

41
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,830
The reason I want to spit these creaky old memories out

42
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,830
kishinda omoi o hakidashitai no wa

43
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:54,220
is because I don't have any other proof of my existence

44
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:54,220
sonzai no shoumei ga hoka ni nai kara

45
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:59,570
The future that I thought I had grabbed hold of

46
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:59,570
tsukanda hazu no boku no mirai wa

47
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:05,070
is a contradiction of dignity and freedom

48
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:05,070
'songen' to 'jiyuu' de mujun shiteru yo

49
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,670
The reason I want to wipe away this distorted afterimage

50
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,670
yuganda zanzou o keshisaritai no wa

51
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,760
is because I see my own limitations within it

52
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,760
jibun no genkai o soko ni miru kara

53
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,060
is because I see my own limitations within it

54
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,060
jibun no genkai o soko ni miru kara

55
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,420
In the window of my overly self-conscious self

56
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,420
jiishikikajou na boku no mado ni wa

57
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:26,680
is last year's calendar, without any dates written in

58
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:26,680
kyonen no calendar, hizuke ga nai yo

59
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,730
is last year's calendar, without any dates written in

60
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,730
kyonen no calendar, hizuke ga nai yo

61
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:36,650
I'll erase it and rewrite it

62
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:36,650
keshite rewrite shite

63
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,270
with nonsensical surrealism

64
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,270
kudaranai chougensou

65
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,120
and an unforgettable sense of presence

66
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,120
wasurarenu sonzaikan o

67
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,330
Return from the brink of death, and rewrite it

68
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,330
kishikaisei rewrite shite

69
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,030
Even meaningless figments of imagination

70
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,030
imi no nai souzou mo

71
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,230
can be the driving force that gives you form

72
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,230
kimi o nasu gendouryoku

73
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,490
Give your whole body and soul to me

74
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,490
zenshinzenrei o kure yo

75
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,980
The Stray Dog That Ran Away

76
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,980
The Stray Dog That Ran Away

77
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,990
How come you're so fast?

78
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,980
Huh? My body just seems 
awfully light for some reason.

79
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,520
If you're tired, 
should we take a break?

80
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,290
We can't.

81
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,460
What you said before 
was probably the truth.

82
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,840
About Führer Bradley?

83
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,940
That man... the Führer...

84
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,310
is a homunculus!

85
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,230
This time, the Führer was 
commanding the mission.

86
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,180
I don't think it was Envy 
taking his place.

87
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,300
Besides, the Führer's secretary was a homunculus.

88
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,660
If we go back to the military, you and I both would be...

89
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,230
Then, Brother, sure enough, that secretary lady is—

90
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,070
Don't say it!

91
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,790
But Sensei said that homunculi are made when a human transmutation fails.

92
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,290
I told you not to say it!

93
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,890
Al...

94
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,530
What was that just now?

95
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,350
A huge gate... 
I've seen it before, too.

96
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,830
Brother, was that truth?

97
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,410
Sensei said it was 
something else, but yeah.

98
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,870
How did that happen, 
when all we did is touch?

99
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:51,500
As an alchemist, I must have unknowingly made the Philosopher's Stone react.

100
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,160
Brother, do you believe it, then?

101
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,580
That I've become 
a Philosopher's Stone?

102
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,690
I don't feel like that's 
what happened myself.

103
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,220
After all, the Philosopher's Stone 
wouldn't be...

104
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,990
Nobody has ever seen one.

105
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,480
Whatever form it takes, it wouldn't surprise me.

106
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,800
But never mind that. 
Don't get too close to me.

107
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,020
Brother...

108
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,760
If we inadvertently touch again, it will spark another reaction with the Philosopher's Stone.

109
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,410
There's no sense in having you disappear before we can take your body back.

110
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,120
Brother, where are we going?

111
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,490
Resembool.

112
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,800
That's where the military will look first.

113
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,430
Those homunculi are 
sure to come after you.

114
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,590
If we're going to beat them,

115
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,900
there's something 
that we have to get.

116
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:01,380
Kimbly was apparently confirmed dead 
in front of that red light.

117
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,700
However, at that moment, Scar was still alive.

118
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,320
It appears that the townspeople fled outside the city before the military rushed in.

119
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,760
We've discovered an underground passage, and we're tracing where it leads now.

120
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,880
Does this mean they 
weren't trying to resist?

121
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,410
Was their objective

122
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,580
to use the military as ingredients, 
making the whole city a transmutation circle?

123
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,780
Ed and Al appear to be safe.

124
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,420
Several soldiers witnessed Ed outside the city.

125
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,010
They said that about an hour ago, Ed and Al were leaving the area.

126
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,040
Could they be continuing 
on their journey? Even so...

127
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,800
I doubt that they were helping Scar to create a Philosopher's Stone.

128
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,810
Colonel!

129
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,820
28 dead, 67 seriously injured, including five officers.

130
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,820
There are still over 900 others missing.

131
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,390
We will conduct a thorough 
investigation as to what happened.

132
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,120
There is one person who 
knows exactly what happened.

133
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,080
Scar, you mean?

134
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,090
The Fullmetal...

135
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,800
The Elric brothers.

136
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,670
For what reason 
did they show up in Liore?

137
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,010
We believe that 
they were pursuing Scar.

138
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,940
Why? Did he have orders 
to subdue Scar?

139
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,440
No, they were engaged in various 
fields of inquiry and alchemic research.

140
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,440
They appeared in Liore 
and had dealings with Scar.

141
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:33,450
Have as many as a thousand officers 
and men become casualties as a result?

142
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,600
It's not as though he has a rope 
around the Elric brothers' necks.

143
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,660
I would like to give them 
a chance to explain themselves.

144
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:46,620
Are you saying you will 
apprehend them yourself? Very well.

145
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,480
But if you fail to catch them, <i>you</i> will be the one who will have to explain himself.

146
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,330
Go with them.

147
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,430
According to my intelligence,

148
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:08,140
the Elric brothers might be fighting alongside a seditious element that calls themselves homunculi.

149
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,660
Catch him and bring him back.

150
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,160
If it gets out of hand,

151
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,860
I grant you permission to pass judgment on him on the spot.

152
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,620
Colonel...

153
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,920
You heard what he said.

154
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,850
Sort through all the information we have 
on sightings of the Elric brothers.

155
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,910
Are we really going to 
go after Ed and Al?

156
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,420
Those are our orders.

157
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,560
But this was the work of Scar.

158
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,610
It's also partially Archer's fault 
for being reckless.

159
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,180
I don't know what went down here, 
but the brothers—

160
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,920
The fact is, they've run away.

161
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,180
If we let them go, it's going to come down on the Colonel.

162
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,630
He said that if things get out of hand, 
the Colonel was to kill them!

163
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,400
Shall we get going, Colonel?

164
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,130
Yeah.

165
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,160
Did you stay here again 
all last night?

166
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,790
Huh?

167
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:46,600
I just don't have a good grasp on my sense of the passage of time.

168
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,500
How many years has it been 
since Trisha died?

169
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,500
It's been six years now.

170
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,750
I see. The children 
must have grieved, huh?

171
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,170
Sara Rockbell?

172
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,320
But I thought you were Sara.

173
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,280
I told you before, remember?

174
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,230
I'm Winry. 
Sara was my mother.

175
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,420
So that's how.

176
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,440
The war, huh?

177
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,220
It wasn't just war. 
They were killed.

178
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,960
And by a soldier who would ordinarily be their ally.

179
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,030
All because they treated 
friends and foes impartially.

180
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,830
That's so sad.

181
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,310
Please don't make it 
sound so simple.

182
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,400
It's not just sad.

183
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,370
I...

184
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,690
know the man who 
killed my parents.

185
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,340
I also know that he is 
by no means a bad person.

186
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,980
So I can't even do 
anything about it.

187
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,350
That's why...

188
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,550
That's why it's so sad.

189
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,540
Winry-san! I'm so hungry!

190
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,680
L-Lieutenant Ross!

191
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,760
And Brosh!

192
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,300
Gah!

193
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,300
Gah!

194
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:23,340
Gah!

195
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:23,340
Gah!

196
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:23,380
Gah!

197
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:23,380
Gah!

198
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:23,430
Gah!

199
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:23,430
Gah!

200
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,470
Gah!

201
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,470
Gah!

202
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:23,510
Gah!

203
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:23,510
Gah!

204
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:23,550
Gah!

205
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:23,550
Gah!

206
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:23,590
Gah!

207
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:23,590
Gah!

208
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,630
Gah!

209
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,630
Gah!

210
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:23,680
Gah!

211
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:23,680
Gah!

212
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:23,720
Gah!

213
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:23,720
Gah!

214
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:23,760
Gah!

215
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:23,760
Gah!

216
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:23,800
Gah!

217
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:23,800
Gah!

218
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:23,840
Gah!

219
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:23,840
Gah!

220
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:23,880
Gah!

221
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:23,880
Gah!

222
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:23,930
Gah!

223
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:23,930
Gah!

224
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:23,970
Gah!

225
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:23,970
Gah!

226
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:24,010
Gah!

227
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:24,010
Gah!

228
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:24,050
Gah!

229
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:24,050
Gah!

230
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:24,090
Gah!

231
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:24,090
Gah!

232
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:24,130
Gah!

233
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:24,130
Gah!

234
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:24,220
Gah!

235
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:24,220
Gah!

236
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:24,300
Gah!

237
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:24,300
Gah!

238
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:24,340
Gah!

239
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:24,340
Gah!

240
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,590
You really have come after us, haven't you?!

241
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,770
It's because we saw something we weren't supposed to see!

242
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,270
Oh, sure enough, 
you've come after us!

243
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,650
Scieszka!

244
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,530
I never knew.

245
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,680
Those boys don't even have a home anymore.

246
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,900
How do you mean, those two are being pursued by the military?

247
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,250
We got an emergency phone call, 
from the east.

248
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,000
They said that by the Führer's order, we were to apprehend the Fullmetal Alchemist and his brother,

249
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,200
and that they'd been in contact with the masterminds behind the revolt in Liore.

250
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,760
What are those guys doing?

251
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,700
Someone I'm close to in 
Communications told me.

252
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,810
Currently, a search party is being 
drawn up by Major General Hakuro.

253
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,780
Word has probably already gone out to local police.

254
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,590
Once that happened, the Lieutenant suddenly took some leave.

255
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,710
And here I thought 
this would be a date.

256
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,430
It's nice to be able to 
breathe the clean air, isn't it?

257
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,790
How can you go to all this trouble 
just to tell all this to a wanted man?

258
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,320
What are you talking about?!

259
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,690
Even if the Führer <i>did</i> order it, 
I don't believe it!

260
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,530
How could those two be rebels?

261
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,640
Uh, I didn't mean...

262
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,610
Still, we don't know whether or not 
the two of them are even coming here.

263
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,900
No, they'll come home.

264
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,810
Even without a house to return to, 
this is still their home, right?

265
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,050
Besides, you're here, too.

266
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,020
Long ago, there weren't 
any railroads into here.

267
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,970
There wasn't even a single road that went further east, either.

268
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,300
Everyone used to climb the mountain alongside that stream

269
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,280
until it finally let out in the east.

270
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:16,440
We used to play a lot 
by that stream, long ago.

271
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,840
That's it! If I were Ed and Al, 
I would definitely come that way.

272
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,170
Thanks, Uncle!

273
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,500
Un...cle?

274
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,500
Let's go, Scieszka!

275
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,170
Ross-san, you guys stay here!

276
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,490
If the search party shows up, 
we'll slow them down as best we can!

277
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,680
Thank you!

278
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,500
There weren't any 
railroads into here?

279
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,020
But that was over 
a hundred years ago...

280
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,530
Al, hide!

281
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,530
Brother?

282
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,490
Just take cover!

283
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,670
So ultimately, this is all 
just about some promotion?

284
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,590
I wouldn't say that's the only reason.

285
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,060
He said so, didn't he?

286
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,020
If the Elric brothers get away,

287
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,450
the Colonel will bear full responsibility for what happened in Liore.

288
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,180
The Colonel will?

289
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,730
In that case, there isn't much we can do, huh?

290
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,440
H-Hey there, Edward-kun.

291
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,780
Just as the Colonel predicted.

292
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,840
You're taking the side road to your hometown that you're used to taking.

293
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,230
Well, let's go.

294
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,720
Move.

295
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,450
Ed-kun?

296
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,960
I'm never going back to the military!

297
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,160
Go ahead and fire!

298
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,430
See whether or not you can 
shoot through my Automail!

299
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,090
E-Edward-kun, why?

300
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,380
Go ahead and shoot!

301
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Stop!

302
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,140
Havoc-san...

303
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,250
We aren't going back.

304
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,800
Al, let's go!

305
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,780
We're sorry!

306
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,780
Come quietly!

307
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,790
Edward-kun!

308
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,750
If you've got something to say, 
we're all ears!

309
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,820
We aren't your enemy!

310
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,800
You can prove your innocence as much as you want to during the formal inquiry!

311
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,300
You'll be okay for now.

312
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,640
Do those two seriously 
mean to turn against us?

313
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,500
We'll find out 
when we catch them.

314
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,900
Nobody get cold feet next time!

315
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:49,550
Colonel, um, could you 
get into my breast pocket?

316
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,780
Take better care of yourself.

317
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,580
They couldn't have gotten very far.

318
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,790
Probably because they can't very well 
expose Alphonse to the water.

319
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,010
Because of his bloodseal.

320
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,810
Out of the way!

321
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,940
Who was it that told you about the Elric brothers?

322
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,150
Nobody.

323
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,050
Do you seriously think that those two are rebels?

324
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,380
We'll know once we catch them 
and interrogate them.

325
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,880
<i>You're</i> the one who recruited Ed and Al, aren't you?!

326
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,880
And now this?!

327
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,720
It's no use.

328
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,010
The only thing this man is interested in 
is his rank within the military.

329
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,220
Answer me!

330
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,600
Was this how it was when you killed my father and mother, too?!

331
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,700
Brother?

332
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,330
Don't touch me carelessly! 
We don't know what will happen!

333
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,600
Why are you running?!

334
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,610
Ed! Al!

335
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,120
Winry!

336
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,730
Because you're chasing us, that's why.

337
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,950
When a dog is chased, he runs away.

338
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,630
A well-trained dog never 
goes against his master's orders.

339
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,750
Did you say "master"?!

340
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,370
Or, have you suddenly 
gone back to being a stray dog?

341
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,910
Relax, Edward-kun.

342
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,370
Even if you were cursed as a dog of the military,

343
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,880
you would put up with it 
in order to achieve your goal.

344
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,600
Isn't that what you said?

345
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,640
I'm through being 
a dog of the military.

346
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,470
Does this mean you're going back to being 
a helpless child who won't listen to reason?

347
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,730
Call it whatever you want!

348
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,800
You're slipping, Colonel!

349
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,690
Al!

350
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,680
Major!

351
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,680
Sir!

352
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,550
Al!

353
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:04,200
I transmuted the stone projectile in mid-air...

354
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,680
...and I compressed the air within it and ignited it.

355
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,310
An effective attack, was it not?

356
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,810
That must have come in handy 
in Ishbal, huh?

357
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,540
Brother...

358
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,750
Stop!

359
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,440
Please... stop...

360
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,870
Winry...

361
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,950
Once, I killed two people.

362
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,440
They were doctors.

363
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,480
There were no friends or foes 
among their patients.

364
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,750
That's what they said as they treated those around the battlefield.

365
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,550
However, those whom they treated became our enemies.

366
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,270
The military repeatedly asked them 
to stop treating our enemies,

367
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,930
but they refused to listen.

368
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,310
I was given an order... 
and I... shot them.

369
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:38,810
Ever since, I swore that 
even if I were under orders,

370
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,780
I would not follow anything that was unreasonable.

371
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:45,280
That I would put myself in a position where I didn't have to follow them.

372
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:50,940
The reason I'm chasing after you is not because I was ordered to.

373
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,540
It's because I'm pissed off at you!

374
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:58,540
Why did you run off on your own 
without coming to me for protection?!

375
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,220
As my tears well up,

376
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,220
afuredasu namida nara

377
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,390
I don't have to stop them now

378
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,390
ima wa tomenakute ii

379
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:17,710
I don't have to stop them now

380
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:17,710
ima wa tomenakute ii

381
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,500
At the end of all the grief,

382
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,500
kanashimi no saigo ni wa

383
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,380
the light is sure to shine through

384
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,380
hikari ga sashikomu hazu

385
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:33,370
Stay... stay... stay... stay...

386
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:42,680
It's true, I cannot see you now,

387
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:42,680
sou, ima anata ni aenai kedo

388
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,780
but by hiding the heartache,

389
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,780
setsunai omoi kakushite

390
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,900
I can become stronger

391
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,900
tsuyoku nareru,

392
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:58,220
And I will go on making sure of that

393
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:58,220
motto tashikameteyuku no

394
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,730
As my tears well up,

395
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,730
afuredasu namida nara

396
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,460
I don't have to stop them now

397
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,460
ima wa tomenakute ii

398
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,230
Nor will I forget the pain

399
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,230
yasashisa ni kawatteku

400
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,490
as it becomes kindness

401
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,490
itami mo wasurenai

402
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:14,930
as it becomes kindness

403
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:14,930
itami mo wasurenai

404
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:22,630
That which I ruined in my haste,

405
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:22,630
isogisugite kowashitekita mono

406
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,710
I will take back so that

407
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,710
torimodosu no

408
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:33,130
I can walk on as I would

409
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:33,130
watashirashiku aruku tame ni

410
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,860
for you

411
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,450
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

412
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,920
Hohenheim of Light

413
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,870
Hohenheim of Light

414
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,940
Hohenheim of Light

415
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:44,280
Episode 44: "Hohenheim of Light"

416
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,430
What the hell are you doing here...

417
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:50,400
you rotten old man?!
