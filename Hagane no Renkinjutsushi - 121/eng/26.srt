1
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,580
I'm sorry for having called you out.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,390
Here.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,730
It is from Edward Elric.

4
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,380
A bill?

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,680
Hospital charges, 
as well as doctor's fees,

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,350
food expenses while in the hospital, and so on.

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,210
All to be paid for by the 
Eastern Command Center.

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,670
Snack food charges?

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,920
Reading materials charges...

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,640
As well as a large bill 
from a toy store...

11
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,980
Where are they?

12
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,960
They have left on a trip 
to further their objective.

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,980
I believe they will contact us before long, 
so for the time being...

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,480
I asked you where they were!

15
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,240
Colonel...

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,740
Look at this.

17
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,540
Are the Elric brothers here?!

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,500
No, they aren't.

19
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,750
Where have they gone?

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,930
Eh, um, well...

21
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,750
Hey...

22
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,430
Oh! Nice going, dear. Let's go.

23
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,830
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

24
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,430
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

25
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,460
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

26
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:41,990
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

27
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,660
Far away, far away, our dreams will never fade

28
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,660
tooku tooku omoi hatenaku

29
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,960
If only the two of us could go back to

30
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,960
futari ga mujaki ni waratteta

31
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,810
the days when we laughed so innocently

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,810
ano koro ni modoreru nara

33
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:03,910
the days when we laughed so innocently

34
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:03,910
ano koro ni modoreru nara

35
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,740
Just like glassware

36
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,740
konagona ni kudaketa

37
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:18,340
that has been smashed to pieces,

38
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:18,340
glass-zaiku no you na

39
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:26,130
we're putting together the fragments of our memories

40
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:26,130
omoide no kakera o atsumeteru

41
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,920
It's the important things that you notice

42
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,920
daiji na mono wa itsudatte

43
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,740
It's the important things that you notice

44
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,740
daiji na mono wa itsudatte

45
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:37,490
once you've lost them

46
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:37,490
nakushite kara kizuku yo

47
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,740
Oh, please, oh, please, stop time for me,

48
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,740
douka douka jikan o tomete

49
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:50,320
and engrave the way you look right now into my heart

50
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:50,320
kimi no omokage o kono mune ni kizandekure

51
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,870
And if, and if, I were ever allowed to,

00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,870
moshimo moshimo yurusareru nara

53
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,280
I would be willing to sacrifice everything

00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,280
subete o gisei ni shitemo ii

55
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,930
just to see that smiling face one more time

56
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,930

57
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,960
Her Reason

58
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,960
Her Reason

59
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,260
We're finally here! Rush Valley!

60
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,690
How pretty!

61
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,590
That ring is the new model from Studio Remis!

62
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,150
Who would have thought I'd be laying eyes on it in this town?

63
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,740
Buy it, buy it!

64
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,780
You bet, honey!

65
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,280
How pretty!

66
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,950
This Automail is the 1911 Gods' model!

67
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,790
Who would've thought the day would come when I'd be able to behold it!

68
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,040
How nice! I sure would like it!

69
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,590
That sure is nice. 
Let me put it on!

70
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,460
No way.

71
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,290
Why not?

72
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,510
A culverin cannon is 
made for men's ideals.

73
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,270
A girl like you doesn't need one.

74
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:21,280
Well, well, what a shabby little store this is.

75
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,290
Pops, let me have the 
strongest thing you've got.

76
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,530
I've come into some easy money, and I'm going to blow it all!

77
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,480
You don't ignore a customer, you know!

78
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,820
Oh, what's that? Fine little piece, isn't it? 
Stick it on me, would you?

79
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,950
Can't do that.

80
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,060
I only give my Automail to people who really need it.

81
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,970
You what?! I'm a customer here!

82
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,470
You don't need something like this, do you?

83
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,900
Wh-What's with you, 
you nasty old man?

84
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,510
Who needs your broken-down Automail, anyway?

85
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,730
You hack mechanic!

86
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,970
Come on! Come on! It's what Rush Valley is famous for! Automail arm wrestling!

87
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,170
Entrance fee is 10,000 cens! Beat the champion,

88
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,340
and you win all the money collected so far!

89
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,470
Come and take it, you thieves!

90
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,210
Pardon us.

91
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,180
All right! I'll step up to the plate!

92
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,470
Oh, way to go, mister! 
You're sure fired up!

93
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,480
Are you ready?

94
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,190
Ready... Fight!

95
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,260
Huh?

96
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,910
Ready... Fight!

97
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,810
Brother, did you see that just now?

98
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,670
Yeah.

99
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,750
Ready... Fight!

100
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,910
There's nothing they could do, huh?

101
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,840
Little lady, are you sure you're okay with that substandard rig of yours?

102
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,090
Hey, this is crazy! After all, 
she's using that old fart's Automail!

103
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,780
Are you ready?

104
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,800
Ready...

105
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,820
Fight!

106
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,430
Too bad!

107
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,870
If you like, I can introduce you 
to an able craftsman.

108
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,370
So, are there any challengers who want to go next?

109
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,260
Oh!

110
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,320
The strong-looking gentleman there! How about going a round?

111
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,860
Huh, me? No, that's okay.

112
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,000
Is that so? Well, how about the—
or so I thought,

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,710
but calling out such a bean sprout of a boy wouldn't be right of me.

114
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,280
Don't call me a bean sprout!

115
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,210
Ooh, he's got a lot of energy for a bean sprout, huh?

116
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,690
Although, his Automail is awfully shoddy.

117
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,850
Al, let Ed go.

118
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,740
Huh? Okay...

119
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,980
Ed! Don't you dare lose to him!

120
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,050
Okay then, let's go.

121
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,490
Ready...

122
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,570
Fight!

123
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,680
Sorry about that. The scrap collectors are going to be really busy today.

124
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,030
Neener neener!

125
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,760
510,000 cens!

126
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,520
With this much, I can buy 
all of those parts that I wanted!

127
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,190
<i>But...</i>

128
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,990
<i>what I'm really happy about is...</i>

129
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,360
What?

130
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,580
Nothing.

131
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,910
You're the guys who were just...

132
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,350
You really did a number 
on us back there.

133
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,630
Unless you want to get hurt, 
hand over that money quietly!

134
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,880
What's your problem?! 
We beat you fair and square for it!

135
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,470
Shut up! That bean sprout obviously cheated!

136
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,060
What about you?! 
You used alchemy, didn't you?!

137
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,310
You used it too, didn't you?!

138
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,580
Ed, did you use alchemy?

139
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,310
Yeah.

140
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,010
Al, you knew about it?

141
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,410
Hm? Uh-huh.

142
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,450
Is that right?

143
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,400
Ed...

144
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,400
Yeah?

145
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,450
Winry!

146
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,200
Yow-ow-ow...

147
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,490
That hurt! What are you doing, Win—

148
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,960
Brother!

149
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,890
Ed, you dummy!

150
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,980
Colonel,

151
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,090
I've brought Major Armstrong.

152
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,160
To be sure,

153
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,800
there are those whom we suspect were 
the ones who killed the Brigadier General.

154
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,220
In that case, why haven't 
you arrested them at once?

155
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,750
They are suspected, 
but we don't know who they are.

156
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,960
Give me the details.

157
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,210
I cannot.

158
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,960
As a colonel, 
I am instructing you to tell me!

159
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
I cannot say.

160
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,170
That's enough. Go.

161
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,410
That's strange, huh?

162
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,480
No.

163
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,240
He said those whom we suspect 
were the <i>ones</i> who killed Hughes,

164
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,440
which means there was more than one of them.

165
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,500
If he wouldn't answer me, 
even when I ordered him to as a colonel,

166
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,070
it means that someone with a rank higher than mine

167
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,450
has forbidden the Major 
to talk about it.

168
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,310
Furthermore, like Lieutenant Ross said,

169
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,790
since the Elric brothers are taking independent action

170
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,820
without reporting to me first,

171
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,670
we have to consider that the military is involved with the Philosopher's Stone somehow.

172
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,820
That couldn't be...!

173
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:59,050
As it is, we're in the dark.

174
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,400
Winry's nowhere to be found, huh?

175
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,380
Maybe it was a bad idea to use alchemy when you were arm wrestling.

176
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,480
Those guys were cheating, you know.

177
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,130
That may be so...

178
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,510
Did you hurt your arm?

179
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,830
I saw you at the 
arm wrestling competition.

180
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,750
Mind if I sit next to you?

181
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,110
No.

182
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,930
Are your legs Automail, too?

183
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,430
Mm-hmm. 
I'm surprised you could tell.

184
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,460
I'm an artificial-limb outfitter myself.

185
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,720
You hurt your arm, right?

186
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,020
Ah, mm-hmm.

187
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,150
Let me see.

188
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:07,130
Incredible. The working is 
simple yet high-performance.

189
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,850
There's nothing wasted in this design.

190
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,580
There's a load on 
your suspension here.

191
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,170
Looks like you've bent a cylinder.

192
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,320
You can tell that quickly 
just by looking?

193
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,920
Whoever made this 
has incredible skill.

194
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,470
You should have them 
take a look at this right away.

195
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,430
Yeah, I guess you're right.

196
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,050
Say, how did you 
come to have Automail?

197
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,250
I was in a train accident.

198
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,560
And he's the one?

199
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,630
Mm-hmm.

200
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,230
He took me in and even gave me 
an arm and a pair of legs. Dominic-san.

201
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,280
In that case, shouldn't you have him 
fix you up all the more?

202
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,300
I should, I suppose.

203
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,910
Why don't you ask him?

204
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:39,060
I don't want to tell him that 
I lost the arm wrestling contest.

205
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,170
You see, I...

206
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:47,970
I wanted to prove that 
his Automail was amazing.

207
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:48,680
But then...

208
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,550
I know!

209
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:59,780
So then, all you need to do is show that your Automail is amazing, right?

210
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,080
Uh-huh... But how?

211
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,650
You know what? You could show that your Automail is amazing

212
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:10,810
by beating a State Alchemist who also has Automail, couldn't you?

213
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,660
You might be right, but...

214
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,870
Let me take care of that.

215
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,120
Okay.

216
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,380
Paninya, what are you doing there?

217
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,040
D-Dominic-san...

218
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:35,890
S-Sorry to intrude. I'm Winry Rockbell, 
an Automail mechanic from Resembool.

219
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,780
Rockbell from Resembool?!

220
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,610
D-Don't tell me you're Pinako's...!

221
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,110
The leopardess of Resembool!

222
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,220
Just thinking about her horrifies me!

223
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,720
Are you an acquaintance 
of my grandma?

224
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,620
Don't be ridiculous!

225
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,620
What's the matter with your arm?

226
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,120
N-Nothing much.

227
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,120
Do as you will.

228
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:11,480
Jeez, where is that Winry?

229
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,710
I wonder if she slept outside.

230
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,390
Hey!

231
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,330
I finally found you!

232
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,900
You dumb jerk, that's my line!

233
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,360
Sorry! I flew off 
the handle yesterday.

234
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,400
Good morning!

235
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,940
You were there when 
we were arm wrestling...

236
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,530
Her name's Paninya.

237
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,110
I stayed over at 
her house last night.

238
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,490
Is that right?

239
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,490
Say, Ed...

240
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,410
What's up?

241
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,640
Can I take a look at 
your silver watch?

242
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,360
What's this about, 
all of a sudden?

243
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,240
Please?

244
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,500
For the love of...

245
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:45,590
Here.

246
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,970
I'll take this!

247
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,020
What the! Hey!

248
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,600
It's a contest, Ed!

249
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:59,020
If you can get your silver watch back before Paninya takes it to the pawn shop, you win!

250
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,480
Pipsqueak, come on up here!

251
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,570
Hey! Winry!

252
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:11,490
If you don't give chase quickly, you can kiss your watch good-bye, Mr. Alchemist.

253
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,990
Brother!

254
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,620
Winry, why would you 
do such a thing?

255
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,560
I want Ed to say

256
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,830
that her Automail is amazing.

257
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,340
Hold it!

258
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,020
Wait the hell up!

259
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,020
You're hanging in there pretty well, aren't you?

260
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,420
You bet I am!

261
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,710
Just like a cat! Why, you!

262
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,310
How about you use that 
trademark alchemy of yours?

263
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,700
Stop jerking me around!

264
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,150
Uh-oh...

265
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,960
Now, how about 
returning my silver watch?

266
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,220
Take this! My 1.5-inch culverin cannon!

267
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,180
What?!

268
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,040
Maybe they're going too far.

269
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,390
Brother!

270
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,690
I wonder if he's okay.

271
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,900
Let's see... The pawn shop...

272
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:36,910
This is mine!

273
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,370
Why, you!

274
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,430
Yow-ow-ow-ow...

275
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,150
Are you okay?

276
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,350
And I was so close, too...

277
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,100
I don't know what your reasons are,

278
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:08,850
but I can't let anyone beat me 
when it comes to my Automail.

279
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:21,920
Aww! And here, all I wanted to do was show Dominic-san how amazing his Automail is.

280
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,960
It was plenty amazing.

281
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,130
For crying out loud, 
you stupid little girl...

282
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,250
Good day.

283
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,560
I don't need you 
to do that for me.

284
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,960
But...

285
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,090
Listen, your Automail isn't just some device.

286
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,280
They're your very limbs.

287
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,190
And they're yours alone.

288
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,560
I don't remember raising any daughters who weren't aware of such a thing.

289
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,870
I get it.

290
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,660
You make your Automail with the person in mind.

291
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,200
It becomes a part of that 
person's body, doesn't it?

292
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,580
Now that you mention it,

293
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,080
I guess I was glad when I was able to 
stand on my own two feet once again.

294
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,050
Please, Colonel,

295
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:29,090
if you can, locate the criminal who 
did that to Brigadier General Hughes!

296
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,060
I'll do anything!

297
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,930
The investigation concerning his death in the line of duty

298
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,650
has already been suspended.

299
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,820
Which is why I'm asking you, Colonel!

300
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,320
Working hard as usual, eh, Mustang-kun?

301
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,250
It's been too long, General Hakuro.

302
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,330
I heard the rumors that you were being relocated to Central.

303
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,040
However, that doesn't necessarily mean it won't be overruled.

304
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,860
If I could ask for your support, I will serve you to my fullest.

305
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,540
I humbly look forward 
to your guidance.

306
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,100
That's the right attitude.

307
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,350
Excuse me!

308
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,570
I'm heading upward. 
Will you come with me?

309
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,700
You need to ask, 
after all this time?

310
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,250
Well then, if you'll excuse us...

311
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:27,970
Yeah.

312
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,330
Give Winry our best.

313
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,270
Ed, are you asleep?

314
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,500
No.

315
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,610
Say, I noticed earlier that it looks like you've gotten surprisingly taller.

316
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,010
Course I have.

317
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:57,220
Which means that before long, I'll need to get a new arm and leg ready for you.

318
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,300
How about it? Why don't 
we go back to Resembool?

319
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,430
I dunno...

320
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,020
Actually, I'm okay for now.

321
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,040
How come?

322
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,200
Is it that you simply 
don't want Automail?

323
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,800
I'll do my best.

324
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,750
I'll study harder and harder,

325
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,800
to keep you from being handicapped for the rest of your life.

326
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,280
So...

327
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,720
So please...

328
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,560
Winry...

329
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,570
Even so,

330
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,600
we want to get our bodies back.

331
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,500
It's something we have 
to do for ourselves.

332
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,130
Bad news, Brother!

333
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
On the day you left,

334
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
On the day you left,

335
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330

336
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330

341
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840
Almost as if I would see you again

342
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840
Almost as if I would see you again

343
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840
