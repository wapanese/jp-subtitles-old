1
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,410
I had my girlfriend 
bake some apple pie.

2
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,710
Want some?

3
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,130
Roy...

4
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,380
As you can see,

5
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,030
this is that which is forbidden.

6
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,210
I may not know alchemy,

7
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,480
but I do know one thing!

8
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,850
Those who commit 
that which is forbidden...

9
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,080
Don't worry.

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,820
I haven't done a thing.

11
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,910
But you were planning to try?

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,320
So many died—

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,490
I mean, I killed them.

14
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,870
It was war.

15
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,450
You weren't there.

16
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,960
Oh, right. If you couldn't stand 
going to war and killing the enemy,

17
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,160
you should have chosen 
duty at the rear, like I did.

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,840
By becoming a State Alchemist

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,040
and then calling even some of 
those people back to this world,

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,760
did you think it would save you?!

21
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:18,850
Good question.

22
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,770
Is performing the forbidden so straightforward

23
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,850
that you can just cram for it 
to be able to pull it off?!

24
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,790
Or did you just want to die?

25
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,610
If that's the case, there are easier ways to go about it.

26
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,820
As it turns out, I was unable to attempt it, 
out of fear for my own life.

27
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,130
Of course you couldn't.

28
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,680
That's just the kind of person I am.

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,120
That's true about anyone.

30
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,630
However, there is a better way to use the life I have than this.

31
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,710
Maes,

32
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,210
I've made up my mind.

33
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,060
Tell me more, Roy.

34
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:00,680
Lt. Colonel?

35
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,930
Um, Lt. Colonel?

36
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,170
It's okay. I'll wait.

37
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,940
Führer!

38
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,900
You seem to be investigating 
the higher levels of the military, huh?

39
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,660
Y-Yes, in regards to the 5th Laboratory.

40
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,400
Regarding that matter,

41
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,090
I took charge of it personally and concluded it's possible that Brig. Gen. Basque Grand

42
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:32,070
teamed up with Ishbalan radicals in conducting seditious research.

43
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,380
Are you dissatisfied with that?

44
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,670
Well, I, uh... Yes.

45
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,300
Oh, is this about 
the Philosopher's Stone?

46
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,700
Yes. It can be surmised that within the military,

47
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,140
there was experimentation with creating Philosopher's Stones

48
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,690
and that there were various 
illegal actions taken to that end.

49
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,900
And it was not all carried out 
at Brig. Gen. Grand's discretion.

50
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,670
At the very least,

51
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,880
this also falls upon the succession of superior officers over Doctor Marcoh.

52
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,910
It's possible that these 
persons were complicit.

53
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,910
Major generals, 
brigadier generals, colonels...

54
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,860
Involved in something like this?

55
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:12,540
Yes. In just the last year, each one has either died or gone missing.

56
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,380
However, when you consider that 
the 5th Laboratory was still operating

57
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,230
and that just the other day, 
Ishbalan refugees were attacked

58
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:24,050
by someone within the military who employed mercenaries...

59
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,450
You're saying that even now, 
some power within the military

60
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,770
is attempting to create a Philosopher's Stone?

61
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,030
If something like that 
ever came to light,

62
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,130
the military would lose its authority!

63
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,030
I'm joking! Follow through on it.

64
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,750
After all, someone has been conducting prohibited, top-secret human experimentation

65
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,300
and then using assassins who call themselves homunculi to wipe out the evidence.

66
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,670
I cannot overlook such an outrage.

67
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,460
We will purge this corruption.

68
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,420
Thank you very much.

69
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,360
As such, Führer...

70
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,830
Mm, Doctor Marcoh, right?

71
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,130
I'd like to question him for information again.

72
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,300
Juliet...

73
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,310
I will ask that he be brought to Central immediately.

74
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,810
The truth is, she's the only one who knows where Marcoh is hiding.

75
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:18,460
It's a precaution to prevent me from revealing anything, even if tortured by the enemy.

76
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,820
Very well, if you please...

77
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,530
uh... Douglas-san.

78
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,350
We will purge this corruption.

79
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,910
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

80
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,510
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

81
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,540
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

82
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:48,970
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

83
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,110
Ready, steady, can't hold me back

84
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,460
Ready, steady, give me good luck

85
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,760
Ready, steady, never look back

86
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,160
Let's get started, ready, steady, go!

87
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,310

Please, trust me!

Words of Farewell

126
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:22,940
Words of Farewell

127
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,440
In other words,

128
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,990
this means that all the bigwigs who are connected with the 5th Laboratory

129
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,930
either die or turn up missing?

130
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,910
And there weren't any criminals on the list who had the Uroboros mark on them.

131
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,960
It sounds like they're talking about some scary stuff.

132
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,920
I don't want to stick my nose into any more trouble.

133
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,670
Well, there should still be scientists who worked under Doctor Marcoh.

134
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:51,000
If we could find some of them...

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,060
Well, leave that to me.

136
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,280
Um, about that...

137
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,310
It's like it doesn't 
really matter anymore.

138
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,030
What are you guys talking about?!

139
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,260
We're saying,

140
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,320
we've had enough of the Philosopher's Stone and homunculi and other dicey stuff like that.

141
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,410
And that maybe, it would be smarter to look for a different method.

142
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,550
That would definitely be smarter.

143
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,990
But if you could find it that simply, there wouldn't be any sport in it.

144
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,050
There <i>is</i> one person who might know something about it.

145
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,750
Our teacher.

146
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,720
She lives to the south, 
in a place called Dublith.

147
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,720
We plan on paying her a visit.

148
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,480
Elric brothers...

149
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,470
Here, just one stop before Dublith!

150
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,540
Is there something there?

151
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,470
It's the holy land of 
Automail mechanics, Rush Valley!

152
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,430
I've always wanted to go there!

153
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,980
Take me with you! Take me with you! Take me with you! Take me with you!

154
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,500
Go there by yourself.

155
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,350
But who's going to pay 
my traveling expenses?

156
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,440
You're trying to mooch off of us?!

157
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,310
It's okay, isn't it? 
It's on the way, and all.

158
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,000
What's the use?

159
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,440
Yay!

160
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,420
So those two have finally decided not to get involved in any more dangerous business, huh?

161
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,760
They must have realized how hard it was for us to guard them.

162
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,760
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

163
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,620
If that were the case, 
what fun would that be?

164
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,840
This is all to keep us from 
becoming the next victims.

165
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,580
Pretty sharp for a kid.

166
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,820
You're not going to Dublith?!

167
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,720
But we <i>are</i> going as far as Rush Valley.

168
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,410
In that case, okay. 
But why not?

169
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,370
Weren't you going to ask your teacher

170
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,580
about other methods besides the Philosopher's Stone?

171
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,910
If we did that, we'd be killed.

172
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,010
Killed?

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,110
Teacher

174
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,110
Teacher

175
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,230

00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,230
Teacher

177
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:51,360
Teacher

178
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:51,360
Teacher

179
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:51,440
Teacher

180
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:51,440
Teacher

181
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:51,530
Teacher

182
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:51,530
Teacher

183
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:51,610
Teacher

184
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:51,610
Teacher

185
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:51,690
Teacher

186
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:51,690
Teacher

187
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,560
We never told our teacher about becoming State Alchemists.

188
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,880
Not to mention that if it got out that 
we had performed human transmutation...

189
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,900
I'd like to live a little bit longer.

190
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,690
I would at least like to have fallen in love, Brother.

191
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,190
And even if that weren't the case,

192
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,070
I get the feeling we shouldn't ask our teacher about this.

193
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,120
So, what are you going to do?

194
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:22,200
There's a large-scale Ishbalan camp in the mountains to the south.

195
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,920
I'm guessing that Scar and 
the others are headed there.

196
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,210
You're going after Scar?

197
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,780
It's said that a Philosopher's Stone was once created at Ishbal.

198
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,190
But since they never had alchemy introduced to them in the first place,

199
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,680
we think it might be possible that they 
created it in a completely different manner.

200
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:44,920
I'm going to pound on him 
and make him tell us the secret.

201
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,180
Now, Brother, he really isn't that bad a person.

202
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,080
He's a killer.

203
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,030
And he uses alchemy to do it.

204
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,530
I can't let him 
get away with that.

205
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,620
Brother! Master!

206
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,100
Hey.

207
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,860
Who are you?! You are not of the people of Ishbal, are you?

208
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,860
Oh, how rude of me.

209
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,400
I've failed to introduce myself.

210
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,530
I'm the State Alchemist in charge of exterminating this region.

211
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,680
You've got a visitor!

212
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,580
Master!

213
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm so glad you are safe.

214
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,670
I'm impressed that 
you survived as well.

215
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,020
Where have you been up to now?

216
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,480
There are a certain number of us 
living in the mountains to the south.

217
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,730
We were planning on 
visiting there ourselves.

218
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:23,040
Our countrymen who were in Central were coming to meet us,

219
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,780
traveling so as not to catch the military's attention,

220
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,480
when along the way, 
they heard stories about you.

221
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,460
In these last three years,

222
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,880
they say you've been going around killing State Alchemists.

223
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:41,790
It was State Alchemists who burned down our villages.

224
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,890
I can understand your 
feelings of resentment.

225
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,250
It's true!

226
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,800
These guys are Ishbalans, aren't they?

227
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,400
Are you sure it's safe to be 
hanging around in a place like this?

228
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,480
Aren't you guys supposed to be living in the designated camps?

229
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:11,110
But what you are doing is taking out 
your anger in sworn vengeance, is it not?

230
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,430
Vengeance only sows the seeds of renewed vengeance.

231
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,050
In the ancient words of Ishbala, it says:

232
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,580
"Those who receive pain can still sleep."

233
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,060
"Those who give pain cannot sleep."

234
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,720
That arm of yours...

235
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,430
Is that your brother's arm?

236
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,440
Why didn't you report to me that the 
Elric brothers had been put in a hospital?

237
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,500
Huh? Didn't I mention that? Well, it's no big deal.

238
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,180
Never mind them,

239
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,180
No big deal?!

240
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,250
it sounds like your posting to Central is going to be formally settled on.

241
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,830
Hurry up and make yourself important

242
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,580
so you can make things easier for the rest of us.

243
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,700
And find yourself a wife!

244
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,990
Be gentle with the telephone.

245
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,950
Lieutenant, get us a train.

246
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,170
To Central?

247
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,260
Something is going on.

248
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,680
Mustang-san is just 
worried about those two.

249
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,840
There's no need to 
worry him unnecessarily,

250
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,050
nor does he need to know 
about any of the nonsense.

251
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:54,060
For one thing, it's possible that our phones are being tapped.

252
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,500
Sorry, but I still have 
things to look into.

253
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,550
Okay, be careful.

254
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:03,570
Papa still has lots of work to do. 
I'll be back later.

255
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,110
Bring me the materials 
on the Liore riots!

256
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,860
Right!

257
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,370
Where are the diagrams of the 
transmutation circles from the 5th Laboratory?!

258
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,970
The budget from the first year of the Ishbal Rebellion!

259
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,340
Am I going to get 
overtime pay for this?

260
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,230
I'll give you a picture of Elicia!

261
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:33,080
Ishbal... Liore... Mugear's mines...

262
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,680
Once they got near a Philosopher's Stone, 
they were destroyed.

263
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,620
Strange, isn't it?

264
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,790
If they're driving people to 
create a Philosopher's Stone,

265
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,410
why would they spread stories around

266
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,190
that destruction befalls those who seek the Philosopher's Stone?

267
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,510
Is it to get rid of all the evidence?

268
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,830
No... It couldn't be...

269
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,040
just the opposite, could it?

270
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,540
Supposing everything was reversed...

271
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:03,540
Hold on... The unit that caused 
the outbreak of war in Ishbal was...

272
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,040
...Douglas? Where have 
I heard that name before?

273
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,840
Um, there's a phone call 
from the Führer's secretary.

274
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,910
Yes, Doctor Marcoh has arrived in Central.

275
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,350
He is waiting at the hotel.

276
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,370
Thank you very much. 
I will go see him right away.

277
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,830
Douglas... Juliet...

278
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:30,320
Scieszka! Put all of these materials back where you found them!

279
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,450
Once that's done, you can go home! 
Also, you're fired!

280
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,830
Don't ever come around here again.

281
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,330
Sorry to put you 
through all this trouble.

282
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,300
Ms. Secretary... Douglas-san,

283
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,850
do you know much 
about the Ishbalan War?

284
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,810
No, I have always had desk jobs.

285
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,090
So have I, you know?

286
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,700
I've been looking into 
some things lately.

287
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,780
Did you know that the reason the rebellion broke out

288
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:03,310
was that one of the soldiers stationed there recklessly shot and killed an Ishbalan child?

289
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:07,560
That soldier's name, 
it turns out, was Juliet Douglas.

290
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,320
It's a common name.

291
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,390
That's where it gets interesting. The soldier with that name

292
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:18,200
was supposed to have died two years before the Ishbal Rebellion.

293
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,920
That is odd.

294
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,210
There's one other "odd" thing.

295
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:25,000
Douglas was dead before then.

296
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,210
And yet the muster roll for this person 
named Juliet Douglas was never withdrawn.

297
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,640
On the contrary, 
over the last two years,

298
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,220
the soldier with that name 
has been suddenly promoted.

299
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,970
And now, she has been promoted to the Führer's Ministerial Secretary?

300
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,480
Who are you?

301
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,620
Were you at Ishbal?

302
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:51,130
Or did you just use Douglas's 
registration to get into the military?

303
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,820
The Doctor is waiting.

304
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,530
Is that even Marcoh 
behind that door?

305
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,000
Nice to meet you.

306
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,420
Or perhaps, "farewell" 
might be more appropriate.

307
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,170
That's a cool tattoo 
you've got there, sweetheart.

308
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,010
Lt. Colonel!

309
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,020
That was unexpectedly skillful, huh?

310
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,730
Sloth, make sure to let everyone know.

311
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,550
Lieutenant Ross, 
they're right next to the Führer!

312
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,240
The enemy has fully infiltrated the military. Their purpose...

313
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,160
is not to create a Philosopher's Stone.

314
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,240
No...

315
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,180
Come with me.

316
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,250
Yes, sir.

317
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,980
Ah, dammit...

318
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,550
Jeez, what a pain...

319
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,880
What? He's not there?!

320
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,580
He left for Central with Lieutenant Hawkeye.

321
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,010
Has something happened?

322
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,760
With this information,

323
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,280
he had a chance to rise 
right to the top!

324
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,730
In any event, we should get to someplace safe.

325
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,730
You're right. It's not as though 
I've got nothing left to hang onto.

326
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,440
Why don't you 
tell me all about it?

327
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,080
The Lieutenant has a mole under one of her eyes.

328
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,870
Is that right?

329
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,990
I must have gotten careless.

330
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,660
That's amazing.

331
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,070
Forgive me.

332
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:46,080
I have a wife and daughter waiting for me at home.

333
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,640
That was a pretty good act, 
wasn't it, Lt. Colonel Hughes?

334
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,400
I'm going to become the Führer.

335
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,520
I'm going to change 
the way this country runs.

336
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,130
That's the only thing I can do.

337
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:24,010
Then you'll need someone who 
understands you and can support you.

338
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,700
Someone underneath you, who can push you upward.

339
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,780
Mama, why? Why are they burying Papa?

340
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:29,810
Huh? Why are those men burying Papa?

341
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:30,970
Why?

342
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,000
Elicia...

343
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,530
I don't want them to.

344
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,810
I don't want them to!

345
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:39,880
If they do that, then Papa 
can't do his work anymore!

346
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,760
Mama, stop them!

347
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,470
Elicia...

348
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,900
Papa said he still had 
a lot of work to do!

349
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,580
I don't want them to!

350
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,940
Don't bury him! Mama!

351
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,970
Papa! Papa!

352
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,160
Killed in the line of duty and 
posthumously promoted two ranks...

353
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,210
Brigadier General Hughes, huh?

354
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:20,790
What am I going to do 
now that the man who said

355
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:24,630
he would stay beneath me and assist me 
has gone above me, you idiot?

356
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,490
Colonel...

357
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:32,640
Once, I tried putting together a theory 
on how to perform human transmutation.

358
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:36,800
Just now, I was frantically remembering it.

359
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,900
We alchemists are nasty creatures.

360
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,070
If the Elric brothers 
were mixed up in this,

361
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,830
why didn't he report it to me?

362
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,820
He didn't have to go 
charging into this alone.

363
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,910
Haven't you figured it out yet?

364
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,340
Figured what out?

365
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,180
When it comes to those brothers,

366
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,280
the Colonel has been known to 
lose his level-headed judgment.

367
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,740
And so, Brigadier General Hughes

368
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,790
took everything concerning 
the Elric brothers upon himself,

369
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,590
so that the Colonel could relax

370
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,890
and set his sights above himself.

371
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,810
It's starting to rain, huh?

372
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,330
Yes.

373
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,790
I wonder if this is like the food that Mom used to make.

374
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:47,800
Hughes-san, his wife, and Elicia-chan were all such fine people.

375
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,740
Uh-huh.

376
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,130
Lt. Colonel Hughes is a mother hen and a busybody. He bothers me.

377
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,580
He always used to come to joke around with us, huh?

378
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,400
Every day, he said 
he was busy with work,

379
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,690
but he still always 
came by to check on us.

380
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,690
I wonder why he looked after us 
as much as he did.

381
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,060
Who knows?

382
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,200
When we get back to Central, make sure you thank him.

383
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,610
Ed?

384
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,220
Is something the matter, Brother?

385
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,050
Nope.

386
00:24:12,430 --> 00:25:26,270
m 0 110 l 940 110 940 300 0 300

387
00:24:12,430 --> 00:25:26,270
m 0 -20 l 940 -20 940 90 0 90

388
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:18,120
You squeeze your right hand, as if to reassure yourself

389
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:18,120
tashikameru you ni nigirishimeta migite

390
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,970
Go on, take those annoying rules and dash them away!

391
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,970
uzattai housoku o buchikowashite yuke

392
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,110
If it comes down to having to rest your wounded feet,

393
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,110
kizutsuita ashi o yasumaseru gurai nara

394
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:33,000
you've gotta keep moving forward, if only just a step!

395
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:33,000
tatta ippo demo koko kara susume

396
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:37,770
We've pushed our way through the twisting winds

397
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:37,770
yuganda kaze o kaki wakete

398
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:42,900
and gotten beyond the cold sky

399
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:42,900
tsumetai sora o oikoshite

400
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:49,670
Yet we still continue to wander

401
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:49,670
soredemo mada samayoi tsuzuketeru

402
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:57,840
We always find ourselves crying out

403
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:57,840
bokura wa itsudemo sakenderu

404
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,180
Just continuing to believe is not the answer

405
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,180
shinji tsuzukeru dake ga kotae janai

406
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:07,890
We must bare our weaknesses and wounds,

407
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:07,890
yowasa mo kizu mo sarake dashite

408
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:12,570
and continue to struggle, or nothing will ever turn out!

409
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:12,570
mogaki tsuzukenakereba hajimaranai

410
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:20,270
Break on through to the other side of the door!

411
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:20,270
tsukiyabure tobira no mukou e

412
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:26,020
To the other side of the door!

413
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:26,020
tobira no mukou e

414
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,450
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

415
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,900
Her Reason

416
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,850
Her Reason

417
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,920
Her Reason

418
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,920
Episode 26: "Her Reason"

419
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,430
I never even thought about it.

420
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,600
Could there be somebody 
who felt that way about me?
