1
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,930
This is going to be quite a chore to find just one book.

2
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,250
She couldn't be...

3
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,010
Who's there?

4
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,300
What do you want, scarred man?

5
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,210
You look like her. 
But there's no way you could be...

6
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,330
I smell something, I smell something.

7
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,060
It's the smell of an Ishbalan, covered with blood.

8
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,070
You intend to involve yourself with 
the Fullmetal pipsqueak, don't you?

9
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,200
We can't have that.

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,830
We still need the boy to pursue the Philosopher's Stone.

11
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:02,950
What are you talking about?

12
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,960
Oh dear, perhaps I said too much.

13
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,040
Can I eat this one too?

14
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,830
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

15
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,420
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

16
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,460
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

17
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,990
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

18
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,130
Ready, steady, can't hold me back

19
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,480
Ready, steady, give me good luck

20
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,780
Ready, steady, never look back

21
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,180
Let's get started, ready, steady, go!

22
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,330
The landscape blows on by me

Marcoh's Notes

62
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,470
We're here! Central!

63
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,040
Phew! How about we head for the first branch right away?

64
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,500
Brother, hold on!

65
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,230
You don't need to hurry. 
The library isn't going to run off!

66
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,690
We've finally got a definite lead!

67
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,910
I can't just sit still now!

68
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,440
Major Armstrong, 
we have come to greet you.

69
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,180
Well done.

70
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,740
I will be proceeding directly to the command center,

71
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,830
so you will be in charge of 
guarding these two from now on.

72
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,830
Lieutenant Maria Ross!

73
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,040
Sergeant Denny Brosh!

74
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,440
It's an honor to meet you, Fullmetal Alchemist.

75
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,100
Wow, you're dressed just as your second name implies!

76
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,430
You do indeed wear it with dignity.

77
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,450
This happens all the time.

78
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,620
Eh, I'm used to it.

79
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,930
Then it's this little fellowâ€”

80
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,250
N-No, I meant...

81
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,310
I didn't think you were 
going to be a child like this...

82
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,980
Aah, enough already!

83
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,670
Major! We don't need any guards!

84
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,230
The two of us are both 
perfectly put back together!

85
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,010
I really would like to 
let you go as well, but...

86
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,870
We have received information that Scar has appeared again in Central.

87
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,630
That's right.

88
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,710
Just put up with it for now.

89
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,730
Fullmetal Alchemist,

90
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,490
please leave everything to us!

91
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,380
I just hope you don't 
slow me down.

92
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,430
Ah, we have a car waiting!

93
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,880
I apologize.

94
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,530
He's always like that. 
Please don't let it bother you.

95
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,770
Despite how he appears, he has 
overcome a bitter past many times...

96
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,680
Please overlook his behavior for me.

97
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,650
R-Right... 
But actually, as it happens...

98
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:08,100
Last night, the first branch was all but 
completely lost due to a fire that broke out.

99
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,450
You're kidding me, right?

100
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,510
According to eyewitness reports,

101
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,870
we suspect that it was the act of Scar, 
who is on our wanted list.

102
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,460
Brother...

103
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,470
Our lead is burned to a crisp...

104
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,470
Central Command Center

105
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,470
Central Command Center

106
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,340
Really! Seriously, seriously! I want you to hear her too!

107
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,560
She's a prodigy! 
And she's only three years old!

108
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,520
She has an angelic singing voice!

109
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,150
Eastern Command Center

110
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,150
Eastern Command Center

111
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,150
That settles it! 
She's going to be a future songstress!

112
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,010
Lieutenant Colonel, I'm working here.

113
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,280
Huh? Fancy that! I'm working too!

114
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,940
Jeez...

115
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,490
I wonder if there is any alchemy that can burn someone up on the other end of the phone.

116
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,600
You say such frightening things, 
Flame Alchemist.

117
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,000
Now then, about that other matter...

118
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,710
According to eyewitness testimony, 
we're certain that Scar was involved.

119
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,840
However, looking at the site, I can't 
believe it was the work of him alone.

120
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,060
There is evidence that he was fighting with someone.

121
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,430
Any news on Scar?

122
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:16,560
Signs of fighting continue on away from the building site into the sewers.

123
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:21,180
We discovered his bloodstained clothes further downstream,

124
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,770
but we're not sure 
if he's alive or dead.

125
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,330
Right now in Central, following the death of Brigadier General Grand,

126
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,280
there are plausible rumors going around that Colonel Mustang will be returning.

127
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,060
Then again, there are others that are putting forward the misdirected notion

128
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,300
that you're the one 
behind the disturbances.

129
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,620
Hm, how ridiculous. But then...

130
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,430
Returning to Central, huh?

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,380
That doesn't sound bad.

132
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,880
Watch yourself. You've got a lot of enemies among the higher-ups right now.

133
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,380
I'm ready for them.

134
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:54,360
Make as many friends as you can, 
who understand you and will support you.

135
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,510
Which means,

136
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,960
as soon as you can...

137
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,670
find yourself a wife!

138
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,490
Shut up!

139
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,560
Colonel, take it easy on the phone.

140
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,480
Lieutenant Colonel! Don't sit up there!

141
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,070
Central Library

142
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,070
Central Library

143
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,070
We've been searching 
since this morning,

144
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,370
but these are the only books we were able to recover.

145
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,660
This is terrible.

146
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,980
Brother...

147
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,250
Sure enough, there aren't any books 
authored by Tim Marcoh in the main building.

148
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,900
If they had been moved there 
from the branch,

149
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,140
there should be 
a record of it, after all.

150
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,880
Um, is there any possibility that it was checked out by anyone?

151
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,180
Yes, but since the circulation records were also burned up...

152
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,110
I see...

153
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,830
It was probably burned up 
together with all the others.

154
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:45,040
If only we could have confirmed that his book was really even in there...

155
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,780
Was there anyone else 
who worked there?

156
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,490
He and I were the only people on staff in that branch.

157
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,970
Just you two?

158
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,620
Only State Alchemists were 
permitted in the branch, and all.

159
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,710
I think I remember there being 
a young lady there who wore glasses.

160
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,630
Ah, you mean Scieszka?

161
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,880
She was fired a little while back.

162
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,630
Fired?

163
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,170
That girl was a little unusual.

164
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,010
Scieszka was a bookworm.

165
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,510
Worm?

166
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,120
I guess she isn't home.

167
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,230
The lights are on. Let's open it!

168
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,140
You can't!

169
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,250
What a mountain of books!

170
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,070
Does someone actually live here?

171
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,820
Scieszka-san, are you here?

172
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,030
Scieszka-san!

173
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,980
She's not here.

174
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:46,380
Help! Help!

175
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,600
There's someone... 
There's someone buried here!

176
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,760
Dig! Dig! Just keep digging!

177
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,380
Thank you very much.

178
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,940
I inadvertently knocked over 
that pile of books.

179
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,730
I couldn't breathe, 
and I thought I was going to die.

180
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,570
Scieszka-san, you used to work at the first branch, right?

181
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:18,070
Yes. All I ever did was read books while I was working, so I got fired.

182
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,840
I have to support my sick mother,

183
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,240
but I'm just no good at anything besides reading books.

184
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,380
Um, anyhow, Scieszka-san, 
do you remember there being a book

185
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,210
authored by someone named Tim Marcoh at the branch?

186
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,550
Tim Marcoh?

187
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,720
It would probably be a thick, 
handwritten research journal.

188
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,890
A thick, handwritten research journal... 
by Tim Marcoh...

189
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,830
Yes, I remember!

190
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,610
It was a leather-bound book, 
with handwritten manuscripts inside.

191
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,340
Are you sure about that?

192
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,040
Yes. I remember all of the books in the branch's collection.

193
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,120
Which would mean, sure enough...

194
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,330
Damn. We're right back 
where we started.

195
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,080
Brother...

196
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,100
Yes, indeed.

197
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,420
It sure is sad when you can't find a book you want to read.

198
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,390
I know that feeling terribly well.

199
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:23,910
Delusion

200
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:23,910
Reality

201
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:20,050
I, too, once wandered among this mountain of books for nearly three days,

202
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,180
but I still did not find the 
one volume I wanted to read.

203
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,140
It's so, so sad...

204
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,020
S-Scieszka-san, thanks.

205
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,600
With your help, we at least 
confirmed that the book existed.

206
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,590
We'll manage to do 
something from here on.

207
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,160
You mean, there's still 
some other way?

208
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm going to transmute the cinders of all the burned books back to their original form!

209
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,120
Incredible! Can you really do something like that?

210
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,710
Watch closely!

211
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,800
Uh, what about that?

212
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,660
Is it okay for that stuff 
to go flying off?

213
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,340
No matter how hard you try, it'll be impossible, Brother.

214
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,810
Um, if you would like, 
shall I reproduce the book for you?

215
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:14,020
I remember the entire contents of a book once I read it.

216
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,030
And since I've read most of the books in the branch...

217
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:20,360
You mean it? 
Can you really do that?!

218
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,300
It's a silly little talent I have, but if I can help you out...

219
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:25,010
Three Days Later

220
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:25,010
Three Days Later

221
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:25,050
Three Days Later

222
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:25,050
Three Days Later

223
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:25,100
Three Days Later

224
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:25,100
Three Days Later

225
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,140
Three Days Later

226
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,140
Three Days Later

227
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,180
Three Days Later

228
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,180
Three Days Later

229
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,220
Three Days Later

230
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,220
Three Days Later

231
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,260
Three Days Later

232
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,260
Three Days Later

233
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,120
Three Days Later

234
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,120
Three Days Later

235
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,720
Here you go! 
There was a lot of content,

236
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,210
so it took me three whole days 
to write it all down.

237
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,710
This is Marcoh-san's 
research journal? Really?

238
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,840
Yes!

239
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,470
Everything from light and easy <i>hors d'oeuvres</i>, 
to party dinners you'd invite guests to.

240
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,850
Tim Marcoh's "1,000 Recipes for Today's Menus"!

241
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,080
Right?

242
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,940
One tablespoon of sugar, 
a pinch of salt and pepper...

243
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,010
This really is today's menu.

244
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,610
Are you sure you didn't get the wrong author?

245
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,220
You're not serious! All I did was reproduce what I was told to.

246
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,540
It was all in vain, I'm sorry to say.

247
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,790
No...

248
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:16,290
You're sure that, word for word, this is 
the same thing that Marcoh-san wrote?

249
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,530
Yes, no doubt about it.

250
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,070
You're incredible! Thanks!

251
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:21,760
Lt. Ross!

252
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,820
Give Scieszka this amount of money for me.

253
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,770
If you go to State Alchemist Services with my references there,

254
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,900
they'll take it out of my 
research budget for you.

255
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,270
Al, let's go!

256
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,750
Hold on!

257
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,930
Sergeant, here.

258
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,010
What is he planning to do with a book like that?

259
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,370
Indeed...

260
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:51,000
Th-That much?!

261
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,500
For him to pay out 
this amount all at once,

262
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,900
he sure is a State Alchemist!

263
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,500
Wait, please! 
Where are you going?

264
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,800
We're going to hole up in the Central Library for a while.

265
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,510
They have abundant materials and dictionaries, after all.

266
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,640
You can't mean it! 
Scar's whereabouts are still unknown.

267
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,640
We can't guard you in 
such a high-traffic area!

268
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,080
Well, you can report that to your superiors, 
or whatever else you like!

269
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,060
This is our problem!

270
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,750
We've finally found ourselves a lead. Sorry.

271
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,230
Marcoh-san's research journal...

272
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,430
It definitely appears to be 
an ordinary cookbook at first glance.

273
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,750
The secret to the Philosopher's Stone 
is written in here, huh?

274
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,840
It's encoded, to protect 
against it being misused.

275
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,730
They do say that alchemy was born in the kitchen, after all!

276
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,010
With me working on this, it'll be a piece of cake!

277
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,050
And here I thought I could solve this right away...

278
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,680
This is one hard code to break.

279
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,530
If only we could ask 
Marcoh-san directly.

280
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,350
He abandoned his research.

281
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,650
We can't very well 
rely on him anymore.

282
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,550
Yo, Ed, Al!

283
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,570
Are you doing all right?

284
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,780
Lt. Colonel! What's the deal? 
We haven't seen you around at all!

285
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:52,530
It's Scar's appearance. 
He's got us running all over.

286
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,140
Al, did you get your body fixed up all right?

287
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,600
Yes, thank goodness.

288
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,380
Those two are on familiar terms with the Lt. Colonel!

289
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,510
Lt. Colonel Hughes!

290
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,240
If anything were to happen here, 
we could not ensure the safety of these two.

291
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,130
They should return to quarters at the Command Center.

292
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,140
I asked you to leave us alone!

293
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,120
As long as we do not know 
where Scar is,

294
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,010
we should reexamine 
our security structure!

295
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,580
Lt. Ross is definitely right.

296
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,020
Lt. Colonel!

297
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,690
However, I can't make the call 
on my own authority.

298
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,520
Why don't you ask Major Armstrong?

299
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,080
No! Please, not him!

300
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,080
No, not him!

301
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,530
Lt. Colonel,

302
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,370
I'm just one step away. 
I'm begging you.

303
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,260
I'm at a point where I can't do 
very much about the Scar matter...

304
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,690
On top of that, all the case records have been burned up.

305
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,590
There isn't any work to be done.

306
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:47,670
Case records? 
Those were at the branch as well?

307
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:51,430
Uh-huh. Affidavit records, 
lists of names, the whole bit.

308
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,930
Lt. Colonel!

309
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,930
Me?!

310
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:03,980
Um, sure, I've read the military's 
criminal records and lists of convicts.

311
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,440
You'll be fine.

312
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,440
If what you say is true, 
this will help us out greatly.

313
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,950
I'll vouch for her. If you're going to hire her, now's the time.

314
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,460
You mean it? To think that I, 
whose only ability is reading,

315
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,260
would become part of 
the Court-Martial Office...

316
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,030
It's not like that.

317
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:23,920
Working at something really hard is a talent in and of itself.

318
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,680
You have an incredible memory, after all.

319
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,420
I think you should be proud of it.

320
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,510
Thank you.

321
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,350
Um, I will do the best I can! 
Thanks for your consideration!

322
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:42,030
All right! Now that that's settled, let's get right to work.

323
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,350
I pay handsomely!

324
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,130
Thank you very much!

325
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,930
I guess I've got no choice.

326
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:57,100
I'll send someone from the 
Court-Martial Office to cover library security.

327
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,680
Eh? Thanks, man. And I didn't even mean for this to happen, either.

328
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,120
Liar!

329
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,110
See you later. Don't go 
working on that too hard.

330
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,630
Just a moment please, Lt. Colonel!

331
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,130
Lt. Ross...

332
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,800
I know what you're going to say,

333
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,720
but they are not the kind of guys 
who give up easily.

334
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,110
I'll dispatch additional men to you by tomorrow.

335
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,560
I'm asking you to make do.

336
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,190
Why are you supporting them this much?

337
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,670
Letting them continue to work, 
when you know the danger to them...

338
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,820
Those boys are still children!

339
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,200
Which is why we're protecting them.

340
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,130
Right now, what they're doing is something that only they can do.

341
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:44,250
It is the role of us adults to 
watch over children like them.

342
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,980
I leave you to it.

343
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,150
Brother!

344
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,410
You're homunculi, are you?

345
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:07,390
My, there are still humans 
who believe in our existence.

346
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,790
I didn't get to eat him.

347
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,190
I would've liked to have verified Marcoh's research journal.

348
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,810
But now there's no need to, is there?

349
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,910
Ah, you're awake?

350
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,670
This is a surprise. I didn't think 
you were going to come back to life.

351
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,670
Where am I?

352
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,550
Mister, you're an Ishbalan, right?

353
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,460
Don't worry!

354
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,720
This is a town of Ishbalans!

355
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,470
Grandpa! He's back to life!

356
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:20,530
You've held on to your life, 
young one.

357
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,390
You're the guy, aren't you?

358
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,740
The one on the wanted list.

359
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,750
Relax.

360
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,710
There's no one here who would sell out one of their own.

361
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,750
I had no idea there were 
this many surviving Ishbalans.

362
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,930
It's not just here. There are little villages all over the land,

363
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:44,340
and everyone is still going strong.

364
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:49,590
"The entire world is the 
bosom of our god, Ishbala."

365
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,900
No results today either, huh?

366
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,300
I don't know what it is that they're studying,

367
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,670
but I wish they would 
throw in the towel already.

368
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:13,120
Those boys won't give up until they've found something.

369
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:17,030
And it's our job to protect them.

370
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,750
You've gotta be kidding me!

371
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:26,470
Now I understand... the reason 
this is called the devil's research...

372
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,280
the reason Marcoh-san 
abandoned his research...

373
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,350
Brother...

374
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,440
It's no wonder!

375
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,640
The material needed for making a Philosopher's Stone...

376
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,350
is live human beings!

377
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,030
Huh? What's the matter?

378
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,080
And here I thought...

379
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,030
I finally thought it was 
within our grasp!

380
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,980
You're going?

381
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,390
Thanks for your help.

382
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,960
You <i>could</i> just stay here.

383
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,550
I cannot do that.

384
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,380
I am a person who has 
betrayed the way of God.

385
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,530
That arm is amazing.

386
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,580
Yeah.

387
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,850
We are still crying out

388
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,850
bokura wa ima demo sakenderu

389
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,880
It's something very precious 
given to me by my family.

390
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,850
You squeeze your right hand, as if to reassure yourself

391
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,850
tashikameru you ni nigirishimeta migite

392
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,700
Go on, take those annoying rules and dash them away!

393
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,700
uzattai housoku o buchikowashite yuke

394
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,840
If it comes down to having to rest your wounded feet,

395
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,840
kizutsuita ashi o yasumaseru gurai nara

396
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,730
you've gotta keep moving forward, if only just a step!

397
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,730
tatta ippo demo koko kara susume

398
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,500
We've pushed our way

399
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,500
through the twisting winds

400
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,500
yuganda kaze o kaki wakete

401
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,630
and gotten beyond the cold sky

402
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,630
tsumetai sora o oikoshite

403
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,400
Yet we still continue to wander

404
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,400
soredemo mada samayoi tsuzuketeru

405
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,570
We always find ourselves crying out

406
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,570
bokura wa itsudemo sakenderu

407
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:11,910
Just continuing to believe is not the answer

408
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:11,910
shinji tsuzukeru dake ga kotae janai

409
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,620
We must bare our weaknesses and wounds,

410
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,620
yowasa mo kizu mo sarake dashite

411
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,300
and continue to struggle,

412
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,300
or nothing will ever turn out!

413
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,300
mogaki tsuzukenakereba hajimaranai

414
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:29,000
Break on through to the other side of the door!

415
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:29,000
tsukiyabure tobira no mukou e

416
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,600
To the other side of the door!

417
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,600
tobira no mukou e

418
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,460
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

419
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,960
The Truth Behind Truths

420
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,910
The Truth Behind Truths

421
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,980
The Truth Behind Truths

422
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,290
Episode 19: "The Truth Behind Truths"

423
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,310
Central 5th Laboratory...

424
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,900
There is a hell there 
that we were unaware of.
