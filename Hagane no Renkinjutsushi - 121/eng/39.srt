1
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,820
So, you're saying you can't tell us, no matter what?

2
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,580
You see, there's this alien—

3
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,580
Scieszka, keep quiet.

4
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,500
Still, you couldn't have wound up in the power distribution station

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,560
just because you'd 
lost your way, right?

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,490
What exactly were you 
doing in there?

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,380
Sergeant...

8
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,020
What are you 
going to do now?

9
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,770
Um, Lieutenant Ross...

10
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,200
There's something going on 
within the military.

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,900
Something very dangerous.

12
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,780
Thanks.

13
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,390
Winry-san, 
what do we do now?

14
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,670
I'm going back to 
Resembool for now.

15
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,630
I'd like to talk to Ed and Al, 
but I don't know where they are.

16
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,450
Then what should I do?

17
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,810
What are you talking about? You're coming with me!

18
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,680
But what about 
my books at home?

19
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,180
Leave them there.

20
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,290
Hey...

21
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,000
I can take this off now, right?

22
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,090
Be my guest.

23
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,880
Ah, that's better.

24
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,510
The Crimson...

25
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:59,580
Well, well, if it isn't the Flame Major—make that Colonel.

26
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,890
Is something the matter?

27
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,390
Archer!

28
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,020
What is the meaning of this?!

29
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,980
Do you have some issue with the Crimson Alchemist, Lt. Colonel Zolf J. Kimbly?

30
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,150
Lt. Colonel?!

31
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,100
The Lt. Colonel was imprisoned on false charges,

32
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,320
and just before he was subjected to unlawful human experimentation at the 5th Laboratory,

33
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,330
he made a successful escape.

34
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,890
Thanks to the Lt. Colonel's testimony, the facts about the 5th Laboratory are coming to light.

35
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,770
False charges?! 
That's outrageous!

36
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:37,510
Do not forget that 
for this operation,

37
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,710
the Führer has granted me 
the rank of colonel.

38
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,790
By the way, who was 
that telephone call from?

39
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,130
Oh...

40
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,660
Do you know of 
a town called Liore?

41
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,710
What's that?

42
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,810
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

43
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,420
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

44
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,460
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

45
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,980
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

46
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:45,650
Far away, far away, our dreams will never fade

47
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:45,650
tooku tooku omoi hatenaku

48
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,950
If only the two of us could go back to

49
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,950
futari ga mujaki ni waratteta

50
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,800
the days when we laughed so innocently

00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,800
ano koro ni modoreru nara

52
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,900
the days when we laughed so innocently

53
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,900
ano koro ni modoreru nara

54
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,730

56
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,330
that has been smashed to pieces,

00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,330
glass-zaiku no you na

58
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:16,120
we're putting together the fragments of our memories

00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:16,120
omoide no kakera o atsumeteru

60
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,910
It's the important things that you notice

62
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,730
It's the important things that you notice

63
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,730

64
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:27,480
once you've lost them

65
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:27,480

66
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,730
Oh, please, oh, please, stop time for me,

douka douka jikan o tomete

68
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:40,310
and engrave the way you look right now into my heart

kimi no omokage o kono mune ni kizandekure

70
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,860
And if, and if, I were ever allowed to,

72
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,270
I would be willing to sacrifice everything

subete o gisei ni shitemo ii

74
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,920
just to see that smiling face one more time

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,920
ano egao o mou ichido

76
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,950
Eastern Civil War

77
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,950
Eastern Civil War

78
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,210
So, you're the one...

79
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,050
Yeah. I killed Greed.

80
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,380
Brother! What good 
does it do to say that now?

81
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,990
Martel, I don't know 
what you were thinking,

82
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,060
but to me, you and Greed were both criminals who kidnapped my brother.

83
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,540
What's more, 
he also killed Dante-san.

84
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,570
Martel-san!

85
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,780
Look out!

86
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,460
A snake?

87
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,630
You're not who I'm after.

88
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,330
Greed-san chose death 
rather than being sealed up again.

89
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,670
He was, more than anything, 
a proud man.

90
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,280
And so, I believe he wanted to be defeated by you.

91
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:18,460
The ones who I detest are 
the military who killed my friends,

92
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,770
and those two 
who dress all in black,

93
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,270
as well as the man 
who betrayed my friends.

94
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,210
Kimbly!

95
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,020
Why don't you eat it? 
They're nutritious.

96
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,460
Why don't <i>you</i> eat it?

97
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,100
Oh, my. If I did that, it would be cannibalism, wouldn't it?

98
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,720
We're getting close to Liore, huh?

99
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,640
Yeah.

100
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,070
I wonder how Rose-san is doing.

101
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,570
Who's that?

102
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,400
Don't pretend you've forgotten.

103
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Brother, you've been a little worried about her, right?

104
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,050
Hey, Martel, how soon 
before we get to Ishbal?

105
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,210
We're here.

106
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,660
We've long since entered Ishbal.

107
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,220
This is Ishbal?

108
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,580
There's nothing here, 
huh, Brother?

109
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,630
We need some way 
to find Scar, but this...

110
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,840
What exactly are you 
looking for, anyway?

111
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,610
A Philosopher's Stone.

112
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,490
There was a man who said

113
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,820
they had created a Philosopher's Stone before Ishbal was destroyed.

114
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,770
That can't be true.

115
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,390
They offered no resistance

116
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,910
and were killed before they 
had a chance to take up arms.

117
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,820
No way they offered 
no resistance!

118
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:59,300
The military and Ishbal had 
a long and tense military relationship.

119
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,920
Then an incident where a soldier mistakenly shot a civilian took place,

120
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,050
and the Ishbalans rose up.

121
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,420
So that's really 
how it was presented...

122
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,020
I didn't know.

123
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,930
I was in that laboratory for a little over fourteen years.

124
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,800
Since just after the civil war in Ishbal broke out?

125
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,170
Thanks to being turned into a Chimera, 
I may look young,

126
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,050
but I'm your fairly older sister.

127
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,200
You mean aunt—

128
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,690
Sorry.

129
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,970
We were a special operations unit.

130
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,550
We weren't told 
what our destination was

131
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,770
or what the details of our mission were 
until the last minute.

132
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,720
That's the way 
they usually did it.

133
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:00,930
What's going on?!

134
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,780
We're in dire straits!

135
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:12,760
What's going on?

136
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,020
I don't know! But people are being killed!

137
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,000
The mission we had been given 
was to infiltrate the Ishbalan city

138
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,780
and conduct large-scale subversive activities.

139
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,780
In any case, let's get someplace safe!

140
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,770
It was under the pretext of preventing them 
from carrying out acts of terrorism

141
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,750
that they were planning to commit against Central.

142
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,660
And you're saying that's what 
brought about the Ishbalan uprising?

143
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,780
What reason would the military have for starting a war with Ishbal?!

144
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,580
I don't know 
what the reason was.

145
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,490
There, you see?!

146
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,160
But I do have proof.

147
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,470
I don't get it.

148
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,420
Just listen to me.

149
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,470
Right after the Ishbalan 
Civil War started,

150
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,360
we were placed in custody.

151
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,600
Anyone who resisted...

152
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,850
Dammit!

153
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,520
What's going on here?! 
We were following military orders!

154
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,760
Those who survived were 
taken to the 5th Laboratory.

155
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,880
Dolcetto!

156
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,380
Martel!

157
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,550
What is this?

158
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,990
Martel!

159
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,410
They made you a Chimera.

160
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,910
The military tried to 
completely silence us. Why?

161
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,980
Because you knew a secret that 
absolutely could not be leaked out—

162
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,800
the truth about 
the start of the war.

163
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,610
But why?

164
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,800
Why would the military 
provoke Ishbal?!

165
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,360
Someone's there?

166
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,360
What?

167
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,560
It's a lead!

168
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,520
You're not getting away!

169
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,950
Now then, let's have you tell me 
what you're doing here.

170
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,310
Th-This area is 
off-limits to civilians.

171
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:13,460
We're here to check on the security of the old Ishbalan cities.

172
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,490
Then you could've just shown yourselves instead of sneaking around, right?

173
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:22,040
Yeah. He may not look it, 
but my brother is a State Alchemist.

174
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,970
What are you guys, moles?

175
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,470
Brother, could those men be...

176
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,860
Yo...

177
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,250
You guys...

178
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,360
Then the Colonel is here too?

179
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,050
Well aren't you a familiar face?

180
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,940
Yeah, yeah, same old shrimp who's so small

181
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,900
you'd lose sight of him 
among the grains of san—

182
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,890
Who are you calling that?!

183
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,730
I hear you've been raising hell 
all over the place.

184
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,850
The Southern Command Center, 
as well as the Ishbalan escort train.

185
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,320
Anyhow, you're under 
my command from now on.

186
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,230
Just a moment, please!

187
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,570
You're lucky that Havoc caught you when they were out scouting.

188
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:33,040
But we're supposed to have permission to continue our journey independently.

189
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,460
However, once called up, 
I become a dog of the military.

190
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,790
Brother...

191
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:43,500
They've come all the way out to this 
remote region in a military transport train.

192
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,680
Don't tell me there's a war.

193
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,380
We're just quelling 
a somewhat seditious area.

194
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,190
Our target is a town about two 
kilometers south-southeast of here.

195
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,800
You're pretty heavily armed, considering.

196
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,030
Are we?

197
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,400
Shall I tell you why you're here?

198
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,110
It's Scar, right?

199
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,140
We were just looking 
for him ourselves.

200
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,870
What are your reasons 
for pursuing Scar?

201
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:21,380
If we don't put him down, 
he's going to make a lot of trouble.

202
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,170
Oh, Alphonse-kun,

203
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,520
you don't have to force yourself to pretend you're eating.

204
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,740
Y-Yes, you're right.

205
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,970
I'll kill that woman!

206
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,830
What's that?

207
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:41,100
The latest photographs 
from our surveillance balloon.

208
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,950
Is that...

209
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:50,950
It couldn't be...

210
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,950
A transmutation circle 
made from the whole city?

211
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,330
Who would do such a thing?

212
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,330
I won!

213
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,420
Scar.

214
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,130
So it <i>is</i> him?

215
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,390
Edward-kun, do you know what his objective is?

216
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,320
No. So, what town is this?

217
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,830
The town is named Liore.

218
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,380
Last year, its tyrannical priest retired,

219
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,850
and peace has just barely returned with the stationing of troops there.

220
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,490
Sergeant Fuery...

221
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,490
Sir?

222
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,680
He knows.

223
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,470
Liore, you say?

224
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,960
An armed uprising in Liore?

225
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,630
This shouldn't be happening!

226
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,960
We put down that bogus priest and brought peace to the city!

227
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,500
No.

228
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,590
After that, the people divided into 
a priest faction and a citizen's faction,

229
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,120
and there has been 
terrible confusion.

230
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,260
When the military went in 
to gather a situation report,

231
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,310
both factions stood against them.

232
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,260
Why didn't you 
tell me about this?!

233
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,180
I was involved in this 
from the start!

234
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,640
I heard the report from Hughes, but I kept it back.

235
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,290
Why?!

236
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,270
Because it was too much for you to handle.

237
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,620
Don't Ed-kun and Al-kun know about Brigadier General Hughes?

238
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,200
Apparently not.

239
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,680
If he tells them now, they'd probably just dash back to Central, and all.

240
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,710
He is an important military asset, 
and everything.

241
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,480
Edward-kun and his brother are in a dangerous position right now.

242
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:38,230
He probably wants to have them in a place where he can keep his eye on them.

243
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,690
Um, is my brother here?

244
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,150
You will give me first priority when reporting.

245
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:56,750
And if you will observe my earlier conditions, 
I will grant you permission.

246
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,910
Ed! What are you doing here?!

247
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,650
At his insistence,

248
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,750
I am having him 
reconnoiter the town of Liore.

249
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,500
You're sending one of our precious State Alchemists out to sightsee?

250
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,260
Which is exactly why no matter what happens, 
he will come back to us alive.

251
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,260
Besides,

252
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,410
he knows more about Liore than anyone else does.

253
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,470
Please put your mind at ease.

254
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,090
He said he would 
leave his brother here.

255
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:31,610
He's not about to leave his dear brother here and disappear by himself on us, right?

256
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,050
Why didn't you tell me?!

257
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,740
If I had, would you have given me permission?

258
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,120
You've learned about Liore, and now you're confused.

259
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,100
That's why I'm going to 
cool my head now.

260
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,630
Phew, it was hot in there.

261
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:01,320
Be careful. The way the military sees it, you're a wanted person.

262
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,710
Brother, are you serious about this? You're going to Liore alone?

263
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,070
Leaving you behind 
was the bargaining point.

264
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:13,480
Archer doesn't trust us at all.

265
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,600
I wonder if that transmutation circle is for a Philosopher's Stone.

266
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,820
If it is, I'm going to destroy it.

267
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:23,080
Martel, behave yourself.

268
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:28,330
I know. I held myself back in front of 
that Archer guy earlier, didn't I?

269
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,510
I'm going to kill those guys in black and Kimbly first.

270
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,090
Taking my revenge against 
the military comes after that.

271
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,440
I'm not going to let you 
do that, you know.

272
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,810
Brother, be really careful, okay?

273
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:46,960
Yeah.

274
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,770
M-Major...

275
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,830
You're here?

276
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,030
Colonel Archer said to 
leave your silver watch here.

277
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,490
Oh yeah. I guess it would be trouble if someone found out my position.

278
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:15,710
Edward Elric, 
why did you come here?

279
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,550
Fate, maybe?

280
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,300
That's not like you.

281
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,280
I doubt you two 
even believe in fate.

282
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,190
A new silver watch has arrived.

283
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:46,200
Give this one the transmutation amplification treatment as well.

284
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,130
Is that right?

285
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,560
You were driven out of the city because of that priest, huh?

286
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,900
That Cornello guy was 
positively awful, all right.

287
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,490
By the way, I get the feeling that 
I've seen your face around somewhere.

288
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,730
Really?

289
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,490
Must be one of those 
common faces.

290
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,460
It's the Holy Mother!

291
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,170
You're in luck!

292
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:37,930
Huh?

293
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,010
It's the Holy Mother.

294
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,610
<i>Rose?</i>

295
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,820
Please go back inside!

296
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,000
The Colonel said that under no circumstances was anyone to see you!

297
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,220
Because I'm officially deceased?

298
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,080
At least allow me to do as I like 
in the evening.

299
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,290
But...

300
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,830
You sure are pesky.

301
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:24,880
No!

302
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,300
Kimbly!

303
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,470
Hey there.

304
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,230
To think that we would be 
seeing the boy here again...

305
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,020
What should we do, Gluttony?

306
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:46,230
Pride told us, right? 
The Ishbal...

307
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,150
um...

308
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:51,640
Kill anyone who knows the truth about Ishbal.

309
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,700
That's too bad.

310
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,710
I smell it. I smell it!

311
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,090
The smell of the Ishbalan beast!

312
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
On the day you left,

313
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
On the day you left,

314
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330

315
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330

317
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,620

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840

321
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840
Almost as if I would see you again

I want to be the sky for you,
