1
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,910
Hughes-san... I'm here again.

2
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,300
For crying out loud,

3
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,170
be more thorough when you rebuild these things, would you, Winry?

4
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,420
Now what do we do?

5
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,860
There's still a good distance to go 
before we reach Ishbal.

6
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,520
What do we do?

7
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,000
All we can do is walk.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,420
Eh!? We can't! I might be all right, 
but it's going to wear you out, Brother.

9
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,870
Then what would you rather do?!

10
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,460
There aren't any tracks into Ishbal, 
all the usual roads have been closed down,

11
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,970
and we can't very well get the military to send us there anymore.

12
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,320
You <i>are</i> right about that...

13
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,810
Let's just keep going.

14
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,840
If we just stand around here,

15
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,370
Ishbal isn't very well 
going to come to us.

16
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,490
Brother!

17
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,970
Jeez, why is he always so haphazard?

18
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,780
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,370
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

20
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,410
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

21
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,490
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

22
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,660
Far away, far away, our dreams will never fade

23
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,660
tooku tooku omoi hatenaku

24
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,960
If only the two of us could go back to

25
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,960
futari ga mujaki ni waratteta

26
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,810
the days when we laughed so innocently

27
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,810
ano koro ni modoreru nara

28
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,910
the days when we laughed so innocently

29
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,910
ano koro ni modoreru nara

30
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:10,740
Just like glassware

32
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:16,340
that has been smashed to pieces,

33
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:16,340
glass-zaiku no you na

34
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:24,130
we're putting together the fragments of our memories

35
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:24,130
omoide no kakera o atsumeteru

36
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,920
It's the important things that you notice

38
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,740
It's the important things that you notice

39
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,740

40
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:35,490
once you've lost them

41
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:35,490

42
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,740
Oh, please, oh, please, stop time for me,

00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,740
douka douka jikan o tomete

44
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:48,320
and engrave the way you look right now into my heart

46
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,870
And if, and if, I were ever allowed to,

48
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,280
I would be willing to sacrifice everything

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,930

52
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,000

53
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,000
With the River's Flow

54
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,900
There, you see? 
We somehow managed to make it!

55
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,000
Somehow made it? 
We just arrived at some town, right?

56
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,530
In a town this size, we'll be able to 
procure a car and anything else we need.

57
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,850
We can't! We're kids, after all!

58
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,900
There's no way we'll be able to get someone to sell us a car.

59
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,320
Well, it's all going to work out.

60
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,270
Brother, why are you 
always like that?!

61
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,560
Think ahead a little, would you?

62
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,320
I <i>am</i> thinking ahead.

63
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,830
You are not!

64
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,720
Such as what we're about to do...

65
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,790
What?

66
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,590
Are you sure 
it's the right thing to do?

67
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,310
I understand how you feel about wanting to stop Scar-san,

68
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,980
but the goal of our journey is to 
get our original bodies back, right?

69
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,700
Well then...

70
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,310
Well then, 
what would you have us do?

71
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,500
I don't know.

72
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,820
But maybe we should do something about 
the homunculi before dealing with Scar-san.

73
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,040
Al! Do you even realize what you're saying?!

74
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,940
All I'm saying is that maybe 
there are other ways to go about this.

75
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,580
I don't know what you mean!

76
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,080
In any case, I'm saying that you have to think harder about this!

77
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,920
Shut up! 
<i>You</i> think harder about it!

78
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,670
Wh-What are you doing?!

79
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,280
Ha! That's what you get for talking too much.

80
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,680
You're awful!

81
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,330
If that's how you want it, 
I'll show you!

82
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,260
Brother, <i>you're</i> the one 
who needs to cool his head!

83
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,570
Now you've done it!

84
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,280
Take that!

85
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,210
Jeez, what are you doing?!

86
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,490
Dammit!

87
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,980
Why, you!

88
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,880
Why, you little...!

89
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,890
Brother, why are you always like that?! Why are you so stubborn?!

90
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,540
I'm not stubborn!

91
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,600
Yes, you are!

92
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,630
Brother, if you'd act 
more accommodating,

93
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,260
maybe we could discuss this with Dad or something.

94
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,130
Don't be ridiculous!

95
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,560
No matter what happens, I'll never ask for his help!

96
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,570
That's you being stubborn!

97
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,400
Sh-Shut up!

98
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,780
Suit yourself!

99
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,780
Come on, Brother!

100
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,240
Brother, I say!

101
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,750
I haven't seen you in a while, huh?

102
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,750
Um, Book... Book-bull... I mean, Bookworm-san.

103
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,300
It's Scieszka.

104
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,130
Right.

105
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,840
Um, Winwin-san...

106
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,430
It's Winry.

107
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,970
Sorry.

108
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,690
Um...

109
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,690
Um...

110
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,470
Yes? What is it?

111
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,470
No, you go first.

112
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,370
Uh, well...

113
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,440
The truth is, there's something I'd like to discuss with you.

114
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,870
With me?

115
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,550
I've been investigating for a long time 
about why Lt. Colonel—

116
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,630
I mean, why Brigadier General Hughes had to die.

117
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,250
Lt. Colonel—I mean, 
Brigadier General Hughes—

118
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,790
Er...

119
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,660
Why don't we just 
call him Hughes-san?

120
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,380
Ah, okay.

121
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,130
So?

122
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,210
It's strange.

123
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,500
Strange?

124
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,010
The more I look into it, the more strange things keep turning up.

125
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,150
I don't know what 
I should do about it.

126
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,230
Why are you telling me this?

127
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,380
I can't trust anyone in the military.

128
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,480
Not even Colonel Mustang.

129
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,570
Please! I can't take this anymore!

130
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,730
If I don't tell someone, I'll... I'll...

131
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,990
All right! All right, okay?

132
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,990
Calm down.

133
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,740
Thank you!

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,190
Sheesh, what's his deal?!

135
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,230
You gotta be kidding me.

136
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,040
Al, pass the salt.

137
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,510
Damn...

138
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,890
These are the materials that Hughes-san had me bring together and copy down.

139
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:51,400
And these are the materials I used to 
reference them, which I've collected on my own.

140
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,410
Uh, you're not saying you 
want me to read <i>all</i> of this, right?

141
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,470
Is that okay?

142
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,820
That's absolutely impossible!

143
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,570
How many months do you think that would take?!

144
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,420
Is that right? 
In that case, allow me...

145
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,410
It started with the accident that collapsed the 5th Laboratory.

146
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:13,470
There aren't any records, so there's no way for me 
to know what was happening in the shadows.

147
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,190
However, that's where 
Hughes-san's investigation began.

148
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,590
Then...

149
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,900
Yes? What did you find out?

150
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:28,570
Right. Hughes-san was investigating the 5th Laboratory and the Ishbalan Rebellion.

151
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,570
Ishbal?

152
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,680
This is just my conjecture, but I think

153
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,070
that Hughes-san discovered an important secret that he wasn't supposed to know, and...

154
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,830
He was killed?

155
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,420
Ah, okay! I get it! Don't cry!

156
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,670
Brother, you dummy...

157
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,050
Al! Do you even realize what you're saying?!

158
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,120
Yes, I do!

159
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,770
I know at least that 
<i>she</i> is ahead of us.

160
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,170
Brother?! Jeez, where were—

161
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,020
Martel-san!

162
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,820
Long time no see.

163
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,640
As I was looking through this material, 
I kept running into a certain person's name.

164
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,830
What person?

165
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,880
Captain Juliet Douglas,

166
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,580
the woman they say was the trigger for the Ishbalan Rebellion.

167
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,430
But something is strange about that.

168
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:34,370
She died in an accident two years before the Ishbalan Rebellion.

169
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,300
Can I have you look at this?

170
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,060
Wh-What is this?

171
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,990
It was in Hughes-san's files.

172
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,690
He sent away to 
her hometown for it.

173
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,760
The year she died is two years 
before the Ishbalan Rebellion, all right,

174
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,440
but it's just some 
kind of error, right?

175
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,550
Some mistake in the records, or someone with the same name or something.

176
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,270
There are no mistakes in the government records, or in the military records.

177
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,700
What's more...

178
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,950
What's more?

179
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,160
She's still in the military.

180
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,500
Please look at this.

181
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,750
What's going on here?

182
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:19,070
According to the grave record, she died two years before the Ishbalan Rebellion.

183
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,670
However, according to the military materials,

184
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,270
she fought in the war against Ishbal, without her name being cleared from the enlistment rolls,

185
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,520
and currently, she has been 
promoted to the Führer's secretary.

186
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,130
That's strange, isn't it?

187
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,110
Someone who's supposed to be dead 
is the Führer's secretary?

188
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,640
That's not all, either.

189
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,030
There's more?!

190
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,610
If she really is alive,

191
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,870
then at the very least, 
she has to be in her fifties.

192
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,490
But right now, the Juliet-san that is serving as the Führer's secretary

193
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:49,010
has to be in her mid-thirties any way you look at it!

194
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,710
She died, but she's not dead! She doesn't age, either!

195
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,800
Who in the world 
is this woman?

196
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,170
These are all things that I could not explain,

197
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,510
but after I became desperate and thought about it all,

198
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,950
I arrived at a certain hypothesis.

199
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,020
A hypothesis?

200
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,520
If my hypothesis is right, then all of the inconsistencies are swept away.

201
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,030
Juliet Douglas-san...

202
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,030
is an alien.

203
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,010
No, I don't think so. 
Not a chance.

204
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,750
Then what else could it be?

205
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,450
I-I don't know.

206
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,050
But if we continue 
to investigate this,

207
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,130
we'll find out who killed Hughes-san, right?

208
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,880
But how do we do that?

209
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,230
I am a soldier for the time being, but I'm a records clerk,

210
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,900
and with Juliet-san 
being with the Führer,

211
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,810
I can't very well 
get too close to her.

212
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,650
I can't investigate 
what she's up to.

213
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,440
In that case, what if we were to wiretap her line, to find out more about her?

214
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,300
Wiretap?! That's the thing that wives do 
to get evidence on their husbands

215
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,810
when they're going 
through a divorce, right?

216
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,840
I don't know if I can do that...

217
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,450
Sure you can!

218
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,930
Let's wiretap!

219
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,800
Martel-san, 
what are you doing here?

220
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,170
I followed you.

221
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,460
I wanted you to tell me about your enemies.

222
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,630
My enemies?

223
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,550
Those guys who dress all in black.

224
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,550
What are you going to do to them once you know?

225
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,810
That's obvious.

226
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,580
Take my revenge.

227
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,570
I'm sorry about my uniform.

228
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,100
When all you do is heavy labor, 
your arms do tend to thicken up, huh?

229
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,580
Maybe I should go on 
a diet or something.

230
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,330
As far as that matter goes, I'll make out the report.

231
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,100
Is something the matter?

232
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,340
No.

233
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,330
Do you know those 
two people from earlier?

234
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,190
Yeah, from before.

235
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,850
This is it. The telephone lines should all be concentrated in this facility.

236
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,510
But there are 
so many locks on it,

237
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,550
and there must be some 
secure alarm devices, too.

238
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,940
It won't be all that easy 
to slip in there.

239
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,410
It's open.

240
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,660
This much was easy, easy!

241
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,620
A-Amazing...

242
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,670
Come on, let's go.

243
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,860
So, where is her room?

244
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,890
The central hall, number 103.

245
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,630
103... 103...

246
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,390
Here it is.

247
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,390
All right, we're okay.

248
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,390
Now we just have to wait.

249
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,290
You're wrong!

250
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,610
If you do this, then it won't mean anything for Greed-san, Roa-san and the others

251
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,860
to have protected you, Martel-san!

252
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,320
You know about me, right?

253
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:16,240
I'm a Chimera. I can't go on living as a regular person anymore.

254
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,480
I've lost my friends, Greed-san,

255
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,210
and the only place 
where I could have lived.

256
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,370
But you can't take revenge 
because of it!

257
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,890
It won't do any good 
to try to stop me.

258
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,720
I'm half snake now, 
so my vindictiveness runs deep.

259
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,730
You just can't do that.

260
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,740
<i>She reminds me of Scar-san.</i>

261
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,570
There isn't anything left for me.

262
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,440
And those guys are 
your enemies, aren't they?

263
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,850
In that case, 
I'll take care of them.

264
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,350
I don't plan on assisting you 
in your revenge,

265
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,860
nor do I intend 
to let you take it.

266
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,140
Why not?!

267
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,370
Because I'm sure that's what 
Roa-san and the others were thinking.

268
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,930
See you around.

269
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,260
<i>That's right. That's why I have to stop them—</i>

270
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,890
<i>both Scar-san and Martel-san.</i>

271
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,680
Hey, Al!

272
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,080
It's no easy task finding him.

273
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,310
Edward! Hey, Edward!

274
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,330
I can't find Alphonse anywhere.

275
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,080
Did something happen?

276
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,040
How should I know about him?

277
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,540
Fighting again?

278
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,480
It's his fault.

279
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,300
He keeps pestering me about when Dad is coming home.

280
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,010
That is a problem.

281
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,870
I wonder where 
Alphonse could have gone.

282
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,330
I just don't know 
where he could be.

283
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,090
Why do I have to go?

284
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,710
Come on, let's go.

285
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,730
Yes, Führer's Office.

286
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,740
...communication coming in 
on a public line. Their code is...

287
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,670
zero, eigh... two.

288
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,040
Please put it through.

289
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,950
Here it comes! Here it comes!

290
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,140
Hey, it's me.

291
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,420
Envy,

292
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,920
using regular phone lines is supposed to be forbidden except in cases of emergency.

293
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,890
Don't be so strict.

294
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,420
You're the one who said to report in, aren't you?

295
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,670
I'm almost there, in the north.

296
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,210
It's so quiet here.

297
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,510
If things stay this calm, then I might have to—

298
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,010
You will faithfully 
carry out your task.

299
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,830
<i>What is this? Envy?</i>

300
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:26,020
Envy is one of those homunculi that Ed was talking about.

301
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,230
I'm hanging up. It sounds like 
I've got one more job to take care of.

302
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,200
Why don't we get 
out of here now?

303
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,640
Yeah, okay.

304
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,750
Um, about that 
conversation just now...

305
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,600
What in the world 
were they talking about?

306
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,960
Who knows? But somehow,

307
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,700
it seemed like they were talking about something dangerous.

308
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,910
It looks like it's going to take 
a lot more time to gather any evidence.

309
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:07,350
Even by trying wiretapping and such, it's not going to be all that easy, huh?

310
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,690
What's wrong?

311
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,530
Let's get out of here!

312
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,910
Hurry!

313
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,910
Right!

314
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,700
What is that thing?!

315
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,500
How should I know?!

316
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,370
Uh, what's the matter?

317
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,090
That girl! That girl!

318
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,720
The exit!

319
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,730
Winry-san!

320
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,670
Their mother?

321
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,300
Ed and Al's...

322
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,680
mother?

323
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,370
Winry-chan?

324
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,140
So it <i>was</i> you, Winry-chan!

325
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,160
What are you doing 
in a place like this?

326
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,400
We're saved!

327
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,110
She's an alien, all right!

328
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,860
An alien?

329
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,300
Come on, let's go.

330
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,560
Brother...

331
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,380
We're going to Ishbal.

332
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,090
Let's stop Scar-san.

333
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,920
How did you know 
I would be there?

334
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,910
You haven't changed.

335
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:34,110
You always used to sulk down by the riverside

336
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,660
whenever we got into 
a fight, you know.

337
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,000
I guess so.

338
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,850
What do we do now?

339
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,310
Not much we can do 
except walk.

340
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,390
Want to hop on?

341
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,000
Martel-san!

342
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,050
Al, you know her?

343
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,970
Yeah.

344
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,980
Okay, we'll take you up on that 
if you'd be so kind.

345
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,770
H-Hold on, Brother!

346
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,950
Where's the harm?

347
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,410
We've got to help each other out when we're in trouble, right?

348
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,090
I'm going to 
make sure I stop you.

349
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,280
All right then, we're off!

350
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,930
Right!

351
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,610
Something wrong?

352
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,270
Mm-mm.

353
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,360
Brother, do you remember?

354
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,820
The first time we ever 
got into a fight?

355
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,200
Oh, you mean the time 
you tossed me around, Al.

356
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,990
That was the first time I ever went down to the riverside.

357
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,240
Is that right?

358
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,280
That's right.

359
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,840
When we were at Sensei's place, 
you'd disappear right after we'd fight, too.

360
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,040
Thanks to you, I had to work for both of us.

361
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:02,120
We even fought over which one of us 
was going to marry Winry, huh?

362
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,790
We argued about that?

363
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,110
We did!

364
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
On the day you left,

365
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
On the day you left,

366
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330

367
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330

369
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,620

Almost as if I would see you again

373
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840
Almost as if I would see you again
