1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,440
Al!

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,100
Al!

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,690
Sensei!

4
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,750
Sensei!

5
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,340
Al!

6
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,170
Al!

7
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:35,710
Al!

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,060
Brother!

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,560
That right arm of yours 
is a nuisance.

10
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,190
I'm going to pull off 
all that useless stuff—

11
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,570
those ugly mechanical parts!

12
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,900
What did you call them?!

13
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,990
And then I'm going to take 
everything that is left over.

14
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,260
Why, you!

15
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,330
Why, you...

16
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,130
Al!

17
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,130
Al, no!

18
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,000
Al...

19
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,110
Brother,

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,640
you said that homunculi 
can't use alchemy, right?

21
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,070
But this guy is different.

22
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,130
I've figured out what his secret is.

23
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,190
When his right arm and left leg form a circle,

24
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:37,160
he can transmute the outside of his body into other materials.

25
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,080
He can change his body 
because he's a homunculus.

26
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,160
But he can use alchemy because...

27
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,170
Because he has Ed's limbs 
in those places?

28
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,670
My...?

29
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,670
Give them back! 
Those belong to Brother!

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,180
They are Brother's arm and leg!

31
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,180
Give them back!

32
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,430
Why, you!

33
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,090
Al!

34
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,110
Fine by me!

35
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,260
Brother!

36
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,610
Al! Please, stop already!

37
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,830
What are you talking about? 
He's a homunculus. He's not human.

38
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,050
But still, that boy is Izumi-san's—

39
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,090
Maybe so...

40
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,900
You want my arm, do you?

41
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,900
It's <i>my</i> arm!

42
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,220
You gained something for the price of this leg, didn't you?

43
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,950
You paid for your brother 
with this arm.

44
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:14,300
In that case, what are you going to pay to deprive me of my arm and leg?

45
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,510
An equivalent exchange.

46
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,010
Stop jerking me around!

47
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,430
Ed!

48
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,730
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

49
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,320
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

50
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,360
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

51
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,460
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

52
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,660
Far away, far away, our dreams will never fade

53
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,660
tooku tooku omoi hatenaku

54
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,960
If only the two of us could go back to

55
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,960
futari ga mujaki ni waratteta

56
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,810
the days when we laughed so innocently

57
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,810
ano koro ni modoreru nara

58
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,910
the days when we laughed so innocently

59
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,910
ano koro ni modoreru nara

60
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,740
Just like glassware

61
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,740
konagona ni kudaketa

62
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:24,340
that has been smashed to pieces,

63
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:24,340
glass-zaiku no you na

64
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:32,130
we're putting together the fragments of our memories

65
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:32,130
omoide no kakera o atsumeteru

66
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,920
It's the important things that you notice

67
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,920
daiji na mono wa itsudatte

68
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,740
It's the important things that you notice

69
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,740
daiji na mono wa itsudatte

70
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,490
once you've lost them

71
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,490
nakushite kara kizuku yo

72
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:50,740
Oh, please, oh, please, stop time for me,

73
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:50,740
douka douka jikan o tomete

74
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,320
and engrave the way you look right now into my heart

75
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,320
kimi no omokage o kono mune ni kizandekure

76
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,870
And if, and if, I were ever allowed to,

77
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,870
moshimo moshimo yurusareru nara

78
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,280
I would be willing to sacrifice everything

79
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,280
subete o gisei ni shitemo ii

80
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,930
just to see that smiling face one more time

81
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,930
ano egao o mou ichido

82
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,960
Dante of the Deep Forest

83
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,960
Dante of the Deep Forest

84
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,490
Sensei...

85
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,270
Ed! Al!

86
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,000
I forbid you to get involved!

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,500
That boy is my sin,

88
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,860
and I will...

89
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,110
Sensei!

90
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,240
Hold it!

91
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,600
Winry! Take care of Sensei!

92
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,100
Just a minute! Ed! Al!

93
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:32,450
Fullmetal Alchemist, I understand this is the island where you did your training.

94
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,960
Brother, that woman...

95
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,620
Führer, what are you doing here?

96
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,960
It appears we are looking for the same thing as you are.

97
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,650
A homunculus?

98
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,600
I hear that's what 
the enemy calls itself.

99
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,960
However,

100
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,720
do you guys know how a homunculus is born?

101
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:00,500
According to tradition, it's said that 
a homunculus is the grown-up form

102
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,490
of the botched product that is born when someone attempts a human transmutation.

103
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,500
It was written in your 
father's research as well.

104
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,390
I couldn't care less 
about the guy.

105
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,730
That's fine.

106
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:23,110
But if the boy whom Lt. Col. Archer found really is a homunculus,

107
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,840
that would mean that someone had attempted a human transmutation.

108
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,150
Human transmutation is impermissible, no matter what the circumstances are.

109
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,100
Do you have any idea 
who this person might be?

110
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,600
Never mind that, we should be after the escaped homunculus.

111
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,170
Our men are already pursuing him.

112
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,440
I'm sorry, but I don't know. 
We're in a hurry here, so if you don't mind...

113
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,490
Brother...

114
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,180
We can't tell them 
about Sensei, you know.

115
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,370
Maybe so, but...

116
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,510
Well? How does it feel, holding him?

117
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,370
It's not bad.

118
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,160
Wrath... That makes all seven of us.

119
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,890
After all this time, how about we go to that woman's place?

120
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,890
Luckily, it's close by, and we do need to tell her about Greed.

121
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,680
Why Greed?

122
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,430
Because long ago, 
she's the one who created Greed.

123
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,270
Why?!

124
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,020
Why did you show that 
to my brother?!

125
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,830
The man understood 
everything I told him.

126
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:37,410
What I handed down to him were the ancient memories of the Ishbalan people.

127
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,240
And as a result, my brother...!

128
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,440
You must not forget.

129
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,250
Inside here, they are still alive.

130
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,750
Countless lives...

131
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,760
He's here!

132
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,760
Here he is!

133
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:02,450
Due to circumstances beyond our control, we left our established residences.

134
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,240
As their leader, I will bear full responsibility.

135
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,480
You do know that new residences have been established here in the south, right?

136
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,300
You will all be taken there.

137
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,760
Make sure that you tell them not to offer any resistance.

138
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,610
Right.

139
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,150
However, before that happens, we will be checking everyone's names and faces.

140
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,410
Every last one of you.

141
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,410
Is there someone 
you're looking for?

142
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,250
Begin.

143
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:35,140
Please, be careful. I'm sure I saw 
that homicidal maniac from Central.

144
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,340
I saw his wanted poster at the home of someone I was taking care of earlier.

145
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,430
Let's hope you didn't 
mistake him for someone else.

146
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,190
Mama!

147
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,190
All right, you all!

148
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,690
Hey, where is he?! 
The man with the X-shaped scar!

149
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,770
It won't do you 
any good to hide him!

150
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,440
What's going on here?!

151
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,360
J-Just you try doing anything against me! 
The military won't stand for—

152
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,880
A-A gunshot?!

153
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,530
I didn't hear any gunfire!

154
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,140
Stop! Don't shoot!

155
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,310
Stop firing, you stupid bastards!

156
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,650
Everyone, calm down!

157
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,030
Who was it that 
acted against this man?

158
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,230
Is the massacre 
going to repeat itself?!

159
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,360
We've already had 
too much of this!

160
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,770
Right! How can we 
keep silent any longer?!

161
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,180
I'm sick of being under the military's thumb!

162
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,670
Our people have been killed!

163
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,130
Go back to where 
you came from, now!

164
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,830
Yeah! Get out of here!

165
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,430
Yow!

166
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,530
I'm going to suppress them. 
Cover me.

167
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,170
Colonel?

168
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,170
What are you waiting for? I told you to cover me!

169
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,400
And wipe your forehead, would you?

170
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,940
Yes, sir!

171
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,390
Good grief. What a pathetic story, both for master and pupil.

172
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,050
Ed, Al...

173
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,880
Still, I must draw the line somewhere.

174
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,800
You are expelled.

175
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:44,960
I did not teach you alchemy so that your bodies would end up like this.

176
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,770
I don't want to see any more of 
your disgraceful fighting, either.

177
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,970
Sensei...

178
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,710
Thank you... for taking care of us.

179
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,180
Please, take care.

180
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,750
Are you two sure you just 
want to go back home like this?

181
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,350
Okay, then...

182
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,300
Yeah. Come by again 
if you're ever around.

183
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,080
But...

184
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,350
She expelled us, and all, right?

185
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,800
Foolish bastards!

186
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,960
Now that you are 
neither master nor pupil,

187
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,480
it means you can start dealing with each other as equal individuals.

188
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,940
That's right! Now, you don't have to feel so constrained by her, do you?

189
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,820
Dammit. Al, we're going back!

190
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,380
Huh? Mm-hmm!

191
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,630
Don't go getting killed.

192
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,420
Sensei! We came here to get some kind of lead as to how to get our original bodies back!

193
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,890
We're not leaving empty-handed!

194
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,140
Leave!

195
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,790
We're not leaving.

196
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,850
We want to know the whereabouts of a true Philosopher's Stone,

197
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,400
not the one made by 
sacrificing human lives.

198
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,200
Leave.

199
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,300
We're not leaving!

200
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,410
I'll cut you up!

201
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,460
Cut us if you will...

202
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,800
...but we're not leaving!

203
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,750
I'm sure that returning that boy over to the other side is...

204
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,400
That is my sin.

205
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,770
I cannot teach you how to do it.

206
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,360
We will take the sin upon ourselves as well!

207
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,330
You morons...

208
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,050
You have someone 
watching the brothers, right?

209
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:36,830
Yes, sir.

210
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,020
Don't be caught off guard. 
If anything happens, let me know immediately.

211
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,790
Yes, sir.

212
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,450
The Elric brothers again?

213
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,840
What choice do we have?

214
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,290
We received a response from Central that 
the Führer did in fact drop by down south here

215
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,060
and conducted his own personal investigation into the homunculus.

216
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,670
Which is exactly the opposite of what they said yesterday.

217
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,040
And with investigations 
pertaining to the homunculi

218
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,540
now under the direct 
supervision of the Führer?

219
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,860
We find out everything the brothers know, like we were originally going to.

220
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,610
There's the possibility that 
the Chimera might appear again.

221
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,600
Kimbly too.

222
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,010
Let's go.

223
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,000
This is a foul place 
we've come to.

224
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,500
Greed-san?

225
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,060
Roa, you guys 
go back to Devil's Nest.

226
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,060
Are you going off 
someplace by yourself?

227
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,570
There's just something 
that's been bothering me.

228
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,970
I see.

229
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,310
So, Al, you don't remember anything about the other side of the doorway, huh?

230
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,170
No.

231
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,400
If not, then Al's body, 
together with those memories,

232
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,750
could still be on the other side.

233
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,320
How can we get them 
back from there?

234
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,640
If we use a Philosopher's Stone, then we can ignore the Principle of Equivalent Exchange

235
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,770
and open the doorway once again.

236
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,130
Equivalent exchange, huh?

237
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:21,040
Ed, do you believe in that?

238
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,980
Of course he does!

239
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,410
In order for something to be obtained, it must be accompanied by something of equal value.

240
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,010
And not just in alchemy, that's a principle throughout the whole world.

241
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,530
If that's so,

242
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,660
then that boy lost his own life before he was ever born.

243
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,540
And what did he obtain 
for that price?

244
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,920
Apparently, I'm not that good a teacher.

245
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,880
Mason!

246
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,660
Yes?

247
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,780
Show these two where Dante-san's house is.

248
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,370
Tomorrow, I'll have them 
go there to get some medicine.

249
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,330
Did you think you were 
going to stay here for free?

250
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,880
I wonder what kind of person this Dante-san is.

251
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,030
A famous pharmacist, 
from what Mason-san said.

252
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,680
Brother, there's something that's been bothering me.

253
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,150
Supposing that homunculi are born when a human transmutation fails...

254
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,980
Come on, Al, 
let's get a move on!

255
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,710
Anyone home?

256
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,050
We've been expecting you.

257
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,380
Dante-sama is waiting for you inside.

258
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,820
Huh?

259
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,380
It's you!

260
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,310
Lyra?

261
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,310
Lyra-san?

262
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,400
I'm terribly sorry for what happened on that occasion.

263
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,750
What are you doing here?

264
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,520
I am employed here 
as Dante-sama's pupil,

265
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,850
so that I may become as superb an alchemist as she is.

266
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,640
Dante-san is an alchemist?

267
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,820
Yes.

268
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,910
This is all thanks to you.

269
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,400
You taught me something important.

270
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,470
Your character has 
completely changed, huh?

271
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,760
Come in.

272
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,980
I have brought them.

273
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,240
I've been waiting for you, 
Elric brothers.

274
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,100
You're Dante-san?

275
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,320
Yes. I was surprised to find that you were Izumi's students.

276
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,100
I've heard what is going on. 
I will get her medicine ready at once.

277
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,290
U-Um, by any chance, did our teacher also...?

278
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:35,390
Yes. Long ago, 
she learned alchemy here.

279
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,610
Really?

280
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:37,320
Yes.

281
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,350
Then, Dante-san, that makes you 
our teacher's teacher!

282
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,620
I suppose that's what it means.

283
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,130
Hey, now, how did a guy 
like me get to be so lucky?

284
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:53,170
And here I just came by to see a familiar face.

285
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,480
Well,

286
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,340
there's no letting them out of my sight now.

287
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,220
Are you serious about that?

288
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,650
You <i>are</i> a fellow State Alchemist.

289
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,690
Hey, we just got word from Greed-san. 
It sounds like he needs some more hands.

290
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,280
Please, think it over.

291
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:25,640
Dante-san, why did you decide to become an alchemist?

292
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,910
Let's see...

293
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,850
It may sound corny,

294
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,420
but I suppose it was because I wanted to help people.

295
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,540
Alchemy is something 
that people need.

296
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,220
Of course, the alchemy by itself isn't anything all that special.

297
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,080
But still, when it comes to working to help others,

298
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,350
that's something 
that alchemy can do.

299
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:49,720
I'd like for people that strive to be happy to be rewarded for as hard as they work.

300
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,530
That's the way I felt.

301
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,900
Equivalent exchange?

302
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:59,880
Yes. People can only gain one thing for one effort.

303
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,200
That is the absolute truth.

304
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,020
Dante-san, what do you think 
about the Philosopher's Stone?

305
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,510
Are you two searching for 
the Philosopher's Stone too?

306
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,960
N-No, we were...

307
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,970
All those who have sought the Philosopher's Stone

308
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,550
have been driven to despair.

309
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:27,730
It may be that it is too soon for mankind to acquire the Stone.

310
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,100
You know, you bear 
such a resemblance to him.

311
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:38,340
Your father, Hohenheim the Light, 
also sought the Philosopher's Stone.

312
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,610
Our father did?

313
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,620
Do you know 
where your father is?

314
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,170
I don't even want to know.

315
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,900
Brother...

316
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,260
They've split up.

317
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,010
Handle the rest 
like we planned.

318
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,230
Got it?

319
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,110
Go!

320
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,270
Now then...

321
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,350
You...!

322
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,610
Why, you!

323
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:37,020
You must be surprised. 
I call it the Mightiest Shield.

324
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,680
Lyra-san?

325
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,690
Lyra-san!

326
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,690
Don't move!

327
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,480
As long as you don't resist, 
I have no intention of harming her.

328
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,890
Dante-san!

329
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,340
Good day.

330
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,100
Who are you folks?

331
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,070
We're kidnappers.

332
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,320
Kidnappers?

333
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,360
Alphonse Elric,

334
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,830
I'm sorry, but you'll 
have to come with us.

335
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,820
But Sensei taught me that 
I shouldn't go with strangers.

336
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,690
What are you, stupid? Just how old are you?

337
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,800
Fourteen.

338
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,420
If you're fourteen,

339
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,430
then you're old enough to think and behave all by yourself, aren't you?

340
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:31,430
Listen up. If you're a real man, you'll act on your own will!

341
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,610
Mm-hmm.

342
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:35,830
You can't go on forever doing things just because your teacher said to.

343
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,380
I get it. I have to think for myself, huh?

344
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,940
Exactly.

345
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,190
Now that you've figured that out, come with us—

346
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,990
After thinking about it for myself,

347
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,990
I've decided that I'm not 
going to go with strangers.

348
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,540
Not bad.

349
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
On the day you left,

350
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
On the day you left,

351
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
kimi ga tabidatsu hi wa

352
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
kimi ga tabidatsu hi wa

353
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,620
I said good-bye and waved, like always

354
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,620
I said good-bye and waved, like always

355
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,620
