1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,320
You performed human transmutation?!

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,190
You've committed that 
which is most sanctioned!

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,700
You've had your bodies 
taken over to the other side!

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,030
So this is why your title is "Fullmetal"!

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,370
The Fullmetal Alchemist!

6
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,010
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

7
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,010
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,010
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,010
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

10
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:39,480
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:39,480
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

12
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:39,480
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

13
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:39,480
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:39,680
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:39,680
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:39,680
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:39,680
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,480
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,480
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,480
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,520
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

22
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,520
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

23
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

24
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,480
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

25
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,230
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

26
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,230
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

27
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,230
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

28
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,230
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

29
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,950
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

30
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,950
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

31
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,350
Looking at the sky, 
thinking tomorrow must be coming,

32
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,350
asu ga kuru hazu no sora wo mite

33
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:08,850
it's too much for my captivated heart to take

34
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:08,850
mayou bakari no kokoro mote amashite iru

35
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,600
As a bird flutters along beside me,

36
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,600
katawara no tori ga habataita

37
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:19,700
I wonder where he managed to find his light

38
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:19,700
doko ka hikari wo mitsukerareta no ka na

39
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,600
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

40
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,600
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

41
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,140
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

42
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,140
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

43
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,140
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

44
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,140
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

45
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:30,310
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

46
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:30,310
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

47
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:37,700
And leave me at the highest place there is,

48
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:37,700
And leave me at the highest place there is,

49
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:37,700
soshite ichiban takai tokoro de

50
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:37,700
soshite ichiban takai tokoro de

51
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,590
far away from kindness?

52
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,590
okizari ni shite, yasashisa kara toozakete

53
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:52,960
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

54
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:52,960
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

55
00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:01,800
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

56
00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:01,800
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

57
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,970
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

58
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,970
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

59
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,520
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

60
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,520
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

61
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,520
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

62
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,520
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

63
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,500
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

64
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,500
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

65
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:13,020
Body of the Sanctioned

66
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:13,020
Body of the Sanctioned

67
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,990
I see, so that's it.

68
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:27,250
It's now clear why a kid like you should bear
 the stern-sounding title of "Fullmetal."

69
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,840
Rose, alchemy forbids 
the transmutation of gold.

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,580
At the same time, there is one other inherently forbidden practice,

71
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,760
and that is...

72
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,190
human transmutation!

73
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,080
You miserable, foolish kids!

74
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,980
You dabbled in human transmutation unaware of its penalties, didn't you?!

75
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,500
No, we didn't! We—

76
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,500
Al!

77
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,320
We just wanted...

78
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,540
We just wanted to see our mom's smiling face one more time.

79
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,590
But you failed!

80
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:17,760
Yeah. My brother lost his body, 
and I lost my left leg and right arm.

81
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,380
This is what happens when two people try to bring a person back to life.

82
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,970
Rose, this is what it takes to bring someone back to life.

83
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,850
Are you prepared to go through it?!

84
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,000
There is no need for concern.

85
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,360
I have received this 
Philosopher's Stone from Leto.

86
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,240
And besides, I am not inexperienced the way they were.

87
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,700
Don't be ridiculous!

88
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,830
No matter what you offer in return, 
there are some things that cannot be done!

89
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,180
Then why do you want 
the Philosopher's Stone?

90
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,520
You think that if you had this, you could complete your mom's transmutation, right?

91
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,710
You've got it wrong, baldy.

92
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,140
We just want to get our original bodies back.

93
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,680
That is, if we <i>can</i> get them back.

94
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,480
We'll ask you one more time: 
please give us the Philosopher's Stone.

95
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,940
State Alchemist, may the wrath of God befall you.

96
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,980
Get down here, third-string,

97
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,740
and I'll show you the difference between our levels!

98
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,690
Wretched fools!

99
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,890
That was close!

100
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,470
Minister!

101
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,390
Why, you!

102
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,480
Al!

103
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,150
This way!

104
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,320
You fools! There's only one way out!

105
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,570
If there's no way out...

106
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,650
I'll just have to make one!

107
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,240
What?

108
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,580
After them!

109
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,500
Minister...

110
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,530
That ring...

111
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,010
Are the works of God alchemy?

112
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,100
Whether or not one calls it alchemy depends on the person.

113
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,470
However, what they 
cannot do, I am able to.

114
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,010
I've kept you waiting, huh?

115
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,860
Ro...se...

116
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,530
Cain?

117
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,240
Ro...se...

118
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:02,560
Cain has had his spirit first resurrected through the works of Leto.

119
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,470
His body should also become complete in a few days.

120
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,180
Minister...

121
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,800
This is the work of God, isn't it?

122
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,320
If all we wanted to do was 
take the Philosopher's Stone,

123
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,440
it's not as though we 
couldn't have done it.

124
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,570
This evening, a pair of unbelievers sought the minister's life.

125
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,580
One of them is short, and the other is wearing ancient armor.

126
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:43,160
The Minister asks that the Faithful refrain from venturing outside

127
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,070
Over there!

128
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,000
They aren't here.

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Hey, go check over there!

130
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,150
so as not to suffer any harm.

131
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,890
No question about it, 
that's the guy—the short, stranger kid!

132
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,520
Who are you calling an ultra-hyper-pipsqueak?!

133
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,820
I never called you that!

134
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,110
Anyhow, why don't you just simmer down?

135
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,240
How could you go after 
the Minister's life like that?!

136
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,580
Right! How terrible—a sweet boy like you!

137
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,730
Listen, his miracles are 
nothing more than alchemy.

138
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,750
By decomposing and restructuring matter—

139
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,700
That's a lie!

140
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,470
Moments ago, my boyfriend, Cain, returned to me.

141
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,780
That's terrific, Rose!

142
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,400
After dying in an accident, 
Cain has come back to life, huh?

143
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,860
There, you see? 
It's not just Rose, either!

144
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,560
There are many others as well!

145
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,260
She's right!

146
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,640
If that's not a miracle, 
then tell me what is!

147
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,640
Has anyone here actually seen any of those guys?!

148
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,030
Everyone is said to have left town afterwards—

149
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,160
Silence!

150
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,160
Th-The statues of Leto!

151
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,450
It's a miracle!

152
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,590
Al!

153
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,580
Give it back!

154
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,300
So this is the proof that 
you're a State Alchemist, is it?

155
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,280
It's the first time 
I've seen one of these.

156
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,300
The reason you can transmute 
without a transmutation circle

157
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,800
is that this thing works like an amplifier, right?

158
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,130
I didn't get any sleep at all.

159
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,470
The bell's gone!

160
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,400
Feed it to me! My hands are like this, and everything.

161
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,750
Was it really...

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,810
your boyfriend?

163
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,480
The Philosopher's Stone is our secret alone,

164
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,670
right?

165
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:55,090
Cain... I'm sorry. I, um, I just had to talk to you a little...

166
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,090
Ro...se...

167
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:11,190
Minister! Um, I'm terribly sorry about taking the key without permission.

168
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,800
I'm sorry, Rose.

169
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,220
Even with the power of 
the Philosopher's Stone,

170
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,080
it was all I could do to offer up the lives of the birds to God,

171
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,500
in an attempt to replace them 
with the life of another, you see.

172
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Perhaps this Chimera, which tweets 
with Cain's voice, is not to your liking?

173
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,200
Give my regards to Cain.

174
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,190
Ro...se...

175
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,050
Ro...se...

176
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,400
There is only one other who knows 
the secret of the Philosopher's Stone.

177
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,590
It's dangerous here. Let's go.

178
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,550
Quickly.

179
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,310
Your flim-flamming is going to be found out soon enough.

180
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:38,250
The Faithful are not likely to distinguish between alchemy and the works of God.

181
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:43,800
No, in the sense that it brings 
happiness to them, they are the same.

182
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,710
So then, what's in it for you?

183
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,910
The basic principle of alchemy is equivalent exchange.

184
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:57,420
If you're trying to obtain something, you have to pay for it with something of appropriate value.

185
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,370
People say that 
Brother is a prodigy at it.

186
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,500
But it's only because he has paid the price of enough effort...

187
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,140
that Brother is who he is now.

188
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,280
You paid the price, didn't you?

189
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,340
An arm, a leg... a whole body...

190
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,730
and yet now you're 
trying to take them back.

191
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,350
And your mother... 
What happened to her?

192
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,180
Okay then,

193
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,170
I guess it's time I got started.

194
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,380
So, you're after money, huh?

195
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,000
Ed?

196
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,250
I can get all the money I want 
from the donations of the Faithful.

197
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:40,840
What I want are believers who would gladly throw their own lives away for me.

198
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,840
They believe in resurrection through me 
and are not afraid to die.

199
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,340
In time, they would become an invincible army.

200
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:55,310
Just you watch, in a few years, 
I will set out to tear this country apart!

201
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,420
Makes no difference to me.

202
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,270
What?!

203
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,740
After all, you can't really bring anyone back to life, right?

204
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,680
Of course not! Even if I used the Philosopher's Stone,

205
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,020
there's no telling what would happen if I performed human transmutation.

206
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,400
Why, for the sake of the Faithful, 
who are nothing more than my pawns...

207
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,460
would I run the risk of...

208
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,710
Wha—

209
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,720
What?!

210
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,720
How long?! How long 
has that mic been on?!

211
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,840
For the whole time 
you've been here.

212
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,750
How... How did you get my broadcast equipment?!

213
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,480
That was my brother.

214
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,440
Ah, what got busted up yesterday was just 
some junk that I transmuted to look like him.

215
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,570
No! It's all a lie!

216
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,900
You must not believe it!

217
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,870
Like I said, I'm on 
a whole different level!

218
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,270
Minister, was that broadcast just now for real?

219
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,250
I do not know what the heretic has broadcast in my voice,

220
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,400
but it was all a conspiracy!

221
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,950
As a testament to this, I will eradicate the heretic by the power of God!

222
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,900
This is the power of God!

223
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,600
It's a miracle!

224
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,010
The statues of Leto...

225
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,270
Give it up, would you?

226
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:06,230
Without this, you're limited to transmuting your own Automail, aren't you?

227
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,530
Pops, I'm about to show you the <i>real</i> hammer of God!

228
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,680
Impossible!

229
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,180
Not even with the Philosopher's Stone could something so gigantic be moved!

230
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:44,400
The watch has nothing to do with it. Brother is the Fullmetal Alchemist!

231
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,930
I won't let you have it! I won't let you have the Philosopher's Stone!

232
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,520
Rebound?!

233
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,110
An imitation?

234
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,900
After all the commotion you've raised...

235
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,830
After all the trouble you put me through, it was a fake?

236
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,450
Stop jerking me around!

237
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
That was quite a wild goose chase, huh?

238
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,520
And here I thought we were finally 
going to be able to restore your body.

239
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,300
You should come first, Brother.

240
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,270
That Automail is so hard on you, and all...

241
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,650
Nothing more to do 
but to keep searching, I guess.

242
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,320
How could you do that to us?

243
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:24,580
To us, the Minister's miracles gave us hope.

244
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:29,000
If we believed, even dead people could come back to life.

245
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,040
That was the only hope we had!

246
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,550
You're saying we should have 
left everything the way it was?

247
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:42,600
What am I supposed to cling to 
as I continue living from now on?!

248
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,810
Tell me!

249
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,320
You'll have to decide that for yourself.

250
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,230
Get up and walk. Move forward.

251
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,110
You've got some fine legs there, 
don't you?

252
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,870
I think Brother did all this for you.

253
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,050
He shouldn't have bothered!

254
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,550
We've seen all sorts of things.

255
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,180
How can this be?!

256
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,620
That thing you gave me wasn't the real Philosopher's Stone?!

257
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,650
Of course not. 
This city is just a decoy, after all.

258
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:42,750
Those who hear the stories about 
the Philosopher's Stone gather here,

259
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,320
and then...

260
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,540
Wh-Who are you guys? Why are you here?

261
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,710
Lust, is it okay 
if I eat this old man?

262
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,610
Where did that miserable Cornello run away to?

263
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,270
That rotten false minister!

264
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,050
What is all this?

265
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,510
What went on here?

266
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,440
This is awful...

267
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,550
Minister?

268
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,130
It's a miracle...

269
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,980
You're sure it's not just another trick?

270
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,370
But they came back to life!

271
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:38,120
It seems that the Devil worked wickedness in my absence.

272
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,670
Is everyone all right?

273
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,930
You're the real... 
the real minister, right?

274
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,120
Cornello-sama!

275
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,120
We were deceived by that kid!

276
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,200
That's right!

277
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,610
Envy, I'm sorry, but we must ask you to keep that form for a little while.

278
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,300
We've seen all sorts of things.

279
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,520
I'm going to tell you about them.

280
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,640
You must not come down the same path as us.

281
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,050
That's what I believe.

282
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:32,970
We were born and raised in a small village east of Central named Resembool.

283
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,510
That's where everything began.

284
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,690
Mom!

285
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,730
Mom, look, look!

286
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,070
See?

287
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,160
Oh, my!

288
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,380
Brother made it!

289
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,580
I can still only do this.

290
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,320
Incredible, both of you!

291
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,540
You certainly are his children!

292
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:06,500
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

293
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:11,370
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

294
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,890
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

295
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:23,570
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

296
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,700
With you always in my sight, I can manage to draw breath

297
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,700
itsumo no shisen ni kimi ga ite kokyuu ga dekiru

298
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:43,100
And for me, that ought to be enough in itself, and yet...

299
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:43,100
boku ni totte nara sore dake de mou juubun na hazu na no ni

300
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:51,000
All little old me ever does is repeat the same old mistakes

301
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:51,000
chippoke na boku wa kurikaesu ayamachi bakari

302
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,460
How much strength do I need to come by

303
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,460
dore hodo tsuyosa wo te ni shitara

304
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,430
before I can get by without hurting anything?

305
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,430
nanimo kizutsukezu ni sumu no?

306
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,960
I am not going to stray, I'm going to trust this love,

307
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,960
mayowazu ni kono ai wo,

308
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,770
and with it I will go on living!

309
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,770
shinjikite yuku

310
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,330
I'm going to take these wounds,

311
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,330
fusagaranu

312
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,020
the ones that will not close, and squeeze them tight!

313
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,020
kizuguchi mo gyutto dakishimete

314
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,280
The two of us must keep on walking,

315
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,280
futari wa arukitsuzukeru

316
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,160
The two of us must keep on walking,

317
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,160
futari wa arukitsuzukeru

318
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,250
since we can never return again

319
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,250
ato ni wa modorenai kara

320
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:29,300
Even now, deep within my heart,

321
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:29,300
ima demo kono mune no oku,

322
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:35,250
I still feel the pain of this indelible sin

323
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:35,250
kesenai tsumi wa itamu kedo

324
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:35,510
Darling

325
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,600
Darling

326
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,340
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

327
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,960
Mother...

328
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,910
Mother...

329
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,980
Mother...

330
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,980
Episode 3: "Mother..."

331
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,960
I loved Mom's lullabies.

332
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,240
Mom's stew tasted like milk, but Brother loved it.

333
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,990
That's why we had to...
