00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:04,830
Central · Old District

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:04,830
Central · Old District

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:09,940
What's wrong?

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,970
I'm wondering if 
everyone else is safe.

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,860
There are a lot of people in the east 
who have the same skin color as you,

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,450
so I think they were 
able to slip in.

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,850
However, you are seen as the 
instigator of the rebellion in Liore.

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,170
That looks like the temple of the Lord Leto, back in Liore.

9
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,890
It is from an even older religion.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,520
It's no longer being 
practiced now, though.

11
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,790
Yes. They only recognized one god

12
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,490
and considered all other gods 
to be heathen.

13
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,740
It's said they had 
a lot of believers.

14
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,380
Many people died because of it. 
A great many.

15
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,440
That's awful. 
Religions exist to save people.

16
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,330
People cannot become gods, after all.

17
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,730
There, there. It's all right.

18
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,550
Why did you let 
those two get away?

19
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,380
It was <i>your</i> duty to eliminate the brothers, wasn't it, Sloth?

20
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,950
You too, Wrath.

21
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,960
I'll get them next time.

22
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,670
You defied that 
certain someone's word.

23
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,420
Sloth, don't you want 
to become human?

24
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,170
Yes, I do.

25
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,890
After all, I was born 
to become human.

26
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,350
I don't have any other goal.

27
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,920
They're here.

28
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,960
The Philosopher's Stone.

29
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:32,090
Those who obtain it are set free from the Law of Equivalent Exchange.

30
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,020
There is no need to pay a price 
in order to obtain something, either.

31
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,770
We sought it and found it.

32
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,060
The reason I want to spit these creaky old memories out

33
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,060
kishinda omoi o hakidashitai no wa

34
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,840
The reason I want to spit these creaky old memories out

35
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,840
kishinda omoi o hakidashitai no wa

36
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,230
is because I don't have any other proof of my existence

37
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,230
sonzai no shoumei ga hoka ni nai kara

38
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:10,580
The future that I thought I had grabbed hold of

39
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:10,580
tsukanda hazu no boku no mirai wa

40
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:16,080
is a contradiction of dignity and freedom

41
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:16,080
'songen' to 'jiyuu' de mujun shiteru yo

42
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:26,680
The reason I want to wipe away this distorted afterimage

43
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:26,680
yuganda zanzou o keshisaritai no wa

44
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,770
is because I see my own limitations within it

45
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,770
jibun no genkai o soko ni miru kara

46
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,070
is because I see my own limitations within it

47
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,070
jibun no genkai o soko ni miru kara

48
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:37,430
In the window of my overly self-conscious self

49
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:37,430
jiishikikajou na boku no mado ni wa

50
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,690
is last year's calendar, without any dates written in

51
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,690
kyonen no calendar, hizuke ga nai yo

52
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,740
is last year's calendar, without any dates written in

53
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,740
kyonen no calendar, hizuke ga nai yo

54
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:47,660
I'll erase it and rewrite it

55
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:47,660
keshite rewrite shite

56
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,280
with nonsensical surrealism

57
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,280
kudaranai chougensou

58
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,130
and an unforgettable sense of presence

59
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,130
wasurarenu sonzaikan o

60
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,340
Return from the brink of death, and rewrite it

61
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,340
kishikaisei rewrite shite

62
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,040
Even meaningless figments of imagination

63
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,040
imi no nai souzou mo

64
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,240
can be the driving force that gives you form

65
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,240
kimi o nasu gendouryoku

66
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,500
Give your whole body and soul to me

67
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,500
zenshinzenrei o kure yo

68
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,990
Hohenheim of Light

69
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,990
Hohenheim of Light

70
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,000
Why did you run off on your own 
without coming to me for protection?!

71
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,970
Elric brothers, what happened?

72
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,930
King Bradley is...

73
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,930
a homunculus.

74
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,680
By homunculus, you mean those...

75
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,210
man-made people, right?

76
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,440
Yeah.

77
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,890
They are covertly 
manipulating this country

78
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,900
in order to get a 
Philosopher's Stone.

79
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,400
That's not possible.

80
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,440
The Führer did not know what was taking place at the 5th Laboratory.

81
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,410
He also lamented the corruption within the military.

82
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,740
But I saw it!

83
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,920
The Führer had the 
mark of the Uroboros!

84
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,920
There was the one homunculus who can change his shape.

85
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,920
The Führer's secretary is also a homunculus.

86
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,300
And yet, she's an alien...

87
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,500
Supposing that the Führer and 
Secretary Douglas are homunculi,

88
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,810
what is their objective?

89
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,930
Why have they 
infiltrated the military?

90
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,530
I will send them back to Liore.

91
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,750
I'll come up with an 
appropriate reason

92
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,120
for them not to return to Central for a little while.

93
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,800
You do that. As for us...

94
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,690
You're going to Resembool, right?

95
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,290
Gentlemen, rejoice!

96
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,110
Our duties are at an end!

97
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,670
Major, what were you 
just talking about?

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,380
Were you listening to the melody 
being played by this body of mine?

99
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,660
No, not that...

100
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,140
Listen closely! 
Hear that? Hear that?

101
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,120
Um...

102
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,850
How is Lieutenant Havoc?

103
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,070
He's okay. He and Fuery 
were sent back ahead of us.

104
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,820
I see...

105
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,770
I'm sorry about all that.

106
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,820
Ed, your silver watch...

107
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,530
That's right. You can't be 
a State Alchemist anymore,

108
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,530
if what you said earlier is true.

109
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,640
No, it's not that.

110
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,720
I mean, it was taken 
from me by Archer.

111
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,700
Huh? Didn't Al-kun 
give it back to you?

112
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,550
I-I'm sorry! Brother, 
I don't have it anymore!

113
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,800
You lost it?!

114
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,930
N-No! Kimbly threw it at Scar-san,

115
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,560
and all the red stones inside it 
came spilling out.

116
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,130
Then they were absorbed into Scar-san's arm.

117
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,270
Why were there red stones inside my silver watch?

118
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,930
That miserable Archer.

119
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,780
He used that trick again, 
calling them transmutation amplifiers.

120
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,780
What?

121
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,120
Previously, in Ishbal, Brig. Gen. Grand 
supplied us with red stones.

122
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,760
Hold on, Colonel.

123
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,660
Then you knew that the military 
was making Philosopher's Stones?

124
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,870
And yet, you didn't 
say anything to me?!

125
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,040
When Marcoh deserted, 
I thought it had been discontinued.

126
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,920
Besides, it's not as though I knew that people were used as ingredients.

127
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,420
I can't trust you!

128
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,470
Brother!

129
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,290
You couldn't forget about those red stones,

130
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,780
so you tried to send us out to find them!

131
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,780
Stop it, Brother!

132
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,640
Enough already!

133
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,720
Brother!

134
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,940
Al!

135
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,190
Al can't go in the water!

136
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,190
Al! Al!

137
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,190
Al!

138
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,690
Yes?!

139
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,670
Brother! I can swim! 
I can swim, Brother!

140
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,820
You idiot!

141
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,180
Your bloodseal washes off if you're submerged in water, doesn't it?

142
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,710
Yeah...

143
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,190
Looks like I don't 
have to worry about that.

144
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,440
I wonder if that's because I really 
have become a Philosopher's Stone.

145
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,650
O-Okay, I get it! Come on!

146
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,740
What did you just...

147
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,120
It's nothing...

148
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,990
What...

149
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,200
did you just say about 
the Philosopher's Stone?

150
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,810
Nothing at all, nothing at all!

151
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:42,960
Okay, let's get going!

152
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,460
Brother! Wait!

153
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,550
Looks like the military 
hasn't arrived yet.

154
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,550
Huh? Sergeant Brosh?

155
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,410
He's in pursuit?

156
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,810
N-No, that's not it. Not him.

157
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,840
Brosh-san?

158
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,770
What's wrong, exactly?

159
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,610
Lieutenant Ross is... Lieutenant Ross is...

160
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,340
Your hair is as deep black 
as the feathers

161
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,960
of the great eagles I saw, so long ago.

162
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:27,330
I never thought I would see anything so beautiful again.

163
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,210
Your flattery is far too kind.

164
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:34,220
The Lieutenant, single-minded to her work, has gone absolutely sentimental over him!

165
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,870
Of all the things it could have been...

166
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,380
Good for her.

167
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,850
But who is she with, Brother?

168
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,390
Huh?

169
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,440
What are you flirting with her for?!

170
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,690
Edward-san!

171
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,820
You don't come home for umpteen years, 
and <i>this</i> is how I find you?!

172
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,690
You rotten old man!

173
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,910
Dad?

174
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,410
Yeah... Just like in the picture...

175
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,580
Dad!

176
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,670
It's Dad! It's Dad!

177
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:26,310
Um, you probably don't know who I am in this form,

178
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,700
but I'm...

179
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,600
Alphonse! You've gotten bigger, huh?

180
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,230
You know who I am?

181
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,980
Edward...

182
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,870
You still hate milk, don't you?

183
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:45,040
Who are you saying hasn't grown one bit since he was a baby?!

184
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,230
That's not what he said.

185
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:47,270
That's not what he said.

186
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:47,310
That's not what he said.

187
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:47,350
That's not what he said.

188
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,290
Are you sure, Edward-san?

189
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,700
I'm sure, I'm sure.

190
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,290
Don't get me wrong.

191
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,800
I was just listening to 
the stories of his travels.

192
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,800
Still, you did look like you were enjoying it.

193
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,160
Well, he is such a gentleman.

194
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,430
With a whiff of his cologne 
subtly carrying on the breeze,

195
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,390
he's not the type of man we get in the military.

196
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,520
Cologne doesn't suit me, anyhow...

197
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,040
Why are you acting so coy?

198
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,110
Cologne, huh? 
I hated that about him, too.

199
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:24,200
He left home 
soon after Al was born.

200
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,460
Mom always said he was off studying alchemy,

201
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,080
but he never once 
even sent us a letter.

202
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:38,070
And yet, the scent of that cologne he wore 
always permeated the house.

203
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,510
Earlier, when I saw Lyra in Liore,

204
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,000
she was wearing perfume that had the same scent.

205
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,630
You saw Lyra-san?!

206
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,360
Then she must have safely 
gotten away from Dante-san's place!

207
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,600
Just a moment, if you please.

208
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,280
This Lyra-san—what kind of 
relationship do you two have?

209
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,440
Oh, sorry.

210
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,360
Winry-san, what are you... 
Why are you holding that wrench?

211
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,360
I'm sorry.

212
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,910
The Führer is married,

213
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,000
and he also has children.

214
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,570
Above all else, I've seen pictures of him when he was younger.

215
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:22,220
Homunculi do not take on the form of humans when they are born.

216
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,400
When they are given red stones as a source of nourishment,

217
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,100
they get their own unique powers, as well as their form.

218
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,230
They use people's lives as food?

219
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,480
They can probably alter their appearance 
little by little, to make it look like they are aging.

220
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,980
His children could be adopted.

221
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,200
However...

222
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,910
whatever the case, 
he's a homunculus.

223
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,910
How do you mean?

224
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,350
You said they were making red stones 
in the 5th Laboratory, right?

225
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,850
Homunculi cannot use alchemy.

226
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,770
Yet how is it that they can 
teach others how to make them?

227
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,470
You mean, there's someone who raises them and controls them?

228
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,680
Still...

229
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,180
even though they are homunculi,

230
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,560
the country is managing 
to get on all right,

231
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,930
and the military is functioning.

232
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,940
We need not concern 
ourselves with them.

233
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,940
Why is it that the homunculi can't use alchemy?

234
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,450
Because they come from 
the other side of the gate.

235
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,450
But let's not talk about that. Tell me all about Trisha,

236
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:35,120
as well as everything you guys have been struggling through.

237
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,460
Dad...

238
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,410
I can tell just by looking 
at your body. You guys—

239
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,510
There isn't anything to talk about.

240
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:50,410
Our alchemy failed, and we lost our arms, legs, and bodies. That's all.

241
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,020
Edward, alchemy is not something—

242
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,620
Shut up! Don't you come home now and try to put on a fatherly face!

243
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,090
Mom waited for you 
that whole time!

244
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,650
Al, get in here!

245
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,360
Brother!

246
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,360
Brother, I'm sleeping with Dad.

247
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:08,850
Al...

248
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,370
Let's go, Dad.

249
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,130
I wonder if I can get my body back 
with the Philosopher's Stone.

250
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:30,840
You could attach your soul to someone else's body with the Philosopher's Stone.

251
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,750
Someone else's body?

252
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,920
That's not what I meant. I...

253
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,470
Your own body was lost in an equivalent exchange.

254
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,000
You must have given up your body as the cost of obtaining something else.

255
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,430
Something else?

256
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,170
If you return all of that, 
it will come back.

257
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,990
So then, if we can defeat that homunculus...

258
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,400
Nothing, nothing!

259
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,080
You're amazing, Dad! 
You know what?

260
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,890
There's something 
I want to ask you.

261
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,810
Okay.

262
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,080
Dad?

263
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:27,990
If I'd known this, I would have 
beat him up even more yesterday.

264
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,270
Stop joking around, and hurry 
and come look for him with me!

265
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,960
I bet he's just gone off on 
some other journey again.

266
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,820
Fine, then I'll go by myself.

267
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,240
Hold it!

268
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,960
You can't leave here 
for a little while.

269
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,340
We just got word from Warrant Officer Falman, who was waiting at the train station.

270
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,550
The search party has arrived.

271
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,420
We're going to go over there and send them back.

272
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,900
You sure you want to be harboring wanted men?

273
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,140
It's not as though I believe every aspect of your story.

274
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,450
I plan on ascertaining the truth 
about the Führer in my own way.

275
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,650
And if you find out 
that it <i>is</i> true?

276
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,330
Now then...

277
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:40,180
Well now, how about you go down 
into the underground cellar for me?

278
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,550
No, that's okay!

279
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,190
You too.

280
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,230
Where could Dad have gone?

281
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,180
You be quiet. More importantly,

282
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,710
how does the Colonel intend to 
find out who the Führer really is?

283
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,310
His secretary could only have been around for about four years, right?

284
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,180
Right.

285
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,100
If you mean Juliet Douglas,

286
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,960
she's supposed to have been in the military 
for at least fourteen years.

287
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,420
There's no way that could be true.

288
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:14,270
I'm sure of it. After all, she was 
the cause of the Ishbalan Civil War.

289
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,930
Yeah, you mean when that soldier accidentally shot a civilian?

290
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,780
That was a lie.

291
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,680
The cause of the outbreak of the war in Ishbal

292
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,890
was manufactured by 
a secret military squad.

293
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,410
They couldn't have...

294
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,040
So that's it! Ishbal was also used for a Philosopher's Stone.

295
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,940
If they could drive 
the Ishbalans to war...

296
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,370
...then maybe there was someone

297
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,400
who would make a Philosopher's Stone 
using the Grand Art.

298
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,050
Would they go that far?

299
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,790
The homunculi were behind it all.

300
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,640
So that's it. And Hughes-san 
must have realized that much

301
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,390
and was killed for it.

302
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,190
Jerk us around, will you?! Colonel, you bastard!

303
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,190
Hold on, Ed! What's the matter?!

304
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,400
It's Lt. Col. Hughes!

305
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,900
That was right after 
we left Central, wasn't it?!

306
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,800
The bastard! 
And yet, he kept us in the dark!

307
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,660
Did you know about this?!

308
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,620
I'm sorry. I just found out 
about it myself not long ago.

309
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,120
In any case, 
please go back inside!

310
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,100
You've got to be joking! 
If Lt. Col. Hughes was killed,

311
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,630
then it was our fault!

312
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:36,230
And yet, he didn't even...

313
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,510
That's enough!

314
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,910
It's not as though he didn't tell you 
just to be mean, you know.

315
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,520
I heard about this man Hughes.

316
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,800
I understand he was good to you.

317
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,940
But Mustang-san doesn't want you 
to be thinking about revenge.

318
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,170
Maybe he was trying to say that you had 
something more important to do.

319
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,790
Even so...

320
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,640
I've had it all wrong 
this whole time.

321
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,400
I thought the Colonel didn't care what had happened to Brigadier General Hughes.

322
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,630
But maybe...

323
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,830
I'll become distinguished... 
the most important in the country...

324
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,350
That was Mustang's 
promise to him, after all.

325
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,750
In order to do that,

326
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:30,630
he sought for ways to get promoted, rather than dwell on personal feelings such as revenge.

327
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,600
The Colonel sure is an adult, huh?

328
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,310
How can that be?!

329
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:38,260
Someone dear to him was killed, and he knows who the culprit is.

330
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,970
Yet there's something even more important to him than avenging his friend's death.

331
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,570
Is that the way that adults act?!

332
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:48,620
You became a dog of the military 
in order to achieve your goal, didn't you?

333
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,330
That bastard. 
I really do hate him.

334
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,340
Someone's coming!

335
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,900
Don't be ridiculous. 
This place is—

336
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,390
Who is it?

337
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,800
How good of you to come.

338
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,110
Unfortunately, the master is out.

339
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,230
Is that the body of 
the girl named Lyra?

340
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,770
Well perceived, 
Hohenheim of Light.

341
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:27,620
Sure enough, you were unable to forget me.

342
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,320
I heard her name 
from my sons.

343
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,370
But even if I hadn't, 
I would've known right away

344
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,540
from the scent of 
your perfume.

345
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,700
Have you come here to 
help me out, or something?

346
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,750
No, quite the opposite, Dante.

347
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,140
Gluttony!

348
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,010
I'll eat you!

349
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,600
I'm scared!

350
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,860
This one doesn't use a 
transmutation circle either.

351
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,570
There's nothing to be 
afraid of, Gluttony.

352
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,840
He has lived far too long 
in that body.

353
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,070
He must be near its limit.

354
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:15,320
I am near my limit, it's true.

355
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,710
But the same thing 
goes for you too.

356
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,660
Even if you can hide your 
decaying body with clothing,

357
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,950
you cannot disguise the smell.

358
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,430
Hohenheim...

359
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,230
Dante,

360
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,610
do not mislead 
my sons any further.

361
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,060
If you will promise me that,

362
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,560
I will tell you the reason why 
your body has started to decay.

363
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:48,060
It looks like they successfully turned the military away.

364
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,570
I guess so.

365
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,380
Huh? Where's Ed?

366
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,530
He said there was something he had to do alone.

367
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,090
Forgive me...

368
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,670
Forgive me, Mom...

369
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,220
As my tears well up,

370
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,220
afuredasu namida nara

371
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,390
I don't have to stop them now

372
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,390
ima wa tomenakute ii

373
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:17,710
I don't have to stop them now

374
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:17,710
ima wa tomenakute ii

375
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,500
At the end of all the grief,

376
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,500
kanashimi no saigo ni wa

377
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,380
the light is sure to shine through

378
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,380
hikari ga sashikomu hazu

379
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:33,370
Stay... stay... stay... stay...

380
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:42,680
It's true, I cannot see you now,

381
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:42,680
sou, ima anata ni aenai kedo

382
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,780
but by hiding the heartache,

383
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,780
setsunai omoi kakushite

384
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,900
I can become stronger

385
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,900
tsuyoku nareru,

386
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:58,220
And I will go on making sure of that

387
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:58,220
motto tashikameteyuku no

388
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,730
As my tears well up,

389
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,730
afuredasu namida nara

390
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,460
I don't have to stop them now

391
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,460
ima wa tomenakute ii

392
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,230
Nor will I forget the pain

393
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,230
yasashisa ni kawatteku

394
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,490
as it becomes kindness

395
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,490
itami mo wasurenai

396
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:14,930
as it becomes kindness

397
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:14,930
itami mo wasurenai

398
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:22,630
That which I ruined in my haste,

399
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:22,630
isogisugite kowashitekita mono

400
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,710
I will take back so that

401
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,710
torimodosu no

402
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:33,130
I can walk on as I would

403
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:33,130
watashirashiku aruku tame ni

404
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,860
for you

405
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,550
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

406
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,920
A Rotted Heart

407
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,870
A Rotted Heart

408
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,940
A Rotted Heart

409
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:44,480
Episode 45: "A Rotted Heart"

410
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,360
Al,

411
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,630
I'm going to fight.

412
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,400
You don't have to do 
anything more now.
