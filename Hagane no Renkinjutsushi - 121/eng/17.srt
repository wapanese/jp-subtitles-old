00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,800
It's all so peaceful.

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,080
It's extremely rural, huh? There's nothing here.

3
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,580
It's been four years.

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,650
Has it been that long?

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,960
You haven't been back home once?

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,420
You can't come home to a place where you've got no family waiting for you.

7
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,750
Major, you've heard about 
our general situation, right?

8
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,600
Mm-hmm.

9
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,000
Well, this is a surprise.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,440
Winry! Winry!

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,450
We have honored guests!

12
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,010
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

13
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,600
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

14
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,650
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

15
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,980
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

16
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,120
Ready, steady, can't hold me back

17
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,470
Ready, steady, give me good luck

18
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,770
Ready, steady, never look back

19
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:47,170
Let's get started, ready, steady, go!

20
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,320
The landscape blows on by me

00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,290
Grandma Pinako...

62
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,290
It's been a long time. 
I need your services again.

63
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,300
Oh, my...

64
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,160
You've really done quite a number on yourselves this time, huh?

65
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,990
Well, a lot has happened.

66
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,960
And yet you've gotten so small...

Objects of

00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,440
Who are you calling small, you Minimum Hag?!

72
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,770
Now you've said it, you pipsqueak!

73
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,770
Shut up, you bean sprout hag!

74
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,580
Micro-pipsqueak!

75
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,260
Flea-sized hag!

76
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,270
Edward Elric!

77
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,100
How can you speak 
that way to your elder?!

78
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,700
I, Armstrong, will remedy this!

79
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,160
Who are you?

80
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,490
You don't get the joke, huh?

81
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,370
Alex Louis Armstrong.

82
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,120
Pinako Rockbell.

83
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,720
Brother!

84
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,970
Why, you! Winry!

85
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,360
Are you trying to kill me?!

86
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,430
What about you?! What the heck did you get so messed up for?!

87
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,160
Good grief! What were you doing to wreck my very best Automail,

88
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,320
that I put my heart 
and soul into making?!

89
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,200
Yeah, well, it came apart so easily...

90
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,500
Al's busted up beyond recognition too!

91
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,000
You guys were up to something dangerous, weren't you?!

92
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,200
Well, you see...

93
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,290
Hey, Pipsqueak,

94
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,520
you've grown a little taller, 
haven't you?

95
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,790
You didn't have to say "pipsqueak"!

96
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,380
Which means, your leg 
needs to be adjusted as well.

97
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,460
We'll have to build 
a new arm from scratch.

98
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,640
Can you manage all that 
in a week or so?

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,200
We're in a hurry.

100
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,140
Don't underestimate me. 
I'll have it done in three days.

101
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,150
Sorry about that, Granny!

102
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,050
But what are you 
in such a rush for?

103
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,850
We'd like to get back to Central as soon as possible.

104
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,130
We're looking for 
something important there.

105
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,190
It's not anything dangerous, right?

106
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,020
No...

107
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,570
It's not anything like that!

108
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,620
Jeez,

109
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,520
you guys never make anything but trouble for me...

110
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:26,090
Winry may complain, but she's still always there for us, huh?

111
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,450
Yeah...

112
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,650
It may just be a spare, but there sure is something different about how Granny makes them.

113
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,400
You know something,

114
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,180
things haven't changed 
around here, have they?

115
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,820
Nope.

116
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,450
Armstrong-san, was it?

117
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,960
What kind of lives are 
those boys living every day?

118
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,860
As rural as we are here, we don't get much information about the city,

119
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,720
and those boys haven't 
sent me one letter.

120
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,010
I worry about them.

121
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,910
The Elric brothers—

122
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,770
particularly the Fullmetal Alchemist—

123
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,920
are well known around Central.

124
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,740
As a result, they do sometimes get drawn into trouble.

125
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,060
But they are all right. 
Those brothers are strong.

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,740
Strong, huh?

127
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,540
Help my brother!

128
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,000
Just bear with us.

129
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,230
This pain is nothing...

130
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,630
We have to get back to Central quickly

131
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,760
and find that material on the Philosopher's Stone.

132
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,200
That's true, but why don't you take it easy for now?

133
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,690
Once we go back there, 
things are going to be hard, after all.

134
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,430
Maybe so, but it still bothers me to just sit around doing nothing.

135
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,070
Brother...

136
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,680
Go pay a visit to Mom's grave.

137
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,530
Visit her grave, huh?

138
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,470
We're leaving as soon as your Automail is fixed, right?

139
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,290
So now's the time.

140
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,920
I'll stay here.

141
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,490
You're right.

142
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,550
I guess I'll be back in a bit.

143
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,100
I'm finished splitting the firewood, 
Madam Pinako.

144
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,640
Thanks a bunch.

145
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,110
You can take it easy for as long as you're here too, you know.

146
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,330
No, as a soldier, 
my daily training is essential.

147
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:52,100
By the way, I haven't 
seen Edward around.

148
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,450
He said he was going to visit his mother's grave.

149
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,380
I told him that going out 
on his own was dangerous.

150
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,620
It's all right.

151
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,500
He has a first-rate escort 
along with him.

152
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,260
Oh? Ed! You're back?

153
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,380
Yeah! It's been a while.

154
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,860
Four or five years, isn't it? 
And yet you're still so stunted, huh?

155
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,230
Don't call me stunted!

156
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,410
Say, are you still working 
as a State-whatever-it's-called?

157
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,460
Sure am.

158
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,700
Take care of yourself. 
You're so stunted, and all.

159
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,490
Stop saying I'm stunted!

160
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,020
What's the matter? 
You're just spacing out.

161
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,450
Mm-mm... 
Winry, that girl over there...

162
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,050
Oh, you mean Nellie.

163
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,050
When we were kids, 
we used to play a lot together, huh?

164
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,760
Hide-and-seek, 
and going down to the river...

165
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,360
Something the matter?

166
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,180
Mm-mm...

167
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,690
I just couldn't remember her face...

168
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,970
Sure. She's changed 
quite a bit after all, huh?

169
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,110
I guess so...

170
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,390
Al...

171
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,330
Let's...

172
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,750
bring Mom back.

173
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,080
Ready to go back, Den?

174
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,200
Is that one of those watches?

175
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,930
Hm? Yeah. It has some workings that boost your power when transmuting—

176
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,210
How cool!

177
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,040
The loving workmanship, the edging...

178
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,870
This is truly the work of a craftsman!

179
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,210
How do you set it? 
Do you wind it by hand?

180
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,380
Or is it self-winding? 
Or could it possibly be—

181
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,960
Beats me. I've never worried about it.

182
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,680
Please! Let me examine it!

183
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,650
You've gotta be kidding! 
If I let you have it,

184
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,440
I know you're going to take it apart to the very last screw!

185
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,580
That's okay, right?

186
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,690
After I analyze it, I'll put it back together the way it was! Okay?

187
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,100
No way. Get someone else's.

188
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,070
Well now, I think I'll go chop a year's worth of wood...

189
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,070
Bleh! Jeez, you guys are stingy.

190
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,080
Al...

191
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,360
Granny says my arm 
should be finished tomorrow.

192
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,590
Once that's done, 
the first thing I'll do is fix you.

193
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,590
Mm-hmm...

194
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,300
Brother, did I ever have any friends?

195
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,310
Huh? What's this, all of a sudden?

196
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,560
My memory is all hazy.

197
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,020
I can't remember the faces of any of my friends.

198
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:16,360
Well, you know, your memory is something where, one after another, things pile up.

199
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,050
It's only natural that things from the past will fade.

200
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,280
I wonder...

201
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,130
Listen, Al...

202
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,630
There's something...

203
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,730
I've been meaning to say to you for a long time...

204
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,430
but I've been too scared... 
and I haven't been able to say it.

205
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,470
What?

206
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,890
It's just...

207
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,440
Tell me.

208
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,650
Nah... never mind.

209
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,110
Brother!

210
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,110
Young men!

211
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,820
Look at this beautiful night sky!

212
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,560
The brilliance of the whole sky!

213
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,580
It is a blessing from Heaven not visible from the city.

214
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,200
This is a nice place—
this village of Resembool.

215
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,090
To make up for 
not having anything,

216
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,950
it has many things that the city does not have.

217
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,020
Long ago, we used to gaze at the stars like this a lot, huh?

218
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,530
Mm-hmm...

219
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,070
And now, the moment you've been waiting for, docking time!

220
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,860
It's the moment when the nerves connect that gets me each time.

221
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,580
Don't complain. You want to 
hurry back to Central, don't you?

222
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,060
Well, sure. I'd like to get 
my original body back soon

223
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,260
and say goodbye to this pain.

224
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,450
That's too bad. 
We make a killing on you.

225
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,990
She's right. You needn't force yourselves to go back to the way you were.

226
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,810
The smell of oil, the creak of the artificial muscles,

227
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:09,370
the hum of the bearings... 
Isn't Automail wonderful?!

228
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,540
Lousy machine fanatic.

229
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,370
What was that, 
you transmutation fanatic?!

230
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,230
Okay, here goes. One...

231
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,230
two...

232
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,730
three!

233
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,100
You two, move aside! 
We're going to lay Ed down there.

234
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,480
I had no idea the pain is so great when you attach them.

235
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,000
Even a grown man will scream out.

236
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,480
It's no small matter.

237
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:50,930
How is it? I tried to make the weight of the steel 80% less than before.

238
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,520
We can't have it be so heavy that you don't grow any taller, right?

239
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,610
Look, you...

240
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,240
Don't go talking about people's heights when they're in such pain.

241
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,780
If you've still got that much pluck, 
you'll be fine.

242
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,250
Is it all working okay?

243
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,040
Yeah.

244
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,140
Since it's less heavy, 
its strength has dropped as well,

245
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,370
so make sure you don't do anything reckless.

246
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,360
You can always replace Automail, but you only have one life.

247
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,290
Right.

248
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,200
I'm feeling a little lightheaded 
after working through the night.

249
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,190
Thanks, Winry.

250
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,660
The charge for the rush job 
won't be cheap!

251
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,900
Al!

252
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,120
Are you okay now, Brother?

253
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,640
Yep! Perfect!

254
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,480
That's terrific!

255
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,140
I'll fix you up right away.

256
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,480
These are all the 
fragments of the armor?

257
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,110
Mm-hmm, the major and the others were careful to pick them all up.

258
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,900
You'll be repaired right away?

259
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,860
You do have to 
know the hang of it.

260
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,980
There's a seal in there, see?

261
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,580
That serves as the intermediary 
between Al's soul and the armor.

262
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:05,290
It was a close one, huh? If I had been gouged just a little bit deeper...

263
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,790
No matter what else happens, 
that part has to be safeguarded.

264
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,920
That's the critical area that keeps Al tethered, after all.

265
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,810
It looks like it was 
drawn with blood.

266
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,320
Yeah, that's my blood. 
I drew it pretty frantically.

267
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,310
What?!

268
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:21,850
What amazing brotherly love! Such an incredible bond!

269
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,850
Could you stand back? You're in my way here.

270
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,780
Here goes!

271
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,410
This feels great!

272
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,680
Brother, thanks!

273
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,800
All right! So, should we do the usual?

274
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,170
The usual?

275
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,050
Yeah.

276
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,320
Our teacher always told us

277
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,280
that in order to train the mind, you must first train the body.

278
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,660
Al and I always spar 
with each other.

279
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,530
However, I've never ever 
beaten him once.

280
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,220
In that case, I will assist you!

281
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,070
Thanks anyway.

282
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,750
All right, here goes!

283
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:39,070
Hey, don't get crazy 
and break it again!

284
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,430
Good grief...

285
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:46,180
They're all absorbed in themselves. What a couple of children...

286
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,120
Next up is me!

287
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,300
Custom-made articles sure are magnificent!

288
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,330
What polished form! 
What curious workmanship!

289
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,230
It must be incredible on the inside too! 
I'd sure like to see it!

290
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,630
I'd sure like to take it apart! 
I'd sure like to put it back together!

291
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,830
Ed?

292
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,030
Hee hee...

293
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,600
Why, you!

294
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,190
You're too soft! You'll never get any further like this!

295
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,650
Brother!

296
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,950
Dammit!

297
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,950
This is...

298
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,670
What's the matter? 
Is that all you've got?

299
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,520
We got him!

300
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,120
We got him, all right!

301
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,080
Winry?

302
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,340
What's the matter?

303
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,810
I'm sorry. I had a look...

304
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,400
Look, you!

305
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,400
I'm sorry.

306
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,400
I'm so sorry.

307
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,900
For the love of...

308
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,500
I haven't even shown it to Al.

309
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:00,830
I'm sorry.

310
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,230
It's so sissy of me...

311
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:10,980
having to carry my 
admonition toward myself

312
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,510
and my resolve around 
with me in this fashion.

313
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,490
Ed...

314
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,930
Even so,

315
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:19,260
we don't have any parents, 
or a house to come home to.

316
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,090
All we can do is move forward.

317
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,050
Why?! How come?! 
You have a home, don't you?!

318
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,110
You have Grandma 
and me, don't you?!

319
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,670
That's crazy talk.

320
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,770
What are you crying for?

321
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:41,910
You brothers won't cry yourselves, so I'm crying for you.

322
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:53,040
Where could Ed and 
the others have gone?

323
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:00,450
Hey, they'll be back here in no time. Just wait for them like we always do.

324
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,600
This was the entrance... and the living room...

325
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,980
On cold days, we'd put wood in the fireplace.

326
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,370
Brother always skipped 
cutting the wood.

327
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,810
Whenever we were 
late getting home,

328
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:37,700
Mom would flash a lamp 
from the second-story window.

329
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,820
It was bright, and no matter where 
we were playing, once we saw that,

330
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,580
we would hurry home.

331
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,950
Come to mention it, that's right.

332
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,900
You two do have a home, don't you?

333
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,390
A home, with a warm family waiting for you.

334
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,660
Brother...

335
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,830
Over there...

336
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,240
Boys, come on by and 
eat with us once in a while.

337
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,040
Sure. We will, before long.

338
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,280
Granny, thank you.

339
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,080
Thank you for looking after us.

340
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,040
Come back soon!

341
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,930
Right!

342
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,700
Grandma...

343
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:07,370
I took a look inside Ed's watch.

344
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,690
Inside, he engraved...

345
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:16,270
the date on which they burned down their house and left.

346
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:26,940
You squeeze your right hand, as if to reassure yourself

347
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:26,940
tashikameru you ni nigirishimeta migite

348
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,790
Go on, take those annoying rules and dash them away!

349
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,790
uzattai housoku o buchikowashite yuke

350
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:36,930
If it comes down to having to rest your wounded feet,

351
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:36,930
kizutsuita ashi o yasumaseru gurai nara

352
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:41,820
you've gotta keep moving forward, if only just a step!

353
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:41,820
tatta ippo demo koko kara susume

354
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,590
We've pushed our way

355
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,590
through the twisting winds

356
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,590
yuganda kaze o kaki wakete

357
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,720
and gotten beyond the cold sky

358
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,720
tsumetai sora o oikoshite

359
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:58,490
Yet we still continue to wander

360
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:58,490
soredemo mada samayoi tsuzuketeru

361
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:06,660
We always find ourselves crying out

362
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:06,660
bokura wa itsudemo sakenderu

363
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:12,000
Just continuing to believe is not the answer

364
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:12,000
shinji tsuzukeru dake ga kotae janai

365
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,710
We must bare our weaknesses and wounds,

366
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,710
yowasa mo kizu mo sarake dashite

367
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:21,390
and continue to struggle,

368
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:21,390
or nothing will ever turn out!

369
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:21,390
mogaki tsuzukenakereba hajimaranai

370
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:29,090
Break on through to the other side of the door!

371
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:29,090
tsukiyabure tobira no mukou e

372
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:34,690
To the other side of the door!

373
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:34,690
tobira no mukou e

374
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,580
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

375
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,040
Marcoh's Notes

376
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,990
Marcoh's Notes

377
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,060
Marcoh's Notes

378
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,710
Episode 18: "Marcoh's Notes"

379
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,820
The first branch of 
the Central Library...

380
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:51,950
From the burnt ashes, 
a handful of truth rises.
