1
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,220
How long are we 
going to stay here?

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,070
I thought we were 
going to the border.

3
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,780
How should I know?

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,340
There will probably be many soldiers who will be confused and won't follow orders.

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,540
It will mean some sporadic fighting,

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,310
but we will keep the casualties to a minimum.

7
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,020
We are now going to 
return to Central.

8
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,280
With the troops we have at present, we will 
take control of the Central Command Center.

9
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,360
You're planning to 
stage a revolt?!

10
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,820
You'd rebel against the Führer?!

11
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,690
The Führer and those around him have used the country for their own purposes

12
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,390
and led us down the wrong path!

13
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,580
We'll take control of the Assembly at the same time.

14
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,390
But this is all so sudden, 
and without any evidence...

15
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,290
Evidence?

16
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,280
Here is your evidence!

17
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,050
There isn't a single flaw in this well-trained body of mine.

18
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,800
<i>This</i> is my evidence 
that my words are true!

19
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,520
Go on, go on, look at it! 
Touch it! See for yourself!

20
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,270
Go on, go on.

21
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,980
Go on!

22
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,840
The Philosopher's Stone.

23
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:34,990
Those who obtain it are set free from the Law of Equivalent Exchange.

24
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,860
There is no need to pay a price 
in order to obtain something, either.

25
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,650
We sought it and found it.

26
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,050
The reason I want to spit these creaky old memories out

27
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,050
kishinda omoi o hakidashitai no wa

28
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,830
The reason I want to spit these creaky old memories out

29
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,830
kishinda omoi o hakidashitai no wa

30
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:08,220
is because I don't have any other proof of my existence

31
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:08,220
sonzai no shoumei ga hoka ni nai kara

32
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,570
The future that I thought I had grabbed hold of

33
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,570
tsukanda hazu no boku no mirai wa

34
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:19,070
is a contradiction of dignity and freedom

35
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:19,070
'songen' to 'jiyuu' de mujun shiteru yo

36
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,670
The reason I want to wipe away this distorted afterimage

37
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,670
yuganda zanzou o keshisaritai no wa

38
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,760
is because I see my own limitations within it

39
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,760
jibun no genkai o soko ni miru kara

40
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,060
is because I see my own limitations within it

41
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,060
jibun no genkai o soko ni miru kara

42
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,420
In the window of my overly self-conscious self

43
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,420
jiishikikajou na boku no mado ni wa

44
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:40,680
is last year's calendar, without any dates written in

45
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:40,680
kyonen no calendar, hizuke ga nai yo

46
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,730
is last year's calendar, without any dates written in

47
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,730
kyonen no calendar, hizuke ga nai yo

48
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,650
I'll erase it and rewrite it

49
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,650
keshite rewrite shite

50
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,270
with nonsensical surrealism

51
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,270
kudaranai chougensou

52
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,120
and an unforgettable sense of presence

53
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,120
wasurarenu sonzaikan o

54
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,330
Return from the brink of death, and rewrite it

55
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,330
kishikaisei rewrite shite

56
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,030
Even meaningless figments of imagination

57
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,030
imi no nai souzou mo

58
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,230
can be the driving force that gives you form

59
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,230
kimi o nasu gendouryoku

60
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:11,490
Give your whole body and soul to me

61
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:11,490
zenshinzenrei o kure yo

62
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,980
Good-bye

63
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,980
Good-bye

64
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,400
Mama!

65
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,480
I restructured your water into ethanol.

66
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,490
It vaporizes at room temperature.

67
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,400
Well done...

68
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,850
Make sure you tidy up when you're finished...

69
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,980
Ed, Al...

70
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,050
Winry?

71
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,070
What's wrong? Did something happen in the village?

72
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,260
I came because I was concerned.

73
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,660
You finally took care of her, huh?

74
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,410
You're not her...

75
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,120
Al, you're the one I really love!

76
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,090
This is where it ends.

77
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,960
It's no use. 
I'm the Philosopher's Stone.

78
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,090
So I hear.

79
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,730
Well then, shall we try this out?

80
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,450
If you've become 
the Philosopher's Stone,

81
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,680
then you should still be perfectly fine 
if I destroy this here.

82
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,770
Stop! Don't you touch Al!

83
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,600
You don't have to worry.

84
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,480
I'm just going to carry him to you-know-who's place.

85
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,530
"You-know-who"?

86
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,030
The one Lust was talking about? The one who controls you

87
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,620
and for whom you're seeking the Philosopher's Stone to make immortal?

88
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,490
Maybe so,

89
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,630
although it's not as though you have absolutely nothing to do with that person.

90
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,880
By any chance, 
is the person above you

91
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,430
the one who deliberately 
enticed our mom

92
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,140
and did those things to her?

93
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,630
It couldn't be! There's no way Dad would do those things!

94
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,640
Okay, let's go.

95
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,610
Hey, you've got the wrong guy! 
Go slow <i>him</i> down!

96
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,860
That guy can do anything, right?

97
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,570
You're not allowed to touch him.

98
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,080
I can use him to bring Mama back! 
Isn't that right?!

99
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,180
Enough already!

100
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,250
Al!

101
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,380
This is your fault.

102
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,760
It's your fault that Mama is gone!

103
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,890
Stop!

104
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,680
Mama's gone! 
Mama's gone! Mama's gone!

105
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,890
She was your mama too!

106
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,780
Stop!

107
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,070
I don't have anything 
to do with you.

108
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,280
I'm the one you want to kill.

109
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,030
You're not my mama!

110
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,910
I've got nothing to do with you!

111
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,250
Sensei!

112
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,570
Are you okay?

113
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,470
He cried.

114
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,980
I couldn't bring myself to cry.

115
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,980
And yet, he did.

116
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,330
It's as if he was doing it 
on my behalf.

117
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,200
You've had enough. 
Right now, it's about Al.

118
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,880
I should be of some help, 
such that I am.

119
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,200
That's why I'm here.

120
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,720
Brother, we need to get going.

121
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,510
Hold on, hold on! 
That's Central for you.

122
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,680
There are lots of books here I've never even seen!

123
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,390
They've even got this?!

124
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,560
I can't wait to see Ed and Al.

125
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,560
And this too!

126
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,310
Don't you have enough?

127
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,260
<i>Uh-oh, if I pick these up, we won't be able to afford a room tonight.</i>

128
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,460
<i>But if I don't get them now, there's no telling when I can get them again.</i>

129
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,200
On my tab?

130
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,800
No, sir.

131
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,320
This shop specializes in books for our regular customers, the State Alchemists.

132
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,300
You couldn't understand 
what you'd read in these anyhow.

133
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,040
On... On my State Alchemist's tab.

134
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,050
To tell you the truth...

135
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,680
Brother?

136
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,800
Is this him? Edward Elric?

137
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,060
Yes, he definitely identified himself as the Fullmetal Alchemist.

138
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,090
W-Wait a minute! I was just joking around! I'm really—

139
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,730
Tell us all about it at 
the Command Center.

140
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,630
There are orders to place you in custody as soon as you're found.

141
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,900
Brother, what's going on?

142
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,240
Keep back, Fletcher!

143
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,430
It's his brother! 
The younger Elric brother is here!

144
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,280
Hold it! Come on!

145
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,240
Don't struggle!

146
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,260
Brother!

147
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,030
Huh? Was the younger brother the shorter one?

148
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,500
Well, of course he is!

149
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,160
What did you do, Brother?

150
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,950
Central is a scary place.

151
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,930
Lust...

152
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,820
You sealed the homunculus?

153
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,430
It wasn't me.

154
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,070
It was probably...

155
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:49,050
In any case, that means 
there are four of them left:

156
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:54,050
the child, the one who eats everything, 
the one who can transform into anything,

157
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,950
and the Führer.

158
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,450
And the one who's above them.

159
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,450
Who's there?!

160
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,320
Nina, say hello.

161
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,790
What's the matter? 
Are you bashful? I see...

162
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,170
Her soul didn't come back, then?

163
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,440
Nina, shall we play?

164
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,850
I know! Where's Alexander?

165
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,900
Where did Alexander go?

166
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,310
What are we going to do with him? 
Right, Nina?

167
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,780
Are you sure about this?

168
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,000
She's a soulless doll.

169
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,310
That is the form 
his sin has taken on.

170
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,270
He's going to go on living, 
embracing that.

171
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,320
That's good enough for me.

172
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,030
You've grown up, huh?

173
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,280
Grown up?

174
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:52,040
I was sure I grew up when I decided to become a State Alchemist.

175
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,820
Well then, what are 
you going to do?

176
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,300
I only know where one of 
the remaining homunculi is.

177
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,310
The Führer, King Bradley.

178
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,320
What are you doing?! 
Hurry it up!

179
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,520
We're completely surrounded.

180
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,830
There were even fewer soldiers 
who followed us than we expected.

181
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:36,240
Nothing we can do about that. 
The Führer's authority is absolute.

182
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,340
There aren't many officers who would go against it.

183
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,210
So, our new Brigadier General's plan was faulty.

184
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:46,060
No, Mustang's plan 
was to buy time here

185
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,740
and get Central's soldiers 
to head this way.

186
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,320
Right now, we just have to hang in there for a bit.

187
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,560
Maj—Lt. Colonel!

188
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,320
Are you sure about me presuming to act like this, when I'm not even Brigadier General Mustang?

189
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,570
Keep your chin up. 
I am here with you.

190
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,530
Besides,

191
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,820
it looks good on you.

192
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,040
No, you can't, Lieutenant Havoc...

193
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,750
Can I get you to keep 
your mouth closed?

194
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,600
Yes. This must be some important work you're doing, right?

195
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,260
It's a top-secret mission. Make sure you don't mention it to anyone.

196
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,260
Sorry.

197
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,060
Not at all...

198
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,710
What are you angry about?

199
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,620
I'm not angry.

200
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,270
Looks like Havoc and the others succeeded in making their move.

201
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,290
Yes.

202
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,530
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

203
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,650
Our whole force has to catch up to 
Brigadier General Mustang's division tonight!

204
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,650
Impressive, being able to organize your division as quickly as that.

205
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,570
I owe it all to your orders, Führer.

206
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,540
To think that you supposed that 
such a circumstance as this would arise!

207
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,600
It is now established that if Mustang and Armstrong are given some military force,

208
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,940
they are sure to launch a revolt,

209
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:09,060
which makes them agitators, 
the same as Basque Grand was.

210
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,640
I had to promote him to Brigadier General 
to make it look like I trusted him.

211
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,350
You men must have been 
quite discontent about that.

212
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:21,610
Of course not! We will put them down and return within a day or two!

213
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,090
Can I go home for the day?

214
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,880
Oh, some boys using the name of the 
Elric brothers were arrested this morning.

215
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,830
Hmm, let's see...

216
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,640
Dispose of them.

217
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,770
Why did you say 
you were Edward Elric?

218
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,840
What was I supposed to do? We don't have any money.

219
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,100
We have to give them 
this journal page from Dad.

220
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,600
Hide it!

221
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,040
Thanks so much for doing this.

222
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,090
Hey, when it comes to 
His Excellency's residence,

223
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,330
I had them put an 
extreme rush on it.

224
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,860
So, this is how the construction was completed?

225
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,840
Yeah, I don't do sloppy work.

226
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,840
Still, it was laid out really weird. Usually, a wine cave is...

227
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,070
I don't quite understand it myself,

228
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,050
but those were the Führer's secretary's instructions.

229
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,940
The secretary is on leave, 
so I am serving in her place.

230
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,700
Since you rushed to make the alterations, there's a little something extra in there.

231
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,560
Oh, there is, huh?

232
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,000
The Command Center 
sure is generous, all right.

233
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,900
The construction went according to schedule.

234
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,640
I can't say it's reliable, 
but this has to happen today.

235
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,820
What is it?

236
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,090
There's a rumor that the Elric brothers 
were arrested this morning.

237
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,680
At least find out if the Führer is 
here or not beforehand, would you?!

238
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,170
What could I do?!

239
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,480
Who knew he was going home early for his kid's birthday?!

240
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,440
There they are!

241
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,620
Don't make excuses!

242
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,350
Listen to reason!

243
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,240
Damn! Where did they go?!

244
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,900
Yow!

245
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,690
A-Are you okay?

246
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,700
You guys... The impostors?

247
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,290
It's Russell Tringham!

248
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,290
They were mistaken for you guys 
and got arrested.

249
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,960
It's a troublesome tale, what with 
this much difference in our heights.

250
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,430
What was that?!

251
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,430
Huh? Have you gotten even shorter than before?

252
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,710
What did you say?!

253
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,710
B-Brother, that was uncalled for!

254
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,760
Be quiet, Fletcher.

255
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,380
The Führer suddenly 
ordered them to be executed.

256
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,040
We thought that was too much,

257
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,170
and when we came to ask them what the situation was...

258
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,090
The commotion we caused allowed them to escape?

259
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:04,990
Are they there?!

260
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,480
Find them at once!

261
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,990
We finally meet again, 
and here we have to leave right away.

262
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,010
Where to?

263
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,770
The Führer's residence, perhaps?

264
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,240
If that's the only place left...

265
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,500
U-Um...

266
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,670
Here.

267
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,080
It's part of our dad's journal.

268
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,340
It has something from when 
he was in Central written on it.

269
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,340
Sensei!

270
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,740
Is this...

271
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
Wh-Who are you?

272
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,820
Frank...

273
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,150
Archer.

274
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,750
Edward Elric...

275
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,280
as well as the woman who got away 
from the Southern Command Center...

276
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,790
I'll take care of this. 
Go where it says in his journal.

277
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,020
Sensei...

278
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,790
Let me do something a teacher would do and get going!

279
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,880
You guys, too! Hurry!

280
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,890
From the looks of it, you didn't 
have to help out here after all, Colonel.

281
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,030
You think they're the sort who would just quietly stay captured?

282
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,160
We know better than that.

283
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,910
We're leaving.

284
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
Sorry, but I need your car—

285
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,760
Fullmetal?

286
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,550
Colonel?

287
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,340
Don't tell me you're here 
to capture me!

288
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,770
So, where are you going, Colonel?

289
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,040
The Wague District.

290
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,290
The Führer has a residence there.

291
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,570
What business do you have with the Führer?

292
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,020
I guess I don't have to ask. 
Still, it must be under guard.

293
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:23,080
Major Armstrong is staging a rebellion for me.

294
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:27,080
I doubt they would even think I was in hiding in Central.

295
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,510
You were going to 
distinguish yourself in battle

296
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,730
to rise to Führer, weren't you?

297
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:37,170
You also became a dog of the military 
in order to attain your goal. But then—

298
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,050
Lieutenant...

299
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,410
Just swallow all of the evil that 
comes at you and realize your dream—

300
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,140
that's what I thought 
the right way to do things was.

301
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,900
If you directly fight the Führer now, 
you won't be in the right.

302
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:56,010
Even if you do beat him, 
you'll never be able to be a leader again.

303
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,610
The masses won't acknowledge you.

304
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,160
Even so, I can't let that man 
get away with it.

305
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,780
You're going to avenge 
Lieutenant Colonel Hughes, huh?

306
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:11,440
Yeah. He must have known everything that was going on within the military.

307
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,100
You're going to throw away everything you've obtained up to now for this?

308
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,170
No great loss.

309
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,440
Isn't that true for you too?

310
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,680
You gave up being a dog of the military for your brother's sake.

311
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,320
You spat up the evil you've swallowed, trying to pretend you're an adult.

312
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,160
Both of us are trying like little children to be faithful in living out our dreams.

313
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,690
You're coming with me, right?

314
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,410
I tried working for the military, 
but I thought that wars are something

315
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,680
that somebody somewhere started 
and ended in some place unknown to us,

316
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,410
and that we didn't have 
anything to do with them.

317
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,190
But...

318
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,480
there's someone out there who manipulates wars to make Philosopher's Stones.

319
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,530
So as long as there are people 
who seek the Philosopher's Stone,

320
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,720
the wars will continue.

321
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,180
And the inclination to wage them 
is within all of us.

322
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,120
The homunculi fan the flames of war.

323
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,850
But it's human transmutation that creates them.

324
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:16,190
They're nothing more than what 
our hearts and wits made them to be.

325
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,080
And if that's the case,

326
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,600
then there's no such thing as a war we don't have anything to do with.

327
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,570
But that is too much 
for us to take on.

328
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:30,160
All you and I can do at any one time 
is what is before us.

329
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:37,390
I'm going to find this 
"you-know-who" person and defeat them.

330
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:40,200
Then I'm going to destroy the Philosopher's Stone

331
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,850
so that nobody will ever remember it again...

332
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,180
so that it will vanish from everyone's memories.

333
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,490
Destroy it?

334
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,880
The Philosopher's Stone? 
Then you really did complete it?

335
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,620
But then, does that mean...

336
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,180
He's not the one who brought about 
the Philosopher's Stone.

337
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,430
It was our hearts.

338
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,950
But that was your dream, wasn't it?

339
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,940
To use the Philosopher's Stone 
to take back what you had lost?

340
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:07,160
It won't help anything if it's just our dreams that come true.

341
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,660
There's something more important than your dreams, huh?

342
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,930
There always is.

343
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:19,560
Something more important 
than ourselves, or our dreams...

344
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,440
Farewell.

345
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,650
Good-bye.

346
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,220
As my tears well up,

347
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,220
afuredasu namida nara

348
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,390
I don't have to stop them now

349
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,390
ima wa tomenakute ii

350
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:17,710
I don't have to stop them now

351
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:17,710
ima wa tomenakute ii

352
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,500
At the end of all the grief,

353
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,500
kanashimi no saigo ni wa

354
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,380
the light is sure to shine through

355
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,380
hikari ga sashikomu hazu

356
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:33,370
Stay... stay... stay... stay...

357
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:42,680
It's true, I cannot see you now,

358
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:42,680
sou, ima anata ni aenai kedo

359
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,780
but by hiding the heartache,

360
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,780
setsunai omoi kakushite

361
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,900
I can become stronger

362
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,900
tsuyoku nareru,

363
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:58,220
And I will go on making sure of that

364
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:58,220
motto tashikameteyuku no

365
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,730
As my tears well up,

366
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,730
afuredasu namida nara

367
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,460
I don't have to stop them now

368
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,460
ima wa tomenakute ii

369
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,230
Nor will I forget the pain

370
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,230
yasashisa ni kawatteku

371
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,490
as it becomes kindness

372
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,490
itami mo wasurenai

373
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:14,930
as it becomes kindness

374
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:14,930
itami mo wasurenai

375
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:22,630
That which I ruined in my haste,

376
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:22,630
isogisugite kowashitekita mono

377
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,710
I will take back so that

378
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,710
torimodosu no

379
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:33,130
I can walk on as I would

380
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:33,130
watashirashiku aruku tame ni

381
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,860
for you

382
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,350
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

383
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,920
The Other Side of the Gate

384
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,870
The Other Side of the Gate

385
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,940
