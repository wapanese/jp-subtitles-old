1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,400
Kimbly!

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:05,980
Hey there.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,870
Well?

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,740
I'm going to take revenge for what you did to Greed-san and my friends!

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,410
Kimbly-san, 
what are you doing here?!

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,540
It shouldn't be that unusual, 
considering I <i>am</i> a State Alchemist, right?

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,980
You sold us out and returned to the military! You're the worst!

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,850
Are you sure you want to let her kill me like this?

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,710
Martel-san, please stop!

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,220
What are you doing?! 
Let go! Let go of me!

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,760
Are you all right?

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,760
Please stop!

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,880
Let go of me already!

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,770
You should make for some fine fireworks.

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,770
Martel-san!

16
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,240
Let go of me!

17
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,000
Kimbly-san, what are you doing to that man?!

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,270
I am, first and foremost, a soldier.

19
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,860
There's no reason why I should 
bear the blame of some hooligan.

20
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,720
Martel-san!

21
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,780
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,370
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

23
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:22,420
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,980
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

25
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:42,650
Far away, far away, our dreams will never fade

26
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:42,650
tooku tooku omoi hatenaku

27
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,950
If only the two of us could go back to

28
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,950
futari ga mujaki ni waratteta

29
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,800
the days when we laughed so innocently

30
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,800
ano koro ni modoreru nara

31
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,900
the days when we laughed so innocently

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,900
ano koro ni modoreru nara

33
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,730
Just like glassware

konagona ni kudaketa

35
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,330
that has been smashed to pieces,

36
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,330
glass-zaiku no you na

37
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:13,120
we're putting together the fragments of our memories

38
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:13,120
omoide no kakera o atsumeteru

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,910
It's the important things that you notice

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,910
daiji na mono wa itsudatte

41
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,730
It's the important things that you notice

42
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,730
daiji na mono wa itsudatte

43
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:24,480
once you've lost them

44
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:24,480
nakushite kara kizuku yo

45
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,730
Oh, please, oh, please, stop time for me,

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,730
douka douka jikan o tomete

47
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:37,310
and engrave the way you look right now into my heart

48
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:37,310
kimi no omokage o kono mune ni kizandekure

49
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:42,860
And if, and if, I were ever allowed to,

00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:42,860
moshimo moshimo yurusareru nara

51
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,270
I would be willing to sacrifice everything

52
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,270
subete o gisei ni shitemo ii

53
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:51,920
just to see that smiling face one more time

54
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:51,920
ano egao o mou ichido

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,030
The Scar

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,030
The Scar

57
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,040
And here I was hoping to see a really exciting explosion...

58
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,500
But thanks to your interference...

59
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,860
Please don't lay a finger 
on Martel-san.

60
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,810
By Martel, do you 
mean this snake here?

61
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,590
Martel-san is a person!

62
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,560
I wasn't aware of that.

63
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,890
These guys are Chimeras.

64
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,060
They aren't even 
full-fledged life forms!

65
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,940
Kind of like you.

66
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,480
You get away from Martel-san!

67
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,320
I'm not giving you 
the chance to transmute!

68
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,830
Al...

69
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,420
Now!

70
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,670
To think that you'd be deliberately providing me with ingredients...

71
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,940
Martel-san!

72
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,030
Why, you monster...

73
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,880
Colonel...

74
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,880
He, like his brother, 
is under my jurisdiction.

75
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,640
If you have any problems with him, you can file a written complaint.

76
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,390
Mark my words, I'm going to blow up that suit of armor.

77
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,480
You're going to the 
frontlines yourself, Führer?

78
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,010
I won't let Liore 
become another Ishbal.

79
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,930
Unless we bring an end to this quickly, with a minimum of casualties...

80
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,200
Y-Yes, of course.

81
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,260
I want you to take over 
as acting Führer.

82
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,600
Y-You want <i>me</i> to?

83
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,370
Don't let me down.

84
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,040
Yes, sir!

85
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,170
Acting Führer! Acting Führer!

86
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,150
Oh, and sorry, but could you send something to my wife for me?

87
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,030
She gets lonely 
all alone at home.

88
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,250
All right...

89
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,590
I'm counting on you.

90
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,520
Yes, sir!

91
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,990
Yet another city must fall...

92
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,600
for those who seek 
the Philosopher's Stone.

93
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,870
If you've come this far, then you must know what my objective is.

94
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,940
Yeah.

95
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,870
You must be thinking of doing something foolish, 
like creating a Philosopher's Stone.

96
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,960
I won't let you get in my way.

97
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,240
A Philosopher's Stone?

98
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,010
There's something I have to ask you.

99
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,870
Four years ago, back in Central, 
did you see a Chimera that looked like a dog?

100
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,010
I sent it back to God.

101
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,730
Why would you do that?!

102
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,800
What else would you 
have had me do?

103
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,150
That's not the kind of thing 
that we should be deciding!

104
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,400
Is that all you have to say?

105
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,550
Do you plan on wiping out Rose and the other people of this city

106
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,240
with that same self-serving logic?!

107
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,740
You know Rose?

108
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,370
I'm going to open your eyes!

109
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,020
How?!

110
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,250
Don't you know? 
You're an alchemist, after all.

111
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,220
I'm an alchemist?

112
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,820
Alchemy is comprised of

113
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,820
the three steps of comprehension, decomposition, and reconstruction.

114
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,930
You unconsciously read your 
opponent's metallic composition

115
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,870
and then adjust your own technique to destroy it.

116
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,040
That's why I've been replacing the metal of my Automail

117
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,000
with other metals besides steel.

118
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,380
So that's it.

119
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,740
Of course, rapidly swapping around the metal in my Automail

120
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,700
is messing up its 
delicate adjustments,

121
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,970
so I'm going to 
put you down quick!

122
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,660
You dimwit!

123
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:50,000
Once you use the lives of this town's people 
to make your Philosopher's Stone,

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,260
it will then be <i>your</i> turn to have vengeance taken against you!

125
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:58,290
Have you forgotten? 
I can also destroy living flesh.

126
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,330
Homunculi?

127
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,670
Call me Lust, please.

128
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,620
I'm Gluttony!

129
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,100
You understand why we're telling you our names, right, Fullmetal Boy?

130
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,510
Yeah, you mean that today, we'll be saying good-bye.

131
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,090
Ah, that was hot!

132
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,810
Don't kill us off so casually, if you don't mind.

133
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,370
Like you did to Greed.

134
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,090
And here we were protecting you,

135
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,530
scarred man of Ishbal.

136
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,210
I am your enemy, am I not?

137
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,300
If you're going to create a Philosopher's Stone,

138
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,690
then we will protect you.

139
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,060
We won't let the boy interfere, either.

140
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,890
Do you recognize this?

141
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,480
It is something you gave my brother.

142
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,110
What are you talking about?

143
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,730
Remember!

144
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,250
Lust?

145
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,120
Lust!

146
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,080
I hate you! I hate you all!

147
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,420
What's the story between 
you and that homunculus?

148
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,930
It's none of your business!

149
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,010
Wait!

150
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,020
Rose... and Lyra as well?!

151
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,970
"Please, listen to what 
that man has to say, Ed."

152
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,520
That's what Rose-san 
apparently wants to tell you.

153
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,440
Rose, you can't talk?

154
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,670
Keep it as a good-luck charm

155
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,320
so that even when I'm gone, you won't forget about me.

156
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,320
Back when Ishbal was still peaceful,

157
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,040
I had an older brother.

158
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,120
An intelligent brother, whom I was proud of 
and whom was respected by everyone.

159
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,750
My brother had a beautiful girlfriend.

160
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,350
She fell ill,

161
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,810
and soon after, she was called home to Ishbala.

162
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,360
Brother, what are you searching for?

163
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,250
The Grand Art.

164
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,700
It's a hallowed endeavor that can bring all people back to life.

165
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,680
That's what those people from Central recently tried to promulgate here—

166
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,920
what they called alchemy—isn't it?

167
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,250
They say that 
within the Grand Art,

168
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,920
there is a technique that 
brings people back to life.

169
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,280
I see...

170
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,180
So that's it. That explains it.

171
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,440
Brother! Brother!

172
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:23,390
My brother defied the teachings of Ishbala in order to bring her back to life.

173
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,950
He lost part of his body.

174
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,530
And yet, she still 
had not come back.

175
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,130
My brother was cast out.

176
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,960
The Grand Art was the greatest abomination in Ishbal, after all.

177
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,510
However, did my brother succeed after all?

178
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,720
That woman named Lust...

179
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,720
Do you know how 
homunculi are born?

180
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,760
People conduct human transmutation and fail.

181
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,730
The botched product that is born at that time is a homunculus.

182
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,490
Come to mention it, I heard about that from Dante-san as well.

183
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,600
She said she once committed human transmutation

184
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,860
and had created a homunculus.

185
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,310
That could have been Greed.

186
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,250
But they shouldn't be able to survive very long as they are.

187
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,490
Someone is gathering up 
homunculi like Lust and Envy,

188
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,960
giving them multiple lives, and controlling them.

189
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,510
Then Lust is the one 
my brother created?

190
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,980
She doesn't have a soul.

191
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,510
She's just a monster that 
has the same appearance.

192
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,790
Lust was affected by 
this good-luck charm.

193
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,310
Homunculi have a weakness when 
it comes to the remains of the person

194
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:40,230
who was the basis of their human transmutation.

195
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,480
Soon after my brother departed,

196
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,160
we were invaded for no reason.

197
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:55,870
We were angered by the 
sudden attack and rose up.

198
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:00,210
And so, a long conflict began.

199
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:03,670
I've learned a way to create a Philosopher's Stone.

200
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,260
Brother!

201
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,380
If we were to possess its power,

202
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,510
we could save Ishbal 
from its crisis.

203
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,700
In the middle of the war,

204
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,230
nobody rebuked 
my brother for returning.

205
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,050
However, just as my brother was about to complete the Philosopher's Stone,

206
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,880
he suddenly renounced his research.

207
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,780
I now know the reason why.

208
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,450
I also heard the story, 
from an outcast in Kishua.

209
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,460
It takes a large number 
of human lives

210
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,710
to create a Philosopher's Stone using the Grand Art as well.

211
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,240
That's right.

212
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,460
It probably takes so many lives

213
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,880
that it would mean the destruction of a whole town, or a whole people.

214
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:50,470
Unless the frustration, malice, 
and anger released at that time

215
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,430
all blend together,

216
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,390
a Philosopher's Stone 
cannot be formed.

217
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,720
In order to save Ishbal, 
we needed a Philosopher's Stone.

218
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,000
However, for that to happen,

219
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,110
Ishbal would have to be destroyed.

220
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,160
I am the State Alchemist in charge of the extermination of this district.

221
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,710
State Alchemist?

222
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,170
No more, please!

223
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,920
We have been driven from our land, 
and we are fleeing.

224
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,420
Isn't that enough?

225
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,530
I was just told to exterminate you.

226
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:32,220
I am to stamp out every last one of you who has eyes and skin of a different color.

227
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,270
Why?!

228
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,630
Who knows?

229
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,000
A light bulb just 
went off in my head.

230
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,570
I think I'll blow up your body, a little bit at a time.

231
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,490
First, I'll turn your skin 
into an explosive.

232
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,080
Whoops...

233
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,500
Next will be this arm.

234
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,910
Now then, next will be...

235
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,360
That body of yours looks like a transmutation circle.

236
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,780
I didn't know there were any alchemists in Ishbal.

237
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:24,270
However, we have these 
transmutation amplifiers.

238
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,810
Colonel Grand!

239
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,860
What the?

240
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,230
Brother!

241
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,550
Brother!

242
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,820
I commit the lives of our people 
within my body...

243
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,580
to you.

244
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,460
No! Brother, why did you do this?!

245
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,440
There is power within that arm.

246
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,510
If I had not done this, 
you would be dead.

247
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,170
Brother... Brother!

248
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,260
I have done something 
that cannot be forgiven.

249
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,850
You... liked her, didn't you?

250
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
Forgive me.

251
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,930
I am going on ahead... to see her, first...

252
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:05,580
Your brother was trying to transmute 
a Philosopher's Stone inside his own body.

253
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,800
He took the lives of the dying Ishbalan people

254
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,780
and entrusted them to you, together with his own arm.

255
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,760
The Philosopher's Stone itself possesses power.

256
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,050
That's how I managed to hold on to my life.

257
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,610
That arm itself is an unfinished Philosopher's Stone.

258
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:25,310
That's why it reacts 
with red stones.

259
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,650
It will take even more lives 
to complete it.

260
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,380
Which is why you're setting Rose up 
to be some charismatic leader

261
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,100
and manipulating 
the people of Liore?!

262
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,410
Hold on!

263
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:40,240
Scar-san is not going to 
sacrifice the people of Liore.

264
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,360
Lyra, what are you 
even doing here?

265
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,840
After Dante-san passed away,

266
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,990
I searched for a place where 
I could make my alchemy useful.

267
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,880
And then I learned 
of Scar-san's plans.

268
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,630
Just before the fighting begins,

269
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,620
the people are going to flee through an underground passageway

270
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,250
that has been made 
under the old church.

271
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,650
And then, the soldiers who have been lured into the city will be...

272
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,810
That means there will 
still be casualties!

273
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,710
Besides, how is it 
all right to kill soldi—

274
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,700
Do you know what 
they've done in this town?

275
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,180
What did the military do to Rose?

276
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,760
She was taken into 
the military's custody,

277
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,180
and when she came home, she had lost her speech.

278
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,780
Would you still ask us to forgive the military?

279
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,900
Martel-san, where are you?

280
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,200
This is a problem. 
I want to go pick up Brother.

281
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,910
Havoc-san!

282
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,540
What's the matter? 
Don't tell me there's an attack!

283
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,630
I don't know what's going on, 
but I heard that the Führer has arrived.

284
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,940
It pleases me that the Führer himself would call for someone such as myself.

285
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,940
There is a matter of some secrecy that 
I would like you two to lend me a hand with.

286
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:39,260
Lt. Col. Kimbly, I want you to take the lead of Tucker-kun's Chimeras and infiltrate the city.

287
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:44,410
I see, so you want us to run wild 
and provoke them into attacking?

288
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:47,450
The same trick that we used in the fighting at Ishbal.

289
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,870
But even if we don't 
go to all that trouble...

290
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:54,370
We will only act in order 
to restore peace.

291
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,630
If they're the ones who start it, 
we can say we're fighting for a just cause.

292
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:03,250
Also, there is still one 
State Alchemist in Liore, right?

293
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,970
Edward Elric?

294
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:09,600
He has probably been killed. Find his body for me.

295
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,350
That will make our cause 
even more just.

296
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:16,960
Even if I don't find his corpse, 
I will see to it that he becomes one.

297
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,440
A shame that 
we had to lose him.

298
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,500
I won't let you do it!

299
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,980
I won't let you do the same thing you did to Ishbal, nor will I let you kill Ed!

300
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,080
Come on, you're going to withdraw those orders!

301
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,830
Or else...

302
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,310
Your swift movements 
will not work against me.

303
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,520
I have the Mightiest Eye, you see.

304
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,400
<i>Ed! Al!</i>

305
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,610
Al!

306
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,830
Martel-san!

307
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,870
Al, listen to me, and tell Ed, too!

308
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,470
Whatever, just get inside me!

309
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,420
Al, listen...

310
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,380
Are you okay, Alphonse-kun?

311
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,950
I have executed the Chimera that appeared to be threatening you.

312
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,420
On the day you left,

313
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,420
On the day you left,

314
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,420

00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,420

I said good-bye and waved, like always

317
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:21,710
I said good-bye and waved, like always

321
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,930
Almost as if I would see you again
