1
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,160
So, Greed's dead, then?

2
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,740
Yes, and in a certain way, 
the way he died was just right for him.

3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,540
Unsightly yet beautiful in its violence.

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,570
Well, even if one of us is lost, 
you-know-who will just make another one.

5
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,130
Besides, we've located a new Wrath. 
Right now, Sloth has him.

6
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,090
I wonder what we should 
make him do...

7
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,770
What's wrong?

8
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,520
Don't tell me you're getting all sentimental over Greed dying.

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,770
Not really.

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,910
Something just crossed my mind.

11
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,400
Where do we come from, and where are we going?

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
What a load.

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,740
Patrons...

14
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,670
I'd like to close 
the restaurant soon.

15
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,390
We're alive here, now....

16
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,180
Listen, sir...

17
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,830
...and we don't 
need to go anywhere.

18
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,740
Isn't that enough for you?

19
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,980
Hey, are you listening to me?!

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,440
Shut up.

21
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,190
Can I eat him? Can I eat him?

22
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,090
Today, it's my treat.

23
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,920
Take your time.

24
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,170
Now that I think about it,

25
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,500
I've wondered about this before.

26
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,880
Where did I come from, and where am I going?

27
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,120
Stay with me! 
Stay with me, Jimmy!

28
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,330
Excuse me! 
Please let me through!

29
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,050
Please, let me 
take a look at him.

30
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,100
He'll be all right now.

31
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,730
Thank you so much!

32
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,240
Lust...

33
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,370
Lujon...

34
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,760
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

35
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,300
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

36
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,400
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

37
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,470
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

38
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:07,690
Far away, far away, our dreams will never fade

39
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:07,690
tooku tooku omoi hatenaku

40
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,990
If only the two of us could go back to

41
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,990
futari ga mujaki ni waratteta

42
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,840
the days when we laughed so innocently

43
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,840
ano koro ni modoreru nara

44
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,940
the days when we laughed so innocently

45
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,940
ano koro ni modoreru nara

46
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,770
Just like glassware

48
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,370
that has been smashed to pieces,

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,370
glass-zaiku no you na

50
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:38,160
we're putting together the fragments of our memories

51
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:38,160
omoide no kakera o atsumeteru

52
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,950
It's the important things that you notice

53
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,950
daiji na mono wa itsudatte

54
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,770
It's the important things that you notice

55
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,770
daiji na mono wa itsudatte

56
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:49,520
once you've lost them

57
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:49,520
nakushite kara kizuku yo

58
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,770
Oh, please, oh, please, stop time for me,

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,770
douka douka jikan o tomete

60
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:02,350
and engrave the way you look right now into my heart

61
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:02,350
kimi no omokage o kono mune ni kizandekure

62
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:07,900
And if, and if, I were ever allowed to,

00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:07,900
moshimo moshimo yurusareru nara

64
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,310
I would be willing to sacrifice everything

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,310
subete o gisei ni shitemo ii

66
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,960
just to see that smiling face one more time

67
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,960
ano egao o mou ichido

68
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,010
Fool's Reunion

69
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,010
Fool's Reunion

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,500
Brother, are you sure 
this road is the right one?

71
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,000
We're definitely 
heading south in any case.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,060
We'll come upon the 
Ishbalan camp before long.

73
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,720
I hope you're right.

74
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:52,020
But will you actually learn anything from asking the Ishbalans?

75
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,600
We don't have any other leads.

76
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,400
And I don't want to be manipulated by those homunculus guys.

77
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,730
Something the matter?

78
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,760
Just now...

79
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,240
I thought I heard 
a woman scream...

80
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,050
Lujon!

81
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,920
Who the hell are you?!

82
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,600
For crying out loud... Here you are, springing up right on time...

83
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,330
What was that, you little runt?

84
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,560
Why, you!

85
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,070
It's been two years, hasn't it?

86
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,670
I never thought 
I'd see you again.

87
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,720
I have so many things 
I want to tell you.

88
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,080
But before that, I wonder 
if you would tell me something.

89
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,960
Why did you disappear 
from before me?

90
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,870
Why did you leave 
without a word?

91
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,970
I don't remember. 
It was so long ago.

92
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,350
I remember! 
You taught me so many things!

93
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,180
Alchemy and something even more important.

94
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,120
What are you doing here? 
You've never set foot outside of the village.

95
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,690
O-Oh, I'm looking 
for a new Stone.

96
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,410
You remember, don't you?

97
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:31,290
Thanks to this Stone that you gave me, 
our village was saved.

98
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,660
But that disease has 
broken out again,

99
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,540
and this Stone's power 
seems to have gotten weaker.

100
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,710
Please...

101
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,000
Will you lend me 
your help again?

102
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,090
Once more, 
like you did before.

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,240
A mudslide, huh?

104
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,100
This sure is quite a disaster.

105
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,120
Can I eat them? Can I eat them?

106
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,830
Stop doing that. 
You should go on a bit of a diet.

107
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,940
Lucky girl, huh?

108
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,480
Here... Please...

109
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:17,660
Deliver these herbs to the village. Everyone is waiting for them.

110
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,210
Over there! There they are!

111
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,640
Hey, are you okay?!

112
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,300
Libia... Libia!

113
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,220
Stay with me, Libia!

114
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,190
I'm sorry, Lujon.

115
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,730
H-Here...

116
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,010
I told you not to do this!

117
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,890
This stuff won't 
do us any good!

118
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,770
I'm surprised. You guys must've been riding in the carriage too, right?

119
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,890
Even so, you'd best get away 
from here as soon as you can.

120
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,250
Fossilitis is spreading 
throughout this whole area.

121
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,530
Fossilitis?

122
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,910
I'll cure it.

123
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,350
I'm going to 
cure this with my...

124
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,130
with my alchemy.

125
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,130
So, you're traveling by yourself in order to find this man Lujon?

126
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,480
Yes.

127
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,140
I don't know what 
your reasons are,

128
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,390
but it's really not good for a woman to be out alone.

129
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,270
Still...

130
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,230
I'm worried.

131
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,400
With the way things are going, I get the feeling that I'll never see Lujon again.

132
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,800
So, why did this Lujon guy leave your village?

133
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,790
He left to search for 
a new Philosopher's Stone.

134
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,270
Philosopher's...

135
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,990
...Stone?!

136
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:39,990
Yes.

137
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,700
In order to cure the 
fossilitis in our village,

138
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,300
he needs the power of the Stone, 
no matter what.

139
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:52,600
It is a terrible disease, 
which no medicine has any effect on.

140
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,010
Which is the reason why Lujon...

141
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,690
Here, drink this. 
It will help you to relax.

142
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,020
Thanks.

143
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,150
From the looks of it, you weren't 
hurt that badly, for which I'm glad.

144
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,030
L-Libia!

145
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,150
What's the matter? 
Are you really hurt?

146
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,280
It's okay. My hand 
just slipped a bit.

147
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,030
Lujon! Lujon, are you here?!

148
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,120
My son... My son...!

149
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,880
This is fossilitis.

150
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,350
The body suddenly begins changing into something like stone or dry wood.

151
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:39,520
People die, almost like 
they are withering flowers.

152
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,000
Leave this boy, all that which is bringing calamity upon him.

153
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,600
Vasilisa, hear the cries of this boy.

154
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,070
Vasilisa, hear the grief of this boy.

155
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,260
Vasilisa, please accept this boy's prayer.

156
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,860
The enemy shall all be put to shame 
and flee in terror.

157
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,120
They shall withdraw at once and be reproached.

158
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,740
I'm sorry.

159
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,130
Anji... Anji!

160
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:18,460
He had... He had only 
just turned eight!

161
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,990
No!

162
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,660
I can't do anything! 
All I can do is pray to God!

163
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,540
Vasilisa, my god, 
I ask that with your power,

164
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,520
you please spare the little ones.

165
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,170
Please spare her!

166
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,170
Please, God... 
Ishbala, my god...

167
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,170
I ask that with your power,

168
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,920
you would please 
spare this little one.

169
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,920
Please spare them...

170
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:08,010
You're trying to use alchemy to 
take the dead parts of the body

171
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,390
and reconstruct them back into a normal body, aren't you?

172
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:15,220
Now that medicine won't work, 
you are not mistaken in your thinking.

173
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,160
However, you don't have 
enough experience with alchemy.

174
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,450
I will teach you...

175
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,450
true alchemy.

176
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,680
I'm so happy.

177
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,760
Who would've thought that you'd ever come to our village again?

178
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,770
I told them that I left the village to 
search for a new Philosopher's Stone,

179
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,600
but maybe I was 
actually looking for you.

180
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,260
I wanted to see you again too.

181
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,770
I've had this feeling 
for the longest time

182
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,640
that I left something 
behind in the village.

183
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,490
Don't worry about it.

184
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,070
We're heading in the same direction anyway.

185
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,770
Thank you.

186
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:15,090
But I'm not really sure it's right 
for me to go back to the village.

187
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,700
What choice do you have?

188
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,000
You may be out looking, 
but you don't have any leads,

189
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,510
so there's not much else 
you can do.

190
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:26,650
By any chance, is this Lujon-san fellow your boyfriend, or anything?

191
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,510
I...

192
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,520
was dumped by him.

193
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,970
I've been in love with him 
for a long time.

194
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,520
But the one he is 
really in love with is...

195
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,800
This is the place where you did your training, huh?

196
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,750
It does indeed look like you've at least got a lot of books together here.

197
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,200
What are you doing?!

198
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,920
Most of this is junk. First, you have to acquire the correct knowledge.

199
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,590
Read these in order.

200
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,590
Drill it all into your head.

201
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,100
It's no use. 
This is too hard for me.

202
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,880
I just can't do this!

203
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,360
It's okay. You can do it.

204
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,740
You have the talent. 
Come on, believe in yourself.

205
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,240
<i>There it is again...</i>

206
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,330
<i>Who is that?</i>

207
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,380
<i>Why do I have these memories?</i>

208
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,450
Yes, that's it.

209
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,200
What's this?

210
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,880
My gift to you. This Philosopher's Stone 
will increase your power.

211
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,360
You can't start off with trying to heal people.

212
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,280
Try using your power to 
return this bird to the skies.

213
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:44,740
May God save this creature 
and watch over it, never slumbering.

214
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,630
The Lord is this creature's keeper; the sun shall not smite it by day,

215
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,260
nor the moon smite it by night.

216
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,790
I did it!

217
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:04,510
Like I told you, 
you have the talent.

218
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,880
It's all because of you!

219
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,460
Thank you.

220
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,150
Could I ask you one more time?

221
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,440
Why did you disappear 
from before me?

222
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,150
You knew how I felt 
about you, didn't you?

223
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,460
You can't go looking 
for all the answers.

224
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,460
It will end up 
being your ruin.

225
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,720
I don't understand. 
What are you trying to say?

226
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,050
Please, don't take Lujon... 
Don't take Lujon away from me.

227
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,520
He and I are engaged.

228
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,670
Once my fossilitis is gone, we're getting married.

229
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,550
Isn't that nice? 
Congratulations.

230
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,430
If you invite me to the ceremony, I'll give a speech.

231
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,450
Please don't joke around! I'm being serious!

232
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,990
Libia,

233
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,140
I will use my power 
to heal you.

234
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,610
May God save this woman

235
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,970
and watch over her, 
never slumbering.

236
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,220
The Lord is this woman's keeper;

237
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,530
the sun shall not 
smite her by day,

238
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:43,980
nor the moon 
smite her by night.

239
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,030
Incredible... 
That's incredible, Lujon!

240
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,140
Cure my wife too!

241
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,280
Take care of my kid too!

242
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,780
You did it, Lujon!

243
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,930
How is it going?

244
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:13,140
Nothing to worry about. 
Everything is proceeding right on schedule.

245
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,490
I'm counting on you.

246
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,510
After all, that's the whole reason why 
we intentionally introduced this illness.

247
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,380
Lujon is starting to heal the disease with the fake Philosopher's Stone.

248
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,810
But that will only last 
for the time being.

249
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:30,270
Next, I will take away 
the power that I gave Lujon.

250
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:33,120
Then he will fall into 
the depths of despair

251
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,030
and start seeking out 
a genuine Philosopher's Stone.

252
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,240
And he'll be doing it for us.

253
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,900
We've been doing the same thing 
all over the place,

254
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,440
all to find us a person who can create a genuine Philosopher's Stone.

255
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,260
Excuse me...

256
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:57,520
Oh, Libia, you're even 
prettier than usual today.

257
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,010
Um, do you know 
where Lujon is?

258
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,890
It's just about time for 
the ceremony to start, isn't it?

259
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,020
I can't do it... 
I can't go through with it.

260
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:10,320
Alchemy isn't the only thing that you taught me.

261
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,400
There's something 
even more important.

262
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,900
I wonder what that could be.

263
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,540
I want you by my side forever.

264
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,620
Forever.

265
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:30,120
<i>Who... Who are you?</i>

266
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,710
You'd better go to her.

267
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,550
But...

268
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,260
Go!

269
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:44,740
Lust...

270
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,770
Hurry!

271
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:48,770
Libia!

272
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,750
Hey, are you sure about this? 
I'm afraid of Envy.

273
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,930
We're nearly at the village.

274
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,570
Hang on, everyone.

275
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,160
With this new power...

276
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,950
Over here! Over here!

277
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,200
Hurry!

278
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,570
You've saved us again,

279
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,460
like you did two years ago.

280
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,570
Do you remember?

281
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,730
That day, 
when I hugged you?

282
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,080
But this will be 
different from then.

283
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,580
I won't let you go 
this time.

284
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,840
Don't go!

285
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,890
Wh-Why?

286
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,090
You were my small...

287
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,560
blemish.

288
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:50,800
Where did I come from, and where am I going?

289
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,610
Lujon!

290
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,110
Lujon!

291
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,280
Lujon!

292
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,250
Lujon, where are you?!

293
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,110
Hey!

294
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,830
Libia-san!

295
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,430
This can't be...

296
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,960
Brother...

297
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,150
what in the world is this?

298
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,290
Hey... Hey...

299
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,890
Lust, I'm hungry. Hey...

300
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
On the day you left,

301
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
On the day you left,

302
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330

303
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330

304
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,620
I said good-bye and waved, like always

305
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,620
I said good-bye and waved, like always

306

307

308
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840
Almost as if I would see you again

309
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840
Almost as if I would see you again

310
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840

I want to be the sky for you,

I want to be the sky for you,

354
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,290
watashi wa kimi ni totte no sora de itai

355
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,290
watashi wa kimi ni totte no sora de itai

356
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,700
bundling you up, sorrows and all,

357
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,700
bundling you up, sorrows and all,

358
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,700
kanashimi made mo tsutsumikonde

359
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,700
kanashimi made mo tsutsumikonde

360
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,040
so that you know, whenever you look up, that you are not alone,

361
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,040
so that you know, whenever you look up, that you are not alone,

362
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,040
itsudemo miageru toki wa hitori ja nai to

363
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,040
itsudemo miageru toki wa hitori ja nai to

364
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:24,930
so that you know, whenever you look up, that you are not alone,

365
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:24,930
so that you know, whenever you look up, that you are not alone,

366
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:24,930
itsudemo miageru toki wa hitori ja nai to

367
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:24,930
itsudemo miageru toki wa hitori ja nai to

368
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:30,010
even when you're far away,

369
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:30,010
even when you're far away,

370
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:30,010
tooku de omoeru you ni

371
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:30,010
tooku de omoeru you ni

372
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,600
and that you have a place to come home to

373
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,600
and that you have a place to come home to

374
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,600
kaeru basho de aru you ni

375
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,600
kaeru basho de aru you ni

376
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,940
and that you have a place to come home to

377
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,940
and that you have a place to come home to

378
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,940

379
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,940

380
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,070
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

381
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,920
The Sinner Within Us

382
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,870
The Sinner Within Us

383
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,940
The Sinner Within Us

384
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:43,370
Episode 36: "The Sinner Within Us"

385
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:47,000
I think that anyone would be scared to see this mechanical arm.

386
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,320
Of course they would be.

387
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,530
However,

388
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,950
your heart isn't 
necessarily always right.
