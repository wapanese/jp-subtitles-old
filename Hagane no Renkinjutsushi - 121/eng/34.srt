1
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,090
Cut it out already! I've already told you everything I know!

2
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,580
I'm sorry, but we're under Lt. Col. Archer's orders.

3
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,670
Don't give me that! 
I'm in a hurry here!

4
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,950
Welcome, Crimson Alchemist, Zolf J. Kimbly.

5
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,350
As well as the Sewing Life Alchemist, Shou Tucker.

6
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,700
I've kept my end of the promise. 
Now for you...

7
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,950
I know.

8
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,560
There's nothing to be afraid of.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,470
I will secure your safety,

10
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,200
or my name isn't Frank Archer.

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,670
M-My safety?

12
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,850
That's right. You are going to return to the military

13
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,980
and continue your research, directly beneath me.

14
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,460
I can continue my research?

15
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,610
Yes.

16
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,960
Change of mission directives.

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,880
Show no mercy to anyone who opposes us.

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,400
Eliminate any troublemakers who are infesting this bar.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,030
B-But are you sure we should?

20
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,970
I don't care.

21
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,940
<i>As long as I have Tucker,</i>

22
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,210
<i>I can make as many of those 
sorts of guys as I want to, after all.</i>

23
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,910
<i>And Greed can't lay a hand on me 
as long as I have this.</i>

24
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,850
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

25
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,450
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,490
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

27
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,000
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

28
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:05,670
Far away, far away, our dreams will never fade

29
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:05,670
tooku tooku omoi hatenaku

30
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,970
If only the two of us could go back to

31
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,970
futari ga mujaki ni waratteta

32
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,820
the days when we laughed so innocently

33
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,820
ano koro ni modoreru nara

34
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,920
the days when we laughed so innocently

35
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,920
ano koro ni modoreru nara

36
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,750
Just like glassware

37
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,750
konagona ni kudaketa

38
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,350
that has been smashed to pieces,

39
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,350
glass-zaiku no you na

40
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:36,140
we're putting together the fragments of our memories

41
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:36,140
omoide no kakera o atsumeteru

42
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,930
It's the important things that you notice

43
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,930
daiji na mono wa itsudatte

44
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,750
It's the important things that you notice

45
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,750
daiji na mono wa itsudatte

46
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:47,500
once you've lost them

47
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:47,500
nakushite kara kizuku yo

48
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:54,750
Oh, please, oh, please, stop time for me,

49
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:54,750
douka douka jikan o tomete

50
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,330
and engrave the way you look right now into my heart

51
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,330
kimi no omokage o kono mune ni kizandekure

52
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:05,880
And if, and if, I were ever allowed to,

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:05,880
moshimo moshimo yurusareru nara

54
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,290
I would be willing to sacrifice everything

55
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,290
subete o gisei ni shitemo ii

56
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,940
just to see that smiling face one more time

57
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,940
ano egao o mou ichido

58
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,970
Theory of Greed

59
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,970
Theory of Greed

60
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,160
Dammit...

61
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,400
Those bastards!

62
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,640
Greed-san, this way!

63
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,050
Wh-What?!

64
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,550
My name is Alex Louis Armstrong.

65
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,060
People call me 
the Strong Arm Alchemist.

66
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,760
Major!

67
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,490
You will return...

68
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,110
Alphonse Elric to me.

69
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,740
My word... 
Sloth sure is a slave driver.

70
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,920
Then again, she was responsible for letting him escape,

71
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,380
so I guess she has no choice.

72
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,300
So, what will you do, Greed?

73
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,020
You see that?

74
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,860
That is the artistic alchemy that has been passed down

75
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,360
among the Armstrong family for generations.

76
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,030
You look like you're going to be a tough customer.

77
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,610
I'm going to have to 
mean business.

78
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,330
How bizarre...

79
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,050
It has been some time since my blood boiled and my muscles danced.

80
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,380
Impressive, Armstrong.

81
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,550
Your arms are as strong as ever.

82
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:19,860
I also participated in the battle to exterminate Ishbal, as a grunt.

83
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,620
You're a former comrade?

84
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,570
In that case, I have even less desire to take your life needlessly.

85
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,190
Surrender!

86
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,820
That is too much to ask.

87
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,920
Major! Please stand aside!

88
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,830
Major!

89
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,710
Do not throw your lives away!

90
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,710
Yeah, we're not going to.

91
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,070
What?

92
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,550
Tell Kimbly and Tucker for me...

93
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,050
that I will be sure 
to return the favor.

94
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,490
He sure is quiet,

95
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,630
especially considering 
how loud he was earlier.

96
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,000
He must have grown 
tired of carrying on.

97
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,560
I'm glad he has, myself.

98
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,420
Yeah, I guess so.

99
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,310
<i>So we're the only ones 
who got away, huh?</i>

100
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,360
<i>Damn!</i>

101
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,120
<i>Well then, what do I do now?</i>

102
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,370
How long do you intend to keep running away?

103
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,950
I think it might be 
too late for you.

104
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,710
You...

105
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,340
You've already seen 
Gluttony here, haven't you?

106
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,100
Pleased to meet you.

107
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,710
I'm the current Lust.

108
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,270
You?

109
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,720
To cut to the chase, Greed,

110
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,450
you've come to 
a fork in the road.

111
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,140
You can be sealed up again,

112
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,980
or you can be destroyed right here.

113
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,810
You think I can be 
done in by you?

114
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,960
Have you forgotten?

115
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,140
You, a homunculus, 
were sealed up by a certain someone

116
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,700
after rebelling 140 years ago.

117
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,200
That person is angry.

118
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,920
It's about time we brought this to an end, Greed.

119
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,460
An end! An end!

120
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,710
Sorry about this, boy, 
but you'll have to help us.

121
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,180
Take care of Martel.

122
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,050
Roa-san... Dolcetto-san...

123
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,930
H-Hold on, what's happening?!

124
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,550
Please go, Greed-san.

125
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,940
We'll take care of this.

126
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,480
Guys...

127
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,440
We can't afford 
to lose you here.

128
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,700
We'll leave it to you 
to avenge us all.

129
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,270
You sure are keeping some loyal pawns, aren't you?

130
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,750
I've been merged 
together with a dog,

131
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,890
and dogs have a strong 
sense of loyalty.

132
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,710
You cannot go beyond this point!

133
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,380
Greed-san!

134
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,690
Come on!

135
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,350
It's no use running.

136
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,850
You can tuck tail 
and run too, Dolcetto.

137
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,760
I'd like to do just that,

138
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,940
but these guys 
took a shot at me.

139
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,180
You're sure?

140
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,820
Too late to back out now.

141
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,070
Is that...

142
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,680
That's where 
Dante-san's house is!

143
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,890
For crying out loud, 
you sure are sociable.

144
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,550
You had the chance to run 
in the midst of all that trouble.

145
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,690
That's easy for you to say.

146
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,890
No matter. Hey, Martel...

147
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes?

148
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,290
Stay inside there until morning.

149
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:34,100
If I'm not back by then, 
you get away by yourself. Got it?

150
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,560
Greed-san! 
What are you planning to do?

151
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,900
Sorry about this, boy. 
That's how it is.

152
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,010
U-Uh...

153
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,620
Let me out! 
Open up, I tell you!

154
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,320
You can't! Greed-san 
said not to come out!

155
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,620
Shut up!

156
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,130
So I wound up 
coming back here after all...

157
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,750
I wonder why my legs 
brought me here.

158
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,140
Do they want me to 
beg her for my life?

159
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,640
Or something else?

160
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,150
That's a good boy, Greed.

161
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,100
This is just as you-know-who thought it would unfold.

162
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,400
We're done?

163
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,910
Yes. Our job is done here.

164
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,810
I'm hungry.

165
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,650
Who are you?

166
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,090
The reason you came here...

167
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,600
is because this is your birthplace.

168
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,730
Why, you...

169
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,010
Are those...

170
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,390
They're your bones.

171
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:21,150
Who are you? 
What did Dante tell you?

172
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,390
If it's Dante-sama you want, 
she's over there.

173
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,460
What's going on here?

174
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,270
It can't be...!

175
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:42,010
There's no way a kid like you can do something like this!

176
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,150
Who the hell is behind this?!

177
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,770
It couldn't be...!

178
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,280
Is that...

179
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,230
My...

180
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,410
My life!

181
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,700
Dammit...

182
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,580
I've found you, Greed!

183
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,020
Dante-san?!

184
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,140
Greed!

185
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,650
What the hell did you do?!

186
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:04,150
Good question. 
I'd like to know, myself.

187
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,650
Are you the one 
who killed her?

188
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,650
How about it?!

189
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,700
Well, makes no difference to me if you think so.

190
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,660
Why would you do 
something like this?

191
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,670
Why have you come this far 
to save your brother?

192
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,920
Al is my brother!

193
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,290
You're ready for this, are you?

194
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,980
Where is Al? Give him the hell 
back to me right now!

195
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,410
If you want me to return him,

196
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,930
then you know what to do.

197
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,530
Let me out!

198
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,950
I can't!

199
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,040
What's the matter?

200
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,170
Is that all the resolve 
you've got?

201
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,710
Correct me.

202
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,630
I'm an error, aren't I?

203
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,760
I told you before, didn't I?

204
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,520
If you want to defeat me...

205
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,270
...then fight with the intent to kill you, right?

206
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,270
That's right.

207
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:30,280
That's my mechanic for you. 
Even like this, I can still move it.

208
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,410
Let's go!

209
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,840
That didn't hurt one bit, kid.

210
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,840
This time, it's... <i>my</i> turn!

211
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,140
Wh-What the hell 
did you do to my shield?!

212
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,740
If you think about it, 
it's pretty simple.

213
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,740
You can't create something 
out of nothing.

214
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,960
In other words, you've got to be fashioning that shield thing of yours from someplace.

215
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,360
Even though you're a homunculus,

216
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,210
they say that the components of your body 
are still the same, don't they?

217
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,990
The substance within 
your body's composition

218
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,390
that can be converted into 
a very hard, durable material...

219
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:41,470
It's what comprises 
a third of your body: carbon.

220
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,820
The hardness changes depending on 
how the carbon atoms have been arranged.

221
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:50,690
From pencil leads 
all the way up to diamonds.

222
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:54,060
Once I know the structure, 
the rest is right up my alley!

223
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,510
Where is Al?

224
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,730
I haven't lost yet...

225
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,210
This fight is over, isn't it?

226
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,140
You heard from your brother, right?

227
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,590
I don't die all that easily.

228
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:21,140
Then I'll just have to hammer you until you decide you want to talk.

229
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:26,500
That's it! It wouldn't be fun 
any other way.

230
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,770
There's the kid I was hoping for.

231
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,780
Bring it on!

232
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,010
Here goes!

233
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,850
Nicely... done...

234
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,360
Where's Al? 
Where did you take Al?!

235
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,040
I let him go 
a long time ago.

236
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,930
Greed?

237
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,420
Homunculi...

238
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:37,630
are born when you alchemists 
perform human transmutations.

239
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,160
When we are...

240
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,330
brought before the bones of the person they attempted to bring back to life,

241
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,690
we aren't able to move freely.

242
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:52,020
That is the homunculi's 
Achilles' heel.

243
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,670
Why? Why are you 
telling me this?

244
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,920
Knowing you, 
you can defeat them.

245
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,990
I can't bear to let myself be sealed up again.

246
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,960
Greed... are you...

247
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,740
I am avarice, after all.

248
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,790
I will do with my life as I like.

249
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,710
Greed!

250
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:18,280
Defeat... them...

251
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,130
I'm counting... on you...

252
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,700
H-Hey... you're kidding, right?

253
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,540
Greed! Hey!

254
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,370
What are you doing?! 
Are you screwing with me?!

255
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,210
I thought I could knock your head off 
and you wouldn't die!

256
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,570
Hey! Greed!

257
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,730
What is this?

258
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,920
Martel-san...

259
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,880
Um...

260
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,740
Did my teacher say anything?

261
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,240
No. By the time I got here, she was already gone.

262
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,740
I don't know where 
Lyra went off to, either.

263
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,550
Sensei, I really am 
sorry about this.

264
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,960
We're going to Ishbal.

265
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,590
If we stayed by your side any longer, Sensei, we'd just be in your way.

266
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,610
Sensei, there's a possibility 
that the military is after you,

267
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,450
so could I ask you to go into hiding for a little while?

268
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:37,980
Of all the... If it's come to me being worried over by you, then it's all over.

269
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,520
You're going, 
no matter what I say?

270
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,480
Yes.

271
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,940
No matter what happens, 
we will continue our journey

272
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,770
until we get our own bodies back.

273
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,990
I'll see you later.

274
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,490
Right.

275
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,420
On the day you left,

276
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,420
On the day you left,

277
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,420

278
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,420

280
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:21,710
I said good-bye and waved, like always

283
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,930
Almost as if I would see you again

284
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,930
Almost as if I would see you again

285
