1
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,240
I wonder if the Philosopher's Stone 
would be in a desolate town like this.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,020
It almost seems like a lie that up until just recently, 
this town was prosperous from gold.

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,650
Which is why they would be that much more likely to research the Philosopher's Stone.

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,990
How do you mean?

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,980
Since they stopped being able to get gold out of the mines,

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,780
they'd want to transmute it with the Philosopher's Stone that much more.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,500
This used to be a gold 
producing area, and all,

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,550
so if they created just a little, 
no one would find them out, right?

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,100
It's terrible the way grown-ups think.

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,510
Elisa!

11
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,100
Hey, everyone, give me a hand here!

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,340
It's no use! It won't budge!

13
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,340
Papa...

14
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,230
It's all right.

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,400
We're going to help you 
out of there, no matter what!

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,990
What's the matter?

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,080
My daughter is pinned!

18
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,790
Just be patient for a bit, okay?

19
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,050
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

20
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,630
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

21
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:42,680
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

22
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:49,000
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

23
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:56,010
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

24
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:56,010
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

25
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:56,010
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

26
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:56,010
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

27
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:01,480
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

28
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:01,480
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

29
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:01,480
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

30
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:01,480
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

31
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:01,680
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

32
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:01,680
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:01,680
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

34
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:01,680

35
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,480
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

36
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,480
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

37
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,480
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

38
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,520
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

39
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,520
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

40
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,480
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

41
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,480
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

42
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,230
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

43
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,230
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,950
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

48
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,350
Looking at the sky, 
thinking tomorrow must be coming,

49
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,350
asu ga kuru hazu no sora wo mite

50
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:30,850
it's too much for my captivated heart to take

51
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:30,850
mayou bakari no kokoro mote amashite iru

52
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,600
As a bird flutters along beside me,

53
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,600
katawara no tori ga habataita

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,700
I wonder where he managed to find his light

55
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,700
doko ka hikari wo mitsukerareta no ka na

56
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,600
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

57
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,600
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

58
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,140
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

59
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,140
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

60
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,140
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

61
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,140
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

62
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:52,310
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

63
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:52,310
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

64
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:59,700
And leave me at the highest place there is,

65
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:59,700
And leave me at the highest place there is,

66
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:59,700
soshite ichiban takai tokoro de

67
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:59,700
soshite ichiban takai tokoro de

68
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,590
far away from kindness?

69
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,590
okizari ni shite, yasashisa kara toozakete

70
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:14,960
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

82
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,980
Land of Stones, Part 1

83
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,980
Land of Stones, Part 1

84
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,900
Wow, to think that an alchemist would come along!

85
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,660
You really came through for us!

86
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,370
Thanks to his armored father too!

87
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,250
No, no, we're brothers, actually. This is my younger brother.

88
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,130
Younger brother? Even though 
he's bigger than you, Big Brother?

89
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:06,040
Anyhow, we're glad that you weren't hurt, Elisa-chan.

90
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,000
Elisa!

91
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,600
Is Elisa all right?!

92
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,090
Uncle Belsio!

93
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,050
Papa?

94
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,230
Look, you...

95
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,250
How dare you 
come into my house!

96
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,440
After making Elisa 
help you out like that!

97
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,950
Listen to me, Elisa. 
No matter what anyone tells you,

98
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,130
you can't help Belsio out in his work anymore!

99
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,620
No!

100
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,530
It wasn't Uncle Belsio's fault! 
I asked him to let me help out!

101
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,510
I-I'm sorry, Elisa! 
Here, drink this.

102
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,470
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,330
Uncle Belsio told me...

104
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,950
that your lemon pies 
were the best, Papa.

105
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,970
And that it was a shame that there were so few farms left in town.

106
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:16,220
Hey now, once the Philosopher's Stone is finished, 
the town will become prosperous!

107
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,130
Then we'll be able to buy our fruit!

108
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,420
The Philosopher's Stone?!

109
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,210
Right, right!

110
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,720
You two came to assist 
Mugear-sama in his research, right?

111
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,650
To create a Philosopher's Stone?

112
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,050
Mr. Alchemist, please create the Philosopher's Stone as soon as you can!

113
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,060
We want to get back our town of gold—
Xenotime—no matter what!

114
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,690
We're depending on you, Master Alchemist!

115
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,190
It looks like there's a lot to this,

116
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,490
but in any case, I guess we'll go see this Mugear person.

117
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,490
By the way,

118
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,990
if you would please 
tell us your names?

119
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,660
Our names?

120
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,950
I'm Edward. Edward Elric.

121
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,960
H-His brother, Alphonse. 
Alphonse Elric.

122
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,510
The Elric brothers?

123
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,920
The State Alchemist ones?

124
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,510
Yeah!

125
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,670
What did you do that for?!

126
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:18,390
You hush! The real Elric brothers are already up there!

127
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,110
Come back when you've decided to be honest about your real names!

128
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:49,280
Who is it that's been 
using my name here?

129
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,750
Brother, are you really planning to sneak in?

130
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,140
Course I am!

131
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,190
I'm going to catch that impostor

132
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,390
and have him tell me about the Philosopher's Stone while I'm at it.

133
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,670
Brother? Was that...

134
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,160
A transmutative reaction.

135
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,020
Look at this. This is all material on the Philosopher's Stone.

136
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,920
So, this is where they're making 
the Philosopher's Stone, all right.

137
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,410
No doubt about it.

138
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,920
This place is off-limits to unauthorized persons.

139
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,430
By any chance, are you guys...

140
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,050
There you are, you impostors!

141
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,180
Which would mean that 
you're the real Edward, huh?

142
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,690
No! No! I'm Edward! Me!

143
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,150
You're the older brother?

144
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,360
Got a problem with that?!

145
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,740
Don't get so excited.

146
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,980
The security guys will 
realize you're here.

147
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,450
What do you know, the real 
younger brother wears armor, huh?

148
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,600
You sure don't look like you're fourteen.

149
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,460
You know about us?

150
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,530
What, you want to go at it?

151
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,460
If you guys will go home quietly, I don't plan on fighting.

152
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,490
Just let us stay here 
for a little while longer.

153
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,300
Is that any attitude to be asking somebody for something with?

154
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,750
Sit.

155
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,720
Stop looking down on me!

156
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,360
That would bother you, huh?

157
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,860
Being only that tall, 
when you're fifteen?

158
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,740
Automail, huh? The real one 
has his troubles too, it seems.

159
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,590
By saying that,

160
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:45,770
you sound as if you haven't just been living in idleness yourself!

161
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,310
I'd like to have a look at the skill of a State Alchemist.

162
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,190
You're gonna be sorry you did!

163
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,020
Not bad. No transmutation circle, huh?

164
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,630
The impostor doesn't use 
a transmutation circle either?!

165
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,200
Why, you!

166
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,450
Have you got a Philosopher's Stone?!

167
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,480
What was that noise just now?!

168
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,650
This way!

169
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,240
Damn! I ache all over.

170
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,650
That impostor sure was strong, huh?

171
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,180
It was just the Stone's power, after all.

172
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,670
So, I wonder if they've completed a Philosopher's Stone yet.

173
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,190
We're going to 
make sure we find out.

174
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,350
I wonder what those 
brothers' names are.

175
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,910
The two of them must 
have real names, after all.

176
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,250
I wonder if the older brother is older than you, Brother.

177
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,540
Don't go judging us 
just on our size!

178
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,630
Brother, let's give this up already.

179
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,480
If those two report what's really going on, what will we do?

180
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,550
Don't worry. Nobody is going to believe what they say.

181
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,560
Let's hurry and complete the 
Philosopher's Stone and leave town.

182
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,560
I hope it goes that smoothly.

183
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,570
I'm not about to let Mugear get the credit for the research Dad spent his whole life on.

184
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,510
But...

185
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,780
Don't worry.

186
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,280
If it comes to that, I'll make sure that 
no matter what, at least you get away.

187
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,520
Brother, you don't understand.

188
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,830
That won't...

189
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,570
make me happy...

190
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,310
Are you sure you should just be standing there like that?

191
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,780
You're here, are you?

192
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,960
It seems some outsiders have appeared.

193
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:17,260
Y-Yes, but not to worry. 
The Elric brothers have been chased away.

194
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,440
I'm not so sure.

195
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:24,450
Those boys could prove to be extraordinarily crafty.

196
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,020
But then, having come to this point,

197
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,960
it's only a matter of time before the military comes to learn of the research.

198
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,340
I think that maybe it's about time you pulled out, Mugear.

199
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,620
Please don't say that!

200
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,670
Just a little more time, please!

201
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,100
I promise you, I will complete the Philosopher's Stone!

202
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:45,680
Hurry.

203
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,060
Use any means that you have to.

204
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,940
It's starting to swell up pretty good.

205
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,640
Your coldness feels so good.

206
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,050
I'm happy to be of use to you, Brother, even in this body.

207
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:17,230
You were at the store this evening.

208
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,380
If you have no place to stay, come to my place.

209
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,390
Thanks for helping us out.

210
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,220
I couldn't let you children 
sleep outside.

211
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,100
You're not going to 
ask us our names?

212
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,860
You're the Elric brothers, right?

213
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,250
Then, you believe us?

214
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,130
No.

215
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,860
I just think that everyone has their own reasons.

216
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,240
I'm not the one who bears responsibility for them.

217
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,970
That's up to you.

218
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,950
You don't appear to have any interest in the Philosopher's Stone, huh?

219
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,470
The folks in this town

220
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:58,460
are still unable to forget the wealth that gold has brought them,

221
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,960
and Mugear has them 
wrapped around his finger.

222
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,980
Good morning, Uncle Belsio!

223
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,210
If you keep coming to my place, 
you're going to get yelled at again by your pop.

224
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,730
No problem, no problem!

225
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:23,300
Papa is all wrapped up in talk about the gold mine. He won't notice.

226
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,990
Good morning.

227
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,420
Big Brothers, you're here!

228
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,860
Wow, that looks like it hurts!

229
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,130
That's what you get 
for telling lies, huh?

230
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,550
I'm telling you, we're not the ones who are lying.

231
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,600
And yet <i>I'm</i> the one 
who gets clocked!

232
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,250
You don't mean, you're the ones who snuck into Mugear-sama's mansion yesterday, Big Brothers?

233
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,220
Of course it was us! We can't let those impostors get away with this, you know!

234
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,020
And besides, using a Philosopher's Stone to make gold is no small matter.

235
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,030
Brother...

236
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,480
I'm going to go see 
what's happening in town.

237
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,650
Brother!

238
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,520
Hey, big guy!

239
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,480
Yes?

240
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,490
Would you go to 
the drugstore for me?

241
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,200
I'd like for you to get 
Elisa's medicine,

242
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,690
and your brother needs a compress too, right?

243
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,670
Say, it's that armor. 
He's that impostor!

244
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,380
Oh, dear! I wish he would hurry up and leave.

245
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,260
I'll bet it was those boys who broke in 
to rob Mugear-sama's mansion last night.

246
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,010
Hey, you!

247
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,640
What have you come here for?!

248
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,550
I-I need to get some medicine...

249
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:41,350
We don't have any medicine 
that treats liars! Go on! Go on!

250
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,250
I give up. I can't buy 
any medicine like this.

251
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,950
Um...

252
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,650
You...

253
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,370
I'll go buy your medicine for you.

254
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,110
An equivalent exchange...

255
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,560
to apologize for us lying.

256
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,580
Here.

257
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,120
Thank you very much.

258
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,680
Both of us have it hard when our older brothers act rash, huh?

259
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,930
Aren't you angry?

260
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,930
You must have your reasons, right?

261
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,710
I'm sorry.

262
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,230
For us to participate in Mugear-san's research,

263
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,000
we needed to use 
names such as yours.

264
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,920
To be a child <i>and</i> 
a State Alchemist—

265
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,300
the Elric brothers are 
the only ones around.

266
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,200
You need the Philosopher's Stone that badly?

267
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:36,910
It's something my dad spent his whole life researching.

268
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,250
Then, your father was an alchemist as well?

269
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,000
Mm-hmm.

270
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,290
But then, one day, 
he was suddenly gone.

271
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:50,800
That's why my brother is forcing himself to carry on after our dad.

272
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,800
That's the complete 
opposite of our family.

273
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,810
My brother hates our dad, 
who was also an alchemist.

274
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,700
Our dad was completely absorbed in alchemy,

275
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,900
and our mom suffered because of it.

276
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:12,070
We've also seen a bunch of other people who have met with sadness because of alchemy.

277
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:17,280
Listen, if your brother is doing something wrong,

278
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,290
you're the only one 
who can stop him.

279
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,270
You can't make others do it.

280
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,600
If you do, I think your brother will be deeply hurt.

281
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,460
I've been a little concerned about this,

282
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,400
but aren't there a lot of people coughing around town?

283
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,310
U-Uh-huh.

284
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,270
Is this cough medicine, then?

285
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,960
I-It's...

286
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,730
Brother!

287
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,380
Sorry, I have to go now.

288
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,100
Hey, what's your name?

289
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,970
Fletcher!

290
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:05,920
Brother?!

291
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,390
What's the matter?

292
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,010
The impostor is here! 
The older one! Have you seen him?

293
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,510
Nuh-uh.

294
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,610
That bastard! What a hypocrite!

295
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:20,370
He's been fixing the townspeople's hoes and transmuting wheels for them!

296
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,770
That's better than having him do bad things, though.

297
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,770
I don't like the way he operates!

298
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,350
He's ignoring the Law of Equivalent Exchange!

299
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,850
Al, we're going to 
sneak in there again tonight!

300
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,110
Even though it's the very next day?!

301
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,610
<i>Because</i> it's the very next day!

302
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,620
Brother...

303
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,620
There's something 
I want to talk about.

304
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,050
Today, we're going with 
the mole-man strategy!

305
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,250
Mole-man?

306
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,580
All right, we should be just about under the building now.

307
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,500
Are you sure?

308
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,570
Well, we're going to 
come out somewhere.

309
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,750
We're here!

310
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,670
What is this?

311
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,050
Could it be...

312
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,050
This might be the water that forms the base of the red stone.

313
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,360
The red stone?

314
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,000
I read some documents about it 
at the library in Central.

315
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,830
It's a stone, made of a compound of roughly the same material

316
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,770
as the Philosopher's Stone, 
which you get by refining red water.

317
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,380
Then, you can make a Philosopher's Stone from this water?

318
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,530
Apparently, it won't be the 
exact same thing, but yeah.

319
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,030
As I remember, some alchemist named Nash-something-or-other was researching it,

320
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,750
but in the end, it didn't work out.

321
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,200
Brother?

322
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,100
For some reason, I suddenly feel...

323
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,300
Brother! Brother!

324
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,840
Over here!

325
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,500
Who's there?!

326
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,840
It's me! Quickly!

327
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,840
Hurry up!

328
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,340
Fletcher...

329
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,850
Brother, are you all right?

330
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,350
Huh? Where am I?

331
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,730
What are you doing here?!

332
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,240
I-I'm sorry...

333
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,300
What? What are you crying about?

334
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,740
Fletcher...

335
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,830
If you know something, tell us.

336
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,130
You really don't like 
what's going on here, do you?

337
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,900
That red water...

338
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,340
It's water that's very 
dangerous to humans.

339
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,650
But it's vital for creating a red stone.

340
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,600
You mean, the people in town are also coughing because of that?

341
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,720
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

342
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,730
Jeez, this is ridiculous.

343
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,510
I'll just smash all of this up.

344
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,360
I can't let you do that.

345
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,240
We've finally raised up 
a red stone this far.

346
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,500
My dad sacrificed himself for this.

347
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,500
If his experiments go unfulfilled, he'll never be redeemed, right?

348
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,000
What's so great about that half-baked rock?

349
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,050
That sword is just a fake too, right?

350
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,550
I'm going to mess you up, together with your rock!

351
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,980
Mine is the genuine article!

352
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,530
What?!

353
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,530
It's the red water.

354
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,800
If you're showered with it, 
you're done for.

355
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,000
You won't just lose consciousness!

356
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,500
Fine!

357
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,590
Brother! This is crazy!

358
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,430
Your brother is right! 
Get out of here!

359
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,800
No way!

360
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:28,430
I'm not going to lose to someone who's chasing after his own pop!

361
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,990
Fletcher!

362
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,910
Fletcher, hang in there!

363
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:57,740
Brother, Dad was 
researching the red water

364
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,180
to bring happiness to people, right?

365
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:05,380
And yet what we're doing is making 
the people in town suffer, aren't we?

366
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,970
Brother, you should've known this!

367
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,100
It doesn't matter who 
gets credit, does it?

368
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,920
Dad...

369
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,600
Dad would not be happy about this!

370
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,700
With you always in my sight, I can manage to draw breath

371
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,700
itsumo no shisen ni kimi ga ite kokyuu ga dekiru

372
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:43,100
And for me, that ought to be enough in itself, and yet...

373
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:43,100
boku ni totte nara sore dake de mou juubun na hazu na no ni

374
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:51,000
All little old me ever does is repeat the same old mistakes

375
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:51,000
chippoke na boku wa kurikaesu ayamachi bakari

376
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,460
How much strength do I need to come by

377
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,460
dore hodo tsuyosa wo te ni shitara

378
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,430
before I can get by without hurting anything?

379
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,430
nanimo kizutsukezu ni sumu no?

380
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,960
I am not going to stray, I'm going to trust this love,

381
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,960
mayowazu ni kono ai wo,

382
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,770
and with it I will go on living!

383
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,770
shinjikite yuku

384
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,330
I'm going to take these wounds,

385
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,330
fusagaranu

386
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,020
the ones that will not close, and squeeze them tight!

387
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,020
kizuguchi mo gyutto dakishimete

388
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,280
The two of us must keep on walking,

389
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,280
futari wa arukitsuzukeru

390
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,160
The two of us must keep on walking,

391
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,160
futari wa arukitsuzukeru

392
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,250
since we can never return again

393
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,250
ato ni wa modorenai kara

394
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:29,300
Even now, deep within my heart,

395
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:29,300
ima demo kono mune no oku,

396
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:35,250
I still feel the pain of this indelible sin

397
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:35,250
kesenai tsumi wa itamu kedo

398
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:35,510
Darling

399
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,600
Darling

400
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,460
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

401
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,000
Land of Stones, Part 2

402
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,950
Land of Stones, Part 2

403
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,020
Land of Stones, Part 2

404
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,230
Episode 12: "Land of Stones, Part 2"

405
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,730
Now that you've taken on the name of Edward Elric,

406
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,110
are you prepared for 
the consequences?!
