1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,860
Here, take this with you.

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,570
There <i>are</i> ways of handing this to me 
that are a bit more poignant, you know.

3
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,160
Congrats. You too are now 
officially a dog of the military.

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,740
Lieutenant Havoc, take him home.

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,490
Yes, sir.

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,010
Nina...

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,700
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

8
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,250
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

9
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,290
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

10
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,430
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:02,040
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

12
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:02,040
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:02,040
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:02,040
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,510
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,510
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,510
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,510
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

19
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,710
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

20
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,710
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

21
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,710
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

22
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,710
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

23
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,510
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

24
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,510
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

25
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,510
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

26
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:16,550
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

27
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:16,550
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

28
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,510
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

29
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,510
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

30
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,260
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

31
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,260
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

32
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,260
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

34
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,980
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

35
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,980
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

36
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,380
Looking at the sky, 
thinking tomorrow must be coming,

37
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,380
asu ga kuru hazu no sora wo mite

38
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:36,880
it's too much for my captivated heart to take

39
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:36,880
mayou bakari no kokoro mote amashite iru

40
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,630
As a bird flutters along beside me,

41
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,630
katawara no tori ga habataita

42
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:47,730
I wonder where he managed to find his light

43
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:47,730
doko ka hikari wo mitsukerareta no ka na

44
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,630
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

45
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,630
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

46
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,170
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

47
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,170
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

48
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,170
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

49
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,170
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

50
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,340
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

51
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,340
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

52
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:05,730
And leave me at the highest place there is,

53
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:05,730
And leave me at the highest place there is,

54
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:05,730
soshite ichiban takai tokoro de

55
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:05,730
soshite ichiban takai tokoro de

56
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,620
far away from kindness?

57
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,620
okizari ni shite, yasashisa kara toozakete

58
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:20,990
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

59
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:20,990
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

60
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:29,830

61
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:29,830
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

62
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,000

Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,550
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,550

Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

69
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,530
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

70
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,550
Hey, Chief, don't make that face.

71
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,820
The Lt. Colonel is wrapped up in something of a tough case right now.

72
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,650
A case?

73
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,150
A serial killer who only 
goes after women.

74
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,990
That's a job for the police, isn't it?

75
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,880
If the military lets it go for 
too long in their own backyard,

76
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,740
it becomes a matter of honor, see?

77
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,400
He's after another promotion, huh?

78
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,860
It is true that the Lt. Colonel is a man who won't hesitate

79
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,630
to use any means necessary to get promoted.

80
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,750
But if that's all he ever did, we wouldn't follow him.

81
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,720
What do you mean by that?

82
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,970
You'll find out soon enough.

83
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,940
Night of the Chimera's Cry

84
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,940
Night of the Chimera's Cry

85
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,020
Ta-daa!

86
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,630
Brother, is that...?

87
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,600
Hey, you! Hold it! Hold it, I tell you!

88
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,950
Give that back! Give it back!

89
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,330
Fooling around again...

90
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,060
Give it back! Please, give it back!

91
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,650
He's the talk of the town.

92
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,970
Whoever would've thought that a twelve-year-old could pass the certification exam?

93
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,340
Prodigies. They do exist.

94
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,180
Well, to celebrate Edward-kun passing his test, 
we're going to have a big feast today!

95
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,760
Terrific!

96
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,940
You mean it?!

97
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,900
Uh-huh.

98
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,170
Would you like to join us?

99
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,250
I still have work to do.

100
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,550
Is that so?

101
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,230
Ah, Tucker-san...

102
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,410
I have a message from 
the Lt. Colonel for you.

103
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,240
"Assessment day will be here soon."

104
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,830
"I'm looking forward to it."

105
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,120
Yes, I know.

106
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,130
This assessment thing—

107
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,710
is it for State Alchemists?

108
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:38,840
Mm-hmm.

109
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,960
If I don't report the findings of my research and get evaluated once every year,

110
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,300
my certification as a State Alchemist will be taken from me.

111
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,640
That's rough.

112
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,960
Last year, I didn't receive a good evaluation,

113
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,480
so I have to do better this year.

114
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,980
Let 'em have it, Papa!

115
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,060
Will you go with a Chimera that can understand human speech?

116
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,280
Once you complete it, please show us, okay?

117
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,270
Sure, I promise.

118
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,900
Once it's complete, I'll be sure to let you two have a look at it.

119
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,550
A letter? Who are you writing to?

120
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,630
I-It doesn't matter who it's to!

121
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,140
Ah, Brother, it's to Winry, right?

122
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,940
I-It's just a simple report!

123
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,320
"I just succeeded in becoming a State Alchemist! Take that!"

124
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,880
That sort of thing!

125
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,730
Is Winry Big Brother's girlfriend?

126
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,270
As a matter of fact—

127
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,980
No! She's not! She's not! 
She's not! She's not! She's not!

128
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,780
I'm going to write 
my mom a letter too!

129
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,290
Say, your mom is far away, right?

130
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,540
Mm-hmm. She said Dad was a good-for-nothing,

131
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,500
and she couldn't put up with him anymore, so she went back to her parents' home.

132
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,700
I hope Mom sends me a reply.

133
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,320
Here.

134
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:37,350
My wife couldn't stand being poor and left us.

135
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,170
That was just before 
I became a State Alchemist.

136
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,100
If my certification is taken from me,

137
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,410
we'll fall back to the way 
things were then.

138
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,930
If I'm going to keep this lifestyle,

139
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,300
I have to pass this assessment, no matter what.

140
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:58,180
Papa, good luck studying!

141
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,320
I get it,

142
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,200
you want to go for a walk, right?

143
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,420
Not this simple stuff!

144
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,470
I want to find out about a Chimera that 
a man named Tucker created two years ago!

145
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,260
Hey, Scieszka, do you know about this?

146
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,230
Shou Tucker-san's reports are restricted reading.

147
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,200
Would you check on it, please?

148
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,850
I'm not any ordinary person, here!

149
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,200
That's not what I meant.

150
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,440
Unless you have permission from Brigadier General Basque Grand—

151
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,320
Brigadier General Basque Grand?

152
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,700
Don't you know the 
Iron Blood Alchemist?

153
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,520
He's the foremost authority on 
redirecting alchemy to military tactics.

154
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,750
If you need his permission, 
that must mean it's a military secret.

155
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,500
Military secret?

156
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,380
You can't go in! Please stop!

157
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,090
This first branch is only for State Alchemist use,

158
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,150
and no one without permission from the military can enter.

159
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,350
But I was told that this is the only place where I would find out!

160
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,800
N-Now hold on!

161
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,270
What?!

162
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,270
Sorry, but those seem to be the rules.

163
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,200
Hey, hold it!

164
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,760
Brother,

165
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,630
I don't understand. 
Why would you place this...

166
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,770
this despicable alchemy brand upon me?

167
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,520
Look, Elicia-chan,

168
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,000
it's your big brother Ed!

169
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,020
Honey, pay attention to what Ed-chan is saying.

170
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,700
Go ahead, take your time.

171
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,500
Let's see... Tucker's Chimera, right?

172
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,350
Uh-huh. Major, you're in the 
Investigations Department, right?

173
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,070
I thought you might know something.

174
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,500
You could just ask him yourself, 
couldn't you?

175
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,030
Yeah, but he's so busy now, 
just before his assessment, and all.

176
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,780
I don't know all that much myself.

177
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,470
They say that Tucker is the first person in history to create a Chimera

178
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,850
that could speak and 
understand human language.

179
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,770
You're sure about that?

180
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:49,000
I hear that the Chimera definitely said one thing: "I want to die."

181
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,820
Apparently, after that, 
it didn't eat anything and died.

182
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,820
I wonder why Tucker-san 
would create such a thing.

183
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,370
Who knows?

184
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,650
But there was someone in the military who at least 
thought there was some value in utilizing it.

185
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,540
What about Tucker-san's wife?

186
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,710
Ah, you mean the one who died before they came to Central?

187
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,170
Am I mistaken?

188
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,590
Yes, this is Hughes.

189
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,760
That serial killer?!

190
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,020
Mama! Mama!

191
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,280
This makes the fifth one, huh?

192
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,150
Hasn't Investigations found anything yet?

193
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,280
Don't take it out on us.

194
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,080
Mama!

195
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,110
Hey, what's the matter?! Hey!

196
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,950
Sounds like you saw 
something awful, huh?

197
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,480
I'm fine now.

198
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,750
You've been calling for your mother the whole time.

199
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,860
And apologizing, too.

200
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,070
I've had my suspicions 
ever since I saw your bodies.

201
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,820
Your mother, huh?

202
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,100
That must've been tough.

203
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,730
What you did was forbidden from the outset.

204
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,440
However, I understand how you must've felt.

205
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,480
Who are you people?!

206
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,970
I don't know what Mustang told you,

207
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,330
but matters concerning Shou Tucker fall under the jurisdiction of me, Basque Grand!

208
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,170
Basque Grand?

209
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,410
That's you?

210
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:16,300
The Sewing Life Alchemist's research is one of the military's most secret matters.

211
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,300
It is not an area upon which 
others may tread frivolously.

212
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,010
Big Brothers, where are you going?

213
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,980
We'll be back in a little while 
to play with you.

214
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,040
Really?

215
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,050
Mm-hmm!

216
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,850
Yeah.

217
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,070
Make sure you do!

218
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,610
It's not aggravating to you?

219
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,820
I hear that when that kid showed off his transmutation abilities without using a circle,

220
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,600
the Führer bestowed 
words of praise upon him.

221
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,710
Thanks to him, that upstart Mustang was able to score some more points.

222
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,100
I'm sorry to have worried you.

223
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,740
I managed to smooth things over last year,

224
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,860
but if you don't show 
any results this year too,

225
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,340
then I will be put in an awkward position for having supported you.

226
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,390
But...

227
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:11,250
Or would you rather yield the title of Sewing Life Alchemist to that kid

228
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,150
and go back to 
your former lifestyle?

229
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,900
A life of wandering from town to town 
on an empty stomach?

230
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,540
This is the end of the line.

231
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,810
Your assessment will be held the day after tomorrow.

232
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,730
Papa?

233
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,880
Do you hurt somewhere?

234
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,430
I'm at the end of the line here, Nina.

235
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,020
Papa...

236
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,620
What if by doing this, the certification 
you worked so hard to get is taken away?

237
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,710
If there's nothing here, 
it'll be fine with me.

238
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,930
Over here.

239
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,770
Come on in.

240
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,320
Have a look.

241
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,540
It's a finished version of a Chimera that can understand human words.

242
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,650
Listen, that person is Edward.

243
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,160
Ed... ward...

244
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,510
That's right! Nicely done.

245
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,800
Nicely... done...

246
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,020
Unbelievable! It really is talking!

247
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,810
Somehow, I managed to make it 
in time for the assessment.

248
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,070
Now I can get by without having to worry about research funding.

249
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,880
Ed... ward...

250
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,130
It's okay...

251
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,890
Big... Brother... Ed...

252
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,820
Brother?

253
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,390
Tucker-san...

254
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:02,980
Something the matter?

255
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,700
When was the first time you transmuted 
a Chimera that could understand human language?

256
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,140
I told you, didn't I?

257
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,000
Two years ago.

258
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,660
And when did your wife leave?

259
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,580
Two years ago.

260
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,960
Do your letters still reach your wife?

261
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,920
What are you trying to say?

262
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,590
Where have Nina and Alexander gone?!

263
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,550
I hate perceptive kids like you.

264
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:37,970
Brother!

265
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,220
Yeah, that's right!

266
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,400
Your own wife?!

267
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,060
And now, this time,

268
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,520
he used his own daughter and dog 
to transmute a Chimera!

269
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,920
It's easy when you 
use people, huh? Yeah?!

270
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,200
What are you so upset about?

271
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,540
As is typical of medical science,

272
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,400
the advancement of mankind comes as the result of countless animal experiments, doesn't it?

273
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,950
Since you, too, are a scientist—

274
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,950
Stop messing around!

275
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,300
Do you think you can get away with something like this?!

276
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,840
With toying around with people's lives like this?!

277
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,970
People's lives?

278
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,910
Right, people's lives, indeed!

279
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,850
Your arm and leg 
and your brother's body—

280
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:21,310
aren't they also results of 
toying around with people's lives?

281
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,080
Why, Tucker-san?

282
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,140
Didn't you need to 
pass your assessment

283
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,200
so that you could continue your life with Nina?

284
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,950
I had no reason to 
create the Chimera.

285
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,880
The possibility was there 
before my eyes, so I tried it.

286
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,650
A Chimera that could 
understand human words—

287
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,420
I just wanted to see 
if I could make one.

288
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,950
You've got to be kidding me.

289
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,900
I knew that it was anathema,

290
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,500
but I couldn't help myself from 
trying out a human transmutation.

291
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,520
You're the same as me.

292
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,430
I am not!

293
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,780
As a scientist—no, as a person,

294
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:09,750
there are no bounds to your desire to 
put your own knowledge into practice.

295
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,240
You want to test out what kind of power has been given to you,

296
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:19,070
by learning all of the secrets that are hidden in this world.

297
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:22,350
That is the essence of alchemy.

298
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:30,710
We're not... Alchemy isn't... this sort of thing...

299
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,360
I'm not like that!

300
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,630
I'm not! I'm not! I'm not! I'm not! I'm not!

301
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,630
Brother! He'll die!

302
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,110
Big... Brother...

303
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,840
Nina, this might hurt a little,

304
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,900
but bear with me.

305
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,200
Brother! Are you planning to re-transmute her?!

306
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,700
That's not something we can do!

307
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,120
My Chimera has been perfectly transmuted!

308
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,910
Nobody can return it 
to the way it was!

309
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,170
Be careful! Make sure you don't do to her 
what you did to your mother!

310
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,140
Let's play...

311
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,150
Let's play...

312
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:26,950
Nina...

313
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,140
What's going on here, Edward Elric?!

314
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,400
He used his own daughter...

315
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,240
The Chimera and Tucker will be dealt with in conjunction with a court martial.

316
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,740
You will not speak of what you saw here to anyone else.

317
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,040
Hold on! You guys knew what
Tucker had done, didn't you?!

318
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,120
You're just getting rid of the eviden—

319
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,180
Let's go!

320
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,340
Yes, sir!

321
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:09,640
Dammit! I'm not about to let you whisk them away!

322
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,190
Nina!

323
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,780
Brother!

324
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,250
You are composed of both man and beast, are you?

325
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,520
Why would I know such a thing?

326
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,030
How regrettable...

327
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:09,620
O God, that great God who hast created us and all other things...

328
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:15,050
Please receive this woeful spirit into thy bosom.

329
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,520
Brother!

330
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,680
Nina!

331
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,600
<i>God, I now understand.</i>

332
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,240
<i>The reason why my brother 
gave me this accursed arm—</i>

333
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,200
<i>it was so that I would take those alchemists, who have departed from the path of God,</i>

334
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,880
<i>and with their same devilish works,</i>

335
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,750
<i>and destroy them.</i>

336
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,350
It's...

337
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,960
as though she was decomposed by an alchemist...

338
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,970
But who...

339
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,500
But then, even if we were to do something...

340
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,260
I'm sorry...

341
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,220
Nina, I'm sorry...

342
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,470
Brother...

343
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,700
With you always in my sight, I can manage to draw breath

344
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,700
itsumo no shisen ni kimi ga ite kokyuu ga dekiru

345
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:43,100
And for me, that ought to be enough in itself, and yet...

346
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:43,100
boku ni totte nara sore dake de mou juubun na hazu na no ni

347
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:51,090
All little old me ever does is repeat the same old mistakes

348
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:51,090
chippoke na boku wa kurikaesu ayamachi bakari

349
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:54,460
How much strength do I need to come by

350
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:54,460
dore hodo tsuyosa wo te ni shitara

351
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,480
before I can get by without hurting anything?

352
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,480
nanimo kizutsukezu ni sumu no?

353
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:02,010
I am not going to stray, I'm going to trust this love,

354
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:02,010
mayowazu ni kono ai wo,

355
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,820
and with it I will go on living!

356
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,820
shinjikite yuku

357
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,380
I'm going to take these wounds,

358
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,380
fusagaranu

359
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:11,070
the ones that will not close, and squeeze them tight!

360
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:11,070
kizuguchi mo gyutto dakishimete

361
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:11,330
The two of us must keep on walking,

362
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:11,330
futari wa arukitsuzukeru

363
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:17,260
The two of us must keep on walking,

364
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:17,260
futari wa arukitsuzukeru

365
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:23,350
since we can never return again

366
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:23,350
ato ni wa modorenai kara

367
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:29,400
Even now, deep within my heart,

368
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:29,400
ima demo kono mune no oku,

369
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,250
I still feel the pain of this indelible sin

370
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,250
kesenai tsumi wa itamu kedo

371
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:35,510
Darling

372
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,600
Darling

373
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,570
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

374
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,960
The Philosopher's Stone

375
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,910
The Philosopher's Stone

376
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,980
The Philosopher's Stone

377
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,980
Episode 8: "The Philosopher's Stone"

378
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,320
We can't do anything.

379
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,110
We're only children.

380
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,280
Even so, we can still...
