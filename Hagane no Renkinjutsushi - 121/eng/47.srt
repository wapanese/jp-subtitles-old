1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,060
Come along now, Alphonse.

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,120
That must have hurt,

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,540
but it's okay now.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,070
I'll make it better right away.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,570
Remember? Like I did 
when you were a little boy.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,580
Mom?

7
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,590
Yes.

8
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,400
Mama...

9
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,430
Mama...

10
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,840
The Philosopher's Stone.

11
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:48,030
Those who obtain it are set free from the Law of Equivalent Exchange.

12
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,820
There is no need to pay a price 
in order to obtain something, either.

13
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,650
We sought it and found it.

14
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,060
The reason I want to spit these creaky old memories out

15
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,060
kishinda omoi o hakidashitai no wa

16
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,840
The reason I want to spit these creaky old memories out

17
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,840
kishinda omoi o hakidashitai no wa

18
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,230
is because I don't have any other proof of my existence

19
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,230
sonzai no shoumei ga hoka ni nai kara

20
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:25,580
The future that I thought I had grabbed hold of

21
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:25,580
tsukanda hazu no boku no mirai wa

22
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:31,080
is a contradiction of dignity and freedom

23
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:31,080
'songen' to 'jiyuu' de mujun shiteru yo

24
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,680
The reason I want to wipe away this distorted afterimage

25
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,680
yuganda zanzou o keshisaritai no wa

26
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,770
is because I see my own limitations within it

27
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,770
jibun no genkai o soko ni miru kara

28
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,070
is because I see my own limitations within it

29
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,070
jibun no genkai o soko ni miru kara

30
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:52,430
In the window of my overly self-conscious self

31
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:52,430
jiishikikajou na boku no mado ni wa

32
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:52,690
is last year's calendar, without any dates written in

33
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:52,690
kyonen no calendar, hizuke ga nai yo

34
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,740
is last year's calendar, without any dates written in

35
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,740
kyonen no calendar, hizuke ga nai yo

36
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,660
I'll erase it and rewrite it

37
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,660
keshite rewrite shite

38
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,280
with nonsensical surrealism

39
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,280
kudaranai chougensou

40
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,130
and an unforgettable sense of presence

41
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,130
wasurarenu sonzaikan o

42
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:13,340
Return from the brink of death, and rewrite it

43
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:13,340
kishikaisei rewrite shite

44
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,040
Even meaningless figments of imagination

45
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,040
imi no nai souzou mo

46
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,240
can be the driving force that gives you form

47
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,240
kimi o nasu gendouryoku

48
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,500
Give your whole body and soul to me

49
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,500
zenshinzenrei o kure yo

50
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,990
Sealing the Homunculus

51
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,990
Sealing the Homunculus

52
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,240
Let...

53
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,240
Let me try again, please!

54
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,750
Al-kun, please,

55
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,210
I beg you.

56
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,960
Your role in this is over, Tucker.

57
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,470
Brother...

58
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,950
You homunculus, get away from Al!

59
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,950
Brother, this is...

60
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,910
Yeah, I was taken in as well.

61
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,810
But that isn't Mom.

62
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,760
I'm aware of that too, but...

63
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,460
No matter whose form 
she may resemble,

64
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,750
that thing doesn't have a soul!

65
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,090
What an awful thing to say, Edward.

66
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Please, Al-kun...

67
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,460
Tucker! You intentionally 
called Al here by himself?!

68
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,530
It's equivalent exchange. By using the Philosopher's Stone, this is what happened.

69
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,130
You were suckered 
into this by Tucker!

70
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,280
Dammit, there's getting to be too many people I'm planning to whale on later,

71
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,270
and if I don't make notes or something of them all, I'm going to forget!

72
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,090
Never mind. Right now, you're coming with me.

73
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,730
He can't do that, Ed.

74
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,290
Are you going to 
return Al back to normal?

75
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,690
Or are you just going to let the whole rest of Al's body

76
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,960
be used up by this 
"you-know-who" person?!

77
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,050
Al, get out of the way!

78
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,210
Brother!

79
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,530
You stay out of the way!

80
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,530
That hurt, Edward.

81
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,240
I know it's going to take 
more than that for you to die.

82
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,660
Don't run away.

83
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,500
What's this?

84
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,460
It's the transmutation circle

85
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,760
that was drawn inside Dante-san's house when I defeated Greed.

86
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,770
This is what seals up 
you homunculi, right?

87
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,560
You're smart, aren't you? 
But this alone is not enough.

88
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,270
I know. It also takes a 
homunculus' only weakness—

89
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,290
a portion of the 
body of the person

90
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,990
who was the object of the attempt at resurrection by human transmutation.

91
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,220
Brother, what is that?!

92
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:44,300
The object of the human transmutation that gave rise to this homunculus.

93
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,050
Mom...

94
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,500
Brother, you dug up Mom's grave 
without telling me!

95
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,850
I'm the only one who 
needed to go through that!

96
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,930
It's no use, Sloth.

97
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,860
Doing that won't erase 
the transmutation circle.

98
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,360
I carved it deep with 
these nails, after all.

99
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,700
Thanks.

100
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,830
It's not like I did it 
because I wanted that thing.

101
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,340
Why... would you betray the One?

102
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,850
Sloth,

103
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,840
do you really not 
remember anything?

104
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,090
What are you talking about?

105
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,390
I remember.

106
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,020
It's just a little bit, but still...

107
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,690
There's no reason why 
we should have any memories.

108
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,570
Maybe it's just that the thoughts of the person 
who performs human transmutation are so strong,

109
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,550
and the memories of 
the deceased get burned in.

110
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,640
Still, even so, 
I do have memories.

111
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,780
I was...

112
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,260
an Ishbalan woman.

113
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,620
Stop it.

114
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,090
If the memories of before you were born 
were ever to return to you...

115
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,220
Stop it, Lust!

116
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,640
...then it will be you 
that gets a glimpse of hell.

117
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,710
Al! What are you doing?!

118
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,700
Brother, you can't use 
Mom's body to do this!

119
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:32,030
Al, if we don't kill them, 
they're going to be after you forever!

120
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:38,030
But if you were able to stop her with that, then that's what that means, right?

121
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,660
She's what was born back then.

122
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,340
Al, she's a homunculus!

123
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,920
A homunculus is born during 
a failed human transmutation.

124
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,670
Even if she doesn't have a soul...

125
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,200
Please, Al!

126
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,030
We're the ones who made her!

127
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,860
That's right! That's why we have to bury her!

128
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,680
We can't!

129
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,360
Al!

130
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,680
In that case, <i>I'll</i> do it.

131
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,910
Go pick it up, Fullmetal boy. We can still seal her.

132
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,130
You were trying to 
pick on Mama using this, huh?

133
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,550
Mama?

134
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,630
Wrath, she is not your mother!

135
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,630
I've decided to take everything of yours away from you.

136
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,990
She's not my mother either.

137
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,140
Then I'll take her.

138
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,940
Hand it over.

139
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,240
What are you doing to Mama?!

140
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,960
Mama?

141
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,410
He's looking for a mother, 
and he's found a substitute.

142
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,570
Stop, I tell you!

143
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,060
Come on, let's go.

144
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:51,540
Al!

145
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,010
I will handle Wrath.

146
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,160
You're a little old to be longing for mother's milk, aren't you?

147
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,790
That won't do any good. I can keep coming back to life forever.

148
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,930
As many times as you have red stones, right?

149
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,670
Which is why...

150
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,980
I will kill you as many times...

151
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,560
as it takes...

152
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,330
to use them up.

153
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,440
I'm...

154
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,690
going to become him!

155
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,200
What would doing that make you?

156
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,950
Well, for that matter...

157
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,410
what am I doing here at all?!

158
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,670
The whole thing was 
a mistake from the start.

159
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:18,390
Have you forgotten? 
I can use alchemy!

160
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,610
Al!

161
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,030
I'm sorry!

162
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,030
I can't get free!

163
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:00,050
If I touch him, there'll be a reaction, 
and there's no telling what will happen!

164
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,840
Yes, so it seems. So back off.

165
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,810
Mom!

166
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,010
You get it now, Al? She's not Mom!

167
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,760
Mom wouldn't say something like that!

168
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,560
She wouldn't use you as a shield, Al!

169
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,560
And she wouldn't hit me!

170
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,780
Brother!

171
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,610
You can't touch your brother, so you're trying to use a transmutation circle.

172
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,910
But I won't give you 
enough time to draw one!

173
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,160
Brother!

174
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,870
That was enough!

175
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:34,880
Al!

176
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,020
Isn't this what you wanted?

177
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,690
You wanted to become human so you could die, didn't you?

178
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,700
I wanted to die...

179
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,210
Is that it?

180
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,910
I...

181
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,670
wanted to die?

182
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,740
If I become human...

183
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,850
does it just mean death?

184
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,900
Then, what is it to be 
completely human?

185
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,240
Can't you answer me?! 
You're a human!

186
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,460
Mama...

187
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,160
That's right...

188
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,240
I have to protect Mama.

189
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,410
Al, sorry about that.

190
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,350
Mm-mm, <i>I'm</i> the one who's sorry.

191
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,720
Come to think of it, 
where's Lust?

192
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,730
That night...

193
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,590
That night, I...

194
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,110
I saw you...

195
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,220
Edward.

196
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,960
Eat these.

197
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,600
They are his sons, after all.

198
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:58,450
I knew this would happen.

199
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,640
She's starting to look a little more presentable, huh?

200
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,610
You all used to 
look like that as well.

201
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,470
What...

202
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,460
was that?

203
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,680
There were children...

204
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,720
two of them...

205
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,830
and a husband.

206
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,150
I was happy...

207
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,970
and yet very...

208
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,280
sad.

209
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,980
You will understand 
once you become human.

210
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,620
Human?

211
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,660
I will assist you.

212
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,690
Find the Philosopher's Stone.

213
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,160
How about I place her at your side?

214
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,890
There is a vacant military registry 
that I used during the Ishbal incident.

215
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,200
She can slip in using that.

216
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,510
Yes. If you were to 
take her home with you,

217
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,240
your adorable wife would become jealous, huh?

218
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,460
Sloth...

219
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,460
As of today,

220
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,070
you are Sloth.

221
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,720
Is she vibrating her cells and generating heat?

222
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,690
Edward...

223
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:34,120
Stop pretending to be Mom! 
You don't even have any of her memories!

224
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,620
I <i>do</i> have memories.

225
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,070
Like Lust said,

226
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:45,030
maybe the thoughts of your mother 
within you were just burned into me.

227
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,650
You're lying! If that were so, 
you wouldn't be able to do this!

228
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,420
It's <i>why</i>...

229
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,320
I'm able to do this.

230
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,930
I do have memories.

231
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,440
Memories of myself as your mother...

232
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,140
And yet,

233
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,690
your mother is dead.

234
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,690
I am...

235
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,760
not human.

236
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,270
Who am I?

237
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,780
I am...

238
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,280
going to kill you.

239
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:21,090
By doing so, I can prove 
that I am not your mother.

240
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,270
If you were no longer here,

241
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,810
I wouldn't be tormented by these memories.

242
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,250
I am not your mother, and yet...

243
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,790
I feel I <i>am</i> your mother.

244
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,800
I almost feel as though 
I could love you.

245
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,800
You created me.

246
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,670
I'm supposed to hate you.

247
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,450
Brother, what should we do?!

248
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,370
This is the form 
our sin has taken on!

249
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,660
Mama!

250
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,350
I am not your mother.

251
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,350
I have no intention 
of holding you.

252
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,290
Brother...

253
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:48,870
Mama!

254
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,760
I transmuted my Automail into sodium.

255
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,420
It explodes when it 
reacts with water.

256
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,910
Mama! Mama!

257
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,910
Stop it!

258
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,590
She wasn't anyone's mama.

259
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,340
Your mama is dead.

260
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,340
Mama! Mama!

261
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,560
Mama!

262
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,360
No matter what you do,

263
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,260
I am not going to die.

264
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,070
Mama!

265
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,600
Mama!

266
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,600
Stay back, Wrath.

267
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,300
Mama, I'm going to 
become one with you!

268
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,840
He fused himself with another homunculus?

269
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,510
Wrath...

270
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,830
What have you done?

271
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:50,600
He took the portion of my mom 
I brought with me inside his own body.

272
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,050
With it that close to you, 
you can't move, can you?

273
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:05,800
Prosti menya, mladshiy brat!

274
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:05,800
Please forgive me, my junior brother,

275
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,410
I'm going to reconstruct 
all of the material

276
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,950
you're composed of 
into another material.

277
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,120
Ya tak pred toboy vinovat

278
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,120
I’m so guilty towards you

279
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,200
That's not possible, Brother!

280
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,330
You can't transmute a person's body!

281
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,710
I realized something 
during my fight with Greed.

282
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,770
Pyitatsya vernut' nyelzya

283
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,770
One shouldn’t try to regain

284
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,130
I rearranged the elements he was composed of.

285
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:20,500
togo, chto vzyala zyemlya

286
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:20,500
what was taken by the earth

287
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,440
It's not like what Kimbly did,

288
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,050
when he restructured the 
elements in just one place.

289
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,390
Milaya mama! Nyezhnaya!

290
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,390
Dear mother! Affectionate one!

291
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,630
I'll be able to restructure 
the entire body.

292
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,760
The reason being 
that a homunculus...

293
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:31,350
Myi tak lyubili tebya

294
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:31,350
We loved you so much

295
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,310
is not human!

296
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:36,130
No vse nashi silyi

297
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:36,130
But all our efforts

298
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:41,060
potrachenyi byili zrya

299
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:41,060
were spent in vain

300
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,970
Mama...

301
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,190
What did you do?!

302
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,640
What did you do to Mama?!

303
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:46,300
Tebya soblaznil ya

304
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:46,300
I lured you

305
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,120
Get away from her.

306
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,450
Get away from her now.

307
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:51,300

308
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:51,300
with the beautiful hope

309
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:47,860
Mama?

310
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,950
I restructured your water into ethanol.

00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:56,480

312
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:56,480
to regain our familial hearth

313
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,630
It vaporizes at room temperature.

314
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,220
As my tears well up,

315
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,220

320
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,500
At the end of all the grief,

00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,380

Stay... stay... stay... stay...

It's true, I cannot see you now,

356
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,610
This is the path I have chosen.
