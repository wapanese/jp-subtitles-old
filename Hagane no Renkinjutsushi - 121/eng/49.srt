1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,900
Welcome home, Father!

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,690
I'm home, Selim.

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,160
Here.

4
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,910
You can go ahead and open it.

5
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:25,540
Okay!

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,050
Thank you very much!

7
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,050
Happy tenth birthday, Selim.

8
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,890
Where are we?

9
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,920
We're at you-know-who's place.

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,170
"You-know-who"?

11
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,210
The one who is making you homunculi search for the Philosopher's Stone?

12
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,860
That's not all.

13
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,440
The one who found us, 
brought us together, and nurtured us.

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,990
You're being tricked—all you homunculi who want to become human.

15
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,490
Those who are being tricked are fools.

16
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,600
What about you?

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,460
Yeah, I know.

18
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,750
That person just wants the 
Philosopher's Stone to use personally.

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,150
So what?

20
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:15,760
As long as I get to see humans suffer, 
that's good enough for me.

21
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,470
Hey, now, your body is precious.

22
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,020
Don't do anything reckless.

23
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,640
Shoot!

24
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:33,130
How many people do you think Scar killed to make you the Philosopher's Stone?

25
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,070
Of the soldiers who 
charged into Liore,

26
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,410
seven thousand of them 
disappeared in an instant.

27
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,910
They're not dead.

28
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,910
They're all right here.

29
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,750
Oh yeah, and the guys that died long ago in Ishbal who were in Scar's right arm

30
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,670
are locked away 
inside there as well.

31
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,000
Awesome, awesome!

32
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,290
You've got thousands—tens of thousands—of lives there inside you.

33
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,680
We should put them 
to good use, huh?!

34
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,940
I should have died.

35
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,020
Back then...

36
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,190
and back then...

37
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,700
and back then too.

38
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,470
So then, why am I still alive?

39
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,570
Brother?

40
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,210
Dad?

41
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,400
The Philosopher's Stone.

42
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:35,560
Those who obtain it are set free from the Law of Equivalent Exchange.

43
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,440
There is no need to pay a price 
in order to obtain something, either.

44
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,200
We sought it and found it.

45
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,070
The reason I want to spit these creaky old memories out

46
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,070
kishinda omoi o hakidashitai no wa

47
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:02,850
The reason I want to spit these creaky old memories out

48
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:02,850
kishinda omoi o hakidashitai no wa

49
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:08,240
is because I don't have any other proof of my existence

50
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:08,240
sonzai no shoumei ga hoka ni nai kara

51
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,590
The future that I thought I had grabbed hold of

52
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,590
tsukanda hazu no boku no mirai wa

53
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:19,090
is a contradiction of dignity and freedom

54
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:19,090
'songen' to 'jiyuu' de mujun shiteru yo

55
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,690
The reason I want to wipe away this distorted afterimage

56
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,690
yuganda zanzou o keshisaritai no wa

57
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,780
is because I see my own limitations within it

58
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,780
jibun no genkai o soko ni miru kara

59
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,080
is because I see my own limitations within it

60
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,080
jibun no genkai o soko ni miru kara

61
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,440
In the window of my overly self-conscious self

62
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,440
jiishikikajou na boku no mado ni wa

63
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:40,700
is last year's calendar, without any dates written in

64
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:40,700
kyonen no calendar, hizuke ga nai yo

65
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,750
is last year's calendar, without any dates written in

66
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,750
kyonen no calendar, hizuke ga nai yo

67
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,670
I'll erase it and rewrite it

68
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,670
keshite rewrite shite

69
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,290
with nonsensical surrealism

70
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,290
kudaranai chougensou

71
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,140
and an unforgettable sense of presence

72
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,140
wasurarenu sonzaikan o

73
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:01,350
Return from the brink of death, and rewrite it

74
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:01,350
kishikaisei rewrite shite

75
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,050
Even meaningless figments of imagination

76
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,050
imi no nai souzou mo

77
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,250
can be the driving force that gives you form

78
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,250
kimi o nasu gendouryoku

79
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:11,510
Give your whole body and soul to me

80
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:11,510
zenshinzenrei o kure yo

81
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,370
The Other Side of the Gate

82
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,370
The Other Side of the Gate

83
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,750
Edward-san!

84
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,350
What were you doing?

85
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,530
Sorry. Is this the place?

86
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,100
Yes. This is definitely the place.

87
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,090
Show me one more time.

88
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:54,600
Dad once came here to Central, 
looking for a way to refine the red water.

89
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,110
He wound up going to a place called the 5th Laboratory,

90
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,560
and there, he met up 
with a certain alchemist.

91
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,400
That person told him that there was some indispensable element

92
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,870
that was necessary to transmute the red water 
all the way into a Philosopher's Stone

93
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,520
and hinted to him 
that it was human lives.

94
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,380
He also showed him 
where the real laboratory was.

95
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,000
The 5th Laboratory was nothing more than a secret entrance.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,720
In fact, there was an even larger human experimentation lab.

97
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,460
This does indeed appear to be the place that we have been searching for.

98
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,760
I'm going alone.

99
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,440
But Al-kun is in danger, 
though we don't know what kind, right?

100
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,280
It's all right. He's just 
gotten a little lost. That's all.

101
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,780
Ed...

102
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,180
The reason why we showed you what was in this journal...

103
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,870
was not because we wanted you to make a Philosopher's Stone.

104
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,010
I know. I'm not going there 
to create a Philosopher's Stone.

105
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,100
Believe me.

106
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,650
Come back to us now!

107
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,350
Come back to us alive!

108
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,110
According to Dad's journal,

109
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,520
you descend from the temple of the ancient religion

110
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,490
and go farther and farther underground, 
and then suddenly...

111
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,920
there's another city, 
all tucked away beneath Central.

112
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,990
Dad said that judging by its style of architecture,

113
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,930
it looked like the city was nearly four hundred years old.

114
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,240
There's a legend that says 
that the city that was there,

115
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,720
where Central is now, 
vanished overnight.

116
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:04,370
Dad says he thought that there might have been alchemists who were performing

117
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:09,860
some kind of experiment and may have closed up the whole city underground.

118
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,910
The people of the city 
were all sacrificed

119
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,200
to be used in their 
Philosopher's Stone.

120
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,860
And then, to hide the fact that there weren't any people left,

121
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,710
they made the city itself disappear.

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,310
There's actually someone who thought that up?

123
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,930
Is anyone there?!

124
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,560
I know you're here! You knew about everything, didn't you,

125
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,060
Pop?!

126
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,270
No, Gluttony.

127
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,120
Be patient.

128
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,260
This girl's body is 
very important, after all.

129
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:05,250
So pretty. It's no wonder why Ed and Al would like you.

130
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,260
They <i>are</i> his children.

131
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,470
Hey, what happened to Lust?!

132
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,590
Yes, what could have 
happened to her?

133
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,250
That's right, I need to 
get my dress ready.

134
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,630
We have to be pretty 
when we greet him.

135
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,480
Somebody's here.

136
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,480
My, that was quick.

137
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,730
Where is he?

138
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,920
Wrath...

139
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,920
Where is he?!

140
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,320
What a pest!

141
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,430
Where's the Philosopher's Stone?!

142
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,300
What's the meaning of this?

143
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,160
Where is he?! Where did he go?!

144
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,950
I thought he was keeping an eye on Edward.

145
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,330
Tell me, Envy! Please!

146
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,330
That's what I thought I told him to do.

147
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,410
Please! Give me the 
Philosopher's Stone, quick!

148
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:44,350
Wrath, you have to be a good boy, 
or I won't make you human.

149
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,920
There's no time for that!

150
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Mama... Mama is going to be all gone!

151
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,080
Mama?

152
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,300
He means Sloth.

153
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,120
Sloth is not your mama.

154
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,410
Homunculi do not have mothers.

155
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,430
Bring Mama back to life! Please!

156
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,930
Don't talk like you're human.

157
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,810
Mama... Mama!

158
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,550
Mama!

159
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,310
Envy!

160
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,190
Please!

161
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:20,030
What do you think 
you can do in your shape?

162
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,140
What power!

163
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,220
It's only natural that 
Edward Elric would use Automail.

164
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,590
This is fun!

165
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,440
Someone like you is a soldier?

166
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,810
That explains why no one has realized who the Führer is!

167
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,020
It's still not too late for you. Become one of my soldiers.

168
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,760
We are ready to wage war on 
the north, the west, and the south.

169
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,150
The time has come for 
the continent to be united.

170
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,530
Not interested.

171
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,450
In that case, die!

172
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,600
Your pupils will be 
following you soon as well.

173
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,050
What are you doing?! 
I am your superior officer!

174
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,110
You too?!

175
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,000
Izumi-san!

176
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,760
Where's... Ed?

177
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,100
By now, both brothers should be at the place that was written about in that journal.

178
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,610
You all believed... in those boys?

179
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,600
Believing in and protecting children 
is the job of an adult.

180
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,370
That's what someone once told me.

181
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,900
Rose?

182
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,340
Ed...

183
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,910
You finally came.

184
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,300
Now, that should 
teach you a lesson.

185
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,550
Don't start any fights 
with these guys.

186
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,210
You really don't ever learn 
unless you get hurt.

187
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,680
Something the matter?

188
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,680
I think I just figured something out.

189
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,680
Figured what out?

190
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,660
Hughes-san said something 
before he died.

191
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,480
"What if everything was backwards?"

192
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,790
I never understood what he meant.

193
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,400
And you figured it out?

194
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:07,910
We've been thinking that the homunculi 
were trying to create a Philosopher's Stone.

195
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,660
But what if it was 
the other way around?

196
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,270
They wait until it is just barely completed, and then take it away.

197
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,560
Then they eliminate everyone 
who can prove it ever happened.

198
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,590
What's left is a rumor that says if you come near the Philosopher's Stone, you'll be destroyed.

199
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,640
In time, people become afraid of the Philosopher's Stone...

200
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,780
So they'll keep away from it?

201
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,890
But that would almost make them good people, wouldn't it?

202
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,110
They're making sure people stay out of danger, after all.

203
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,900
What's more,

204
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,900
no matter how dangerous it is,

205
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,000
I'll bet that people will 
still go on looking for it.

206
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,920
I wonder how Edward-san and his brother are doing.

207
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,910
I'm sure they're getting along fine.

208
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,400
That much is certain.

209
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,590
Pain that teaches a lesson, huh?

210
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:00,510
But God is the only one who can teach that kind of lesson.

211
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,640
R-Rose, what are you doing here?

212
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,280
I've been waiting for you 
a long, long time.

213
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,640
Ed, I...

214
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,710
Rose...

215
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,400
Rose, was Al brought here?

216
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,390
What exactly is this place?

217
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,660
My baby...

218
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,250
My baby...

219
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,970
You should have danced with her.

220
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:42,750
She's been waiting for you ever since we fled here.

221
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,960
You're despicable.

222
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,470
Lyra, you brought Rose here?

223
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,330
There's an old city that 
only alchemists know of.

224
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,100
That's what Dante-sensei told me.

225
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:58,670
Speaking of Dante-san, I still 
haven't heard how she was killed.

226
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,760
She was killed by 
that homunculus Greed.

227
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,980
I thought I told you.

228
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,150
That is a lie.

229
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,650
A lie?

230
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,930
The transmutation circle that was left in Dante-san's house

231
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,380
was one that could keep 
a homunculus from moving.

232
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:16,240
There were bones from the man 
on whom Greed was based.

233
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,350
Greed shouldn't have been able to 
take action against Dante-san.

234
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,690
Are you sure? 
Still, Dante-san definitely is dead.

235
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,410
But supposing that what was there

236
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,600
was nothing more than a shell 
that her soul had sloughed off...

237
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,930
What are you saying?

238
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,980
Let's suppose there were people who used the power of the Philosopher's Stone

239
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,810
to move from one body to another 
and who have lived for hundreds of years.

240
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:40,520
Back there, you made it 
look like you were dead

241
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,140
and then took over Lyra's body. 
Isn't that right?!

242
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,190
Ed, stop! I am—

243
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,330
That was close.

244
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,900
When did you see the gate, Lyra?

245
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,390
You transmuted without 
using a transmutation circle.

246
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,340
That's my answer, Dante!

247
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,050
When did you figure it out, 
Edward Elric?

248
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,850
Then it's true?

249
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,500
I've really come to like this body.

250
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,560
So then, what number is she?

251
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,190
Who knows? 
It hasn't been ten yet, though.

252
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:25,190
After all, I have to use the 
Philosopher's Stone each time.

253
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,760
Did you wipe out the residents of this city to make your Philosopher's Stone?

254
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,720
Yes, the same as with the nation to the east, 
which was destroyed overnight.

255
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,980
I should mention, though, 
that I was not the one who made them.

256
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,500
Hohenheim of Light...

257
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,260
You shouldn't address 
your own father like that.

258
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:48,300
So he's prolonged his life 
the same way? For what reason?

259
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,670
Because we deserve to.

260
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,060
You covertly create 
the Philosopher's Stone

261
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,240
just so you can use it to extend your own lives.

262
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,330
You think you can 
get away with that?!

263
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,440
Humans cannot use 
the Philosopher's Stone.

264
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,040
Is that why, when people fail to 
complete a Philosopher's Stone,

265
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,760
you obliterate everything 
and leave behind the story

266
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,870
that destruction befalls those who get too close to the Philosopher's Stone?

267
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:14,270
Yes, to keep people from getting 
too close to the Philosopher's Stone.

268
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,180
And for those who 
still get too close,

269
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,880
we take it from them at the last minute 
and use it carefully.

270
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,240
After all, there's no telling what humans would do

271
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,730
if they were given a 
Philosopher's Stone, right?

272
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:30,630
I do it to keep foolish people from destroying the world.

273
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:34,690
You could say that I have extended my life to protect the world.

274
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:38,560
To keep humans from doing anything foolish with the Philosopher's Stone.

275
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,140
Cut the crap! You're human too!

276
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,690
Not anymore.

277
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,650
Lust!

278
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:50,480
Lust! Where's Lust?!

279
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,480
What a shame.

280
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,230
I was looking forward to entering this girl's body

281
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:57,200
and making love to 
Hohenheim's son.

282
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,330
Rose's body is next, is it?!

283
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,660
Yes. I have obtained a 
Philosopher's Stone again, and all.

284
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,670
Al?! Where's Al?!

285
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,420
Where's Lust?! 
What happened to Lust?!

286
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,520
Try asking him, Gluttony.

287
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,260
Lust!

288
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,840
Lust! Where's Lust?!

289
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,100
She's dead. 
And it was my fault.

290
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,040
Lust... is dead?

291
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,350
Yeah. Your pal Wrath sealed her up.

292
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,320
Gluttony?

293
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,260
Lust...

294
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,790
Gluttony!

295
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,910
Lust...

296
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,960
Here I come!

297
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,930
I knew it.

298
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,940
Repeatedly bonding just your soul is not something you can continue doing forever.

299
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,000
Equivalent exchange!

300
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,570
That's the backlash from performing that idiocy over and over!

301
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,140
Equivalent exchange?

302
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,150
Do you still believe in 
that childish theory?

303
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,900
It's no theory! 
It's the law of alchemy—

304
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,440
no, of the whole world!

305
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,560
You're the one who 
said so, aren't you?

306
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,620
That in order to obtain anything, 
it requires something of equal value?

307
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,910
That's something that 
only a child would say.

308
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:33,880
Like "make everything equal," or "that wouldn't be fair."

309
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,300
However, there's no such thing as equivalent exchange.

310
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,700
That's absurd!

311
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,060
There is a cost required in order for you to obtain something...

312
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,410
In that case, if you reverse it—

313
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,270
if you pay a price, you are certain to obtain something, right?

314
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:50,290
That's right. That's why people 
put forth an effort to pay the price.

315
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,110
But there's something 
strange about that.

316
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,140
After all, even if you 
pay the same price,

317
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,360
you can't always necessarily obtain the same thing.

318
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,360
Well, that's...

319
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,230
There's the State Alchemist Exam, right?

320
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:08,950
In order to pass it, many people 
spend time studying. That's a cost.

321
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,550
But only a handful of people 
actually pass it.

322
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,720
Everyone may start out the same 
when they learn alchemy,

323
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,380
but huge differences arise in their actual abilities.

324
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,970
And people's lives 
are not all equal, either.

325
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:33,240
If nobody does anything, 
that baby is going to die, right?

326
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,140
Stop!

327
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,020
It really would be easy 
for me to kill it.

328
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,070
If I do, was the baby 
born only in order to die?

329
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:44,650
The baby is paying the price of desperately trying to survive.

330
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:48,080
Yet is death the only thing 
they're going to get for that?

331
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,070
Elsewhere, there are people who kill others 
and continue to go on living.

332
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:57,060
No matter how hard you may try to live, when it's time for you to die, you die.

333
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,120
When you compare that to 
people who don't make any effort

334
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,040
yet are afforded riches and power 
and live lives of happiness,

335
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,450
it's quite unfair, isn't it?

336
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,170
The world is quite cruel.

337
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,370
Which is why you might say 
it's so beautiful.

338
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,850
Cut the sophistry!

339
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,390
My baby...

340
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,990
Equivalent exchange is an excuse that the weak use to comfort themselves.

341
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:30,670
They tell themselves that by paying a price, it's supposed to make themselves happier.

342
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,000
This baby doesn't 
have to make any excuses!

343
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,210
You're his son, all right.

344
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,300
Ouch...

345
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,640
What is this? 
What's going on here?

346
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,780
My eyes...

347
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,230
Who is this?

348
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,270
What's that?

349
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,210
Edward-kun!

350
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,710
What are you doing?! 
It's an air raid!

351
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,130
Hurry up!

352
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:26,720
Wait! Pop, what are you doing here?! 
What is this place?!

353
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,720
"Pop"? Edward-kun, 
what are you talking about?

354
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,340
I thought you were at 
Dante-san's place!

355
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,210
What is this place?!

356
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,730
What's happened to me?!

357
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,230
My face... my hand?

358
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,570
Are you my son Edward?

359
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,630
Of course I am!

360
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,950
What are you doing here?

361
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,290
I don't know...

362
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,080
Let's go! They're coming!

363
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,240
Who do you mean, "they"?!

364
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,310
Zeppelins!

365
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,600
Zeppelins?

366
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,220
As my tears well up,

367
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,220
afuredasu namida nara

368
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,390
I don't have to stop them now

369
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,390
ima wa tomenakute ii

370
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:17,710
I don't have to stop them now

371
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:17,710
ima wa tomenakute ii

372
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,500
At the end of all the grief,

373
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,500
kanashimi no saigo ni wa

374
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,380
the light is sure to shine through

375
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,380
hikari ga sashikomu hazu

376
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:33,370
Stay... stay... stay... stay...

377
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:42,680
It's true, I cannot see you now,

378
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:42,680
sou, ima anata ni aenai kedo

379
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,780
but by hiding the heartache,

380
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,780
setsunai omoi kakushite

381
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,900
I can become stronger

382
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,900
tsuyoku nareru,

383
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:58,220
And I will go on making sure of that

384
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:58,220
motto tashikameteyuku no

385
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,730
As my tears well up,

386
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,730
afuredasu namida nara

387
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,460
I don't have to stop them now

388
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,460
ima wa tomenakute ii

389
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,230
Nor will I forget the pain

390
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,230
yasashisa ni kawatteku

391
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,490
as it becomes kindness

392
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,490
itami mo wasurenai

393
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:14,930
as it becomes kindness

394
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:14,930
itami mo wasurenai

395
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:22,630
That which I ruined in my haste,

396
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:22,630
isogisugite kowashitekita mono

397
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,710
I will take back so that

398
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,710
torimodosu no

399
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:33,130
I can walk on as I would

400
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:33,130
watashirashiku aruku tame ni

401
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,860
for you

402
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,110
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

403
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,920
Death

404
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,870
Death

405
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,940
Death

406
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,800
