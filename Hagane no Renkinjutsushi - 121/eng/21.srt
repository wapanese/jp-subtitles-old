1
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,910
What's wrong? 
Suddenly, you're not moving so well.

2
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,160
It looks like an artificially created soul isn't quite perfect.

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,630
Is this what happens when you find out what you really are?

4
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,440
No... I'm...

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,420
I'm...

6
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,880
Alphonse Elric!

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,570
I told you, there's no 
proof of that. Yeah?

8
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,350
Accept it. You'll feel better.

9
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,940
If that's so,

10
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,940
what about you?!

11
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,910
You have memories of when 
you were alive. Which means...

12
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,760
I'm so pleased.

13
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,500
The fools keep coming 
one after another today.

14
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,590
You asked about me?

15
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,130
It's simple.

16
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,620
I love cutting up live people,

17
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,100
and I like killing people 
so much, I can't stand it.

18
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,530
I kill; therefore, I am!

19
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,160
therefore,

20
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,160

That's all the evidence I need!

84
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,950
There is no need for you to prove your existence.

85
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,840
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

86
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,440
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

87
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:57,490
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

Let's get started, ready, steady, go!

You!

134
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,740
An acquaintance of yours?! That's dirty! Who knew you still had friends around?!

135
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,010
Friends?

136
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,080
What, then?!

137
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,670
What the?! What happened?

138
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,430
You have a wretched body as well?

139
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,310
May you find peace with God...

140
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,010
Huh?

141
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,020
What is that doing there?!

142
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,390
What about this?

143
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,570
Huh?

144
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,200
By any chance, 
do you not know what that is?

145
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,070
Answer me!

146
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,950
What are you saying this is?!

147
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,620
I see, you want to 
find out that badly.

148
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,690
Let's see now...

149
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,210
No, I'm not saying.

150
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,570
It's been 130 years, huh?

151
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,970
This is where they keep the animals for experimentation, huh?

152
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,190
Come with me, 
or go play in hell, you choose.

153
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,240
Decide now!

154
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,320
These devices are set 
so I can bust things up

155
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,510
and make myself 
all gone at any time!

156
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,560
Now then, it's about time 
I went bye-bye.

157
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:13,890
Wait!

158
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:20,490
If you want to find out about your arm, you have to come all the way inside here!

159
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,050
He got away.

160
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,760
Hey...

161
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,680
I'm sorry!

162
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,370
Where are you going?

163
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,870
If you're here, 
then Fullmetal must be inside.

164
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,460
W-Wait!

165
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,000
Wait up, I say!

166
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,770
What was that tremor 
a moment ago?

167
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,430
Good question.

168
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:59,190
However, there are explosives set throughout this building, for destroying evidence.

169
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,260
With that shock just now, 
there's no telling when they will go off.

170
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,810
And I still don't know anything!

171
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,700
I will keep my promise.

172
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,450
You came here in search of the secrets of the Philosopher's Stone, right?

173
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,850
It's not as though I know everything, but I will lead you to the entrance.

174
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,870
But what do we do 
with your brother?

175
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,170
We can't just leave him here.

176
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,350
You don't need to worry.

177
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,430
Finish me off, immediately.

178
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,330
I told you, 
I'm not killing anyone!

179
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,610
You said we were people, right?

180
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,250
In that case, tell me,

181
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,440
how am I supposed to 
go on living in this body?

182
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,650
Well, I...

183
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,740
Don't attach him! Don't attach him!

184
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,410
Are you implying I should join with my brother,

185
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,600
and together, continue guarding this deserted house?!

186
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,160
In this unaging, hollow body?

187
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,670
You could give this up, right?

188
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,080
And what, go outside?

189
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,930
Would guys like us have the freedom to just wander around on our own outside?

190
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:15,000
Hang on. My own brother has the same kind of body as you.

191
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,780
You see, it's in order to 
return him back to normal

192
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,930
that I'm searching for 
the Philosopher's Stone.

193
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,100
If I ever find it...

194
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,420
If we were ever returned to being human, we would just be executed again.

195
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,810
Do you understand?

196
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,810
Even if we became human, 
we would just get killed again.

197
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:38,550
Or are you saying that you would turn 
a blind eye to us, a couple of serial killers?

198
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,410
But still!

199
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,380
Would you treat us as humans?

200
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,600
It sounds admirable in word,

201
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,610
but if you were to treat us 
as though we were humans,

202
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,200
when we can only go on 
living in this form,

203
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,230
do you realize how cruel that would be to us?!

204
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,660
You idiot! What are you doing?!

205
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,390
Just shut up and watch.

206
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,780
What are you saying?! 
He's your younger brother!

207
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,880
I'm glad that you 
regard him as a person.

208
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,040
That's why he can no longer 
go back to being Number 48.

209
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,390
This is the only thing 
he can do as a person.

210
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,850
That isn't true!

211
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,910
Brother, I'm going on ahead.

212
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,370
Stop!

213
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,350
My brother, once I fulfill my promise, 
I will come at once.

214
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,810
What were you thinking?

215
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,990
What were you guys thinking?

216
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,230
It was the only choice 
he could make.

217
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,900
If I treated you guys as people, all you could do is die.

218
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,240
In that case, what was 
I supposed to do for him?

219
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,760
There are many problems in this world for which there is no way to answer.

220
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,780
I'm going to return 
Al back to normal.

221
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,970
I'm not about to allow Al to go through this.

222
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,110
Let's go.

223
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,030
We're really going to 
let these guys out?

224
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,740
That was the order. I hear they're 
going to be used in military research.

225
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,490
Even though they have life sentences,

226
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,070
it wouldn't be surprising 
if they were really executed.

227
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,450
Is that an earthquake?

228
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:51,750
That is the sound of the building collapsing due to explosives.

229
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,830
Ah, what a pleasant sound...

230
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,200
Kimbly!

231
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,910
Ah, that brings back memories of 
the extermination assault on Ishbal.

232
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,720
Come on out! 
You've been summoned!

233
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,910
You blew away both 
friend and foe there,

234
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,150
you miserable mad bomber, Kimbly...

235
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:19,640
Such a pleasant sound. 
It reverberates in the pit of my stomach.

236
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,330
This is how far the former 
Crimson Alchemist has fallen.

237
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,000
Now all we need is for Envy to gather the ingredients.

238
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,700
How long have we been 
waiting for this, I wonder...

239
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,710
Lust!

240
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,980
What's this?

241
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,350
It's him! It's him!

242
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,430
<i>Him</i>?

243
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,060
You don't mean...

244
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,530
Greed?

245
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,800
It looks like we'll have to hurry,

246
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,030
before there are any 
unwanted intrusions.

247
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,250
There aren't any more 
weird traps, right?

248
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,700
There haven't been any intruders who have gotten in this far.

249
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,030
You mean, because they were all dealt with by you guys?

250
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,270
So, who was it that 
placed you in that form?

251
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,290
What, you were lying about the traps?!

252
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,930
This isn't a trap.

253
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,090
Dammit!

254
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,780
What?

255
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,330
It's the one who 
created these Chimera.

256
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,890
There are still people here?

257
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,140
If you can call him a person.

258
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,650
The Chimera?

259
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,490
This thing created the Chimera?

260
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,110
Not all of them.

261
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,630
It's been a long time, Edward-kun.

262
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,130
Tucker...

263
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,580
The Sewing Life... Alchemist...

264
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,000
Why?!

265
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,210
Why are you here?!

266
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,840
We are here because we are 
supposed to have been executed.

267
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,720
It shouldn't seem strange that there would be those who are living as Chimera here too.

268
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,660
That's not what I'm talking about!

269
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,830
Nina...

270
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,730
Nina...

271
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,740
That girl is dead because of you!

272
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,080
Why are you still alive?!

273
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,240
For Nina.

274
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,040
I know well 
how you must feel now.

275
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,130
Um, can't I ask you to stop going after Brother now?

276
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,150
It is the will of Ishbala.

277
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,750
He is an accursed alchemist—

278
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,260
and what's worse, he now 
seeks the Philosopher's Stone.

279
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,880
Why is alchemy so bad?

280
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,060
I mean, your own 
right arm has a circle,

281
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,480
though it's one 
I've never seen before.

282
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,610
It is a brand I received when I took on 
the calling to destroy all State Alchemists.

283
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,030
And as for the Philosopher's Stone,

284
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,330
he isn't looking for it 
to use it in battle.

285
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:55,430
It's in order to return 
my body to me.

286
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,040
You don't know the terror 
of the Philosopher's Stone!

287
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,520
We do!

288
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,300
There's a legend that destruction befalls those who seek the Philosopher's Stone, right?

289
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,080
But if we were afraid of that, 
we'd never get our hands on anything.

290
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,530
Come to mention it, I heard that Ishbal also perished

291
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:14,210
because it came too close 
to the Philosopher's Stone.

292
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,260
No!

293
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,950
Ishbal did not perish.

294
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,480
It was destroyed!

295
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,270
Brother!

296
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,280
Brother! Open up!

297
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,250
Brother!

298
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,970
Brother, is it true?

299
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,650
You've tried alchemy?

300
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,440
I failed.

301
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,550
It cannot be done this way.

302
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,970
However,

303
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,780
there is still the Philosopher's Stone.

304
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:59,560
Brother, alchemy is a heretical practice that alters the creation that God has given us!

305
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,640
But...

306
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,060
our god, Ishbala...

307
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,370
will not bring her 
back to life for us.

308
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,800
Brother!

309
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,220
The military...

310
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,670
They mean business...

311
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,150
Brother, it's too dangerous here!

312
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,060
Brother!

313
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,150
I have finally begun to see...

314
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,100
What the Philosopher's Stone is...

315
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,280
Why Ishbala has forbidden it to us...

316
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,940
Brother...

317
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,400
Stop this already!

318
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,750
The enemy is trying to destroy us 
with this power of the Devil!

319
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,910
Yes, it's true.

320
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,540
Ishbal will be destroyed.

321
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:08,540
That is something that has been preordained.

322
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,010
I believed that if I could obtain the Philosopher's Stone,

323
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,150
she would come back to life

324
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,050
and Ishbal would be saved.

325
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,490
However, it is for that purpose

326
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,470
that Ishbal must be destroyed.

327
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,060
Brother...

328
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,060
Brother!

329
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,580
Brother!

330
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,600
Scar-san...

331
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:58,370
I know that the Philosopher's Stone 
can be made from people's bodies.

332
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,100
We came to verify that.

333
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,760
If that's true, then we...

334
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,310
My, my...

335
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,800
There sure are 
a lot of intruders today.

336
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,340
Who are you?

337
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,940
You!

338
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,490
Why are you making that face?

339
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,240
My brother...

340
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,580
Did he succeed?

341
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,320
What do you mean?

342
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,990
Can I eat them?

343
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,150
The armored one would be bad for your stomach.

344
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,290
I'll do my best!

345
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,590
Homunculus...

346
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,050
Homunculus?

347
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,800
They couldn't be...!

348
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,560
So the military falsified your execution

349
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,310
and had you create Chimeras here?

350
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,560
Not just Chimeras...

351
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,520
I'm doing research on 
a number of things...

352
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,070
that cannot be made 
public knowledge.

353
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:03,580
Spirit bonding, and other tricks 
you can't do with ordinary alchemy.

354
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,430
You may have become a Chimera,

355
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:08,080
but you still have your complete memory from when you were human.

356
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,030
Who has that kind of skill?

357
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:15,090
Doctor Marcoh? 
Basque Grand? Someone else?

358
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,430
Answer me! 
Who the hell runs this place?!

359
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,600
Please don't look at them.

360
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,190
They're quite bashful.

361
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,490
Nina?

362
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,200
They still cannot keep their shape when exposed to the open air.

363
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,230
There's no way you're able to 
perform human transmutation.

364
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,190
You created a Chimera... 
to look like Nina?

365
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,000
But each time, I failed,

366
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,480
and in the end, 
I wound up in this form.

367
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,350
However, I'm just one step away...

368
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,230
Just one step away...

369
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,070
One... step away?

370
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,100
The unfinished Philosopher's Stone material that Doctor Marcoh had...

371
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:10,120
You must already know that 
it alone has considerable power.

372
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:21,930
If this large amount of unfinished material could be completely refined,

373
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,950
you would have a Philosopher's Stone.

374
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,440
Too slow!

375
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,950
However, no one 
has yet been successful.

376
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,830
It is impossible...

377
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,600
for any ordinary alchemist.

378
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,000
I am...

379
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,880
I am...

380
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,490
no ordinary alchemist.

381
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,790
We are still crying out

382
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,790
bokura wa ima demo sakenderu

383
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,850
You squeeze your right hand, as if to reassure yourself

384
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,850
tashikameru you ni nigirishimeta migite

385
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,700
Go on, take those annoying rules and dash them away!

386
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,700
uzattai housoku o buchikowashite yuke

387
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,840
If it comes down to having to rest your wounded feet,

388
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,840
kizutsuita ashi o yasumaseru gurai nara

389
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,730
you've gotta keep moving forward, if only just a step!

390
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,730
tatta ippo demo koko kara susume

391
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,500
We've pushed our way

392
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,500
through the twisting winds

393
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,500
yuganda kaze o kaki wakete

394
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,630
and gotten beyond the cold sky

395
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,630
tsumetai sora o oikoshite

396
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,400
Yet we still continue to wander

397
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,400
soredemo mada samayoi tsuzuketeru

398
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,570
We always find ourselves crying out

399
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,570
bokura wa itsudemo sakenderu

400
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:11,910
Just continuing to believe is not the answer

401
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:11,910
shinji tsuzukeru dake ga kotae janai

402
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,620
We must bare our weaknesses and wounds,

403
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,620
yowasa mo kizu mo sarake dashite

404
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,300
and continue to struggle,

405
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,300
or nothing will ever turn out!

406
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,300
mogaki tsuzukenakereba hajimaranai

407
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:29,000
Break on through to the other side of the door!

408
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:29,000
tsukiyabure tobira no mukou e

409
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,600
To the other side of the door!

410
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,600
tobira no mukou e

411
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,340
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

412
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,000
Created Human

413
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,950
Created Human

414
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,020
Created Human

415
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,580
Episode 22: "Created Human"

416
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,520
Homunculus—

417
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,570
a pseudo-human, 
created through alchemy.

418
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:53,030
But they exist only in legends.
