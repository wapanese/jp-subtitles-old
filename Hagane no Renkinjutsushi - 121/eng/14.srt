00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,040
Town of Liore

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,660
If the Minister can really cause miracles with his Philosopher's Stone,

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,660
then why did it turn out like this?

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,980
Please cease fighting!

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,840
Please cease fighting!

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,920
Send out the Minister!

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,920
Please cease fighting!

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,980
Give us the Minister!

12
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,310
Rose, is it okay that 
we're not fighting?

13
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:50,820
Against whom?

14
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,320
How foolish.

15
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,060
Humans are foolish beyond saving.

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,620
Foolish! Foolish!

17
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,970
With things going this well, 
such foolishness is refreshing.

18
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,250
Well, well, if it isn't 
the almighty Minister.

19
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,590
Almighty!

20
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,260
All I did was incite the 
members of the order,

21
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,780
and the believers 
began killing each other.

22
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,810
And the military is just adding fuel to 
the fire by trying to quell the disorder.

23
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,810
No matter how many times they repeat themselves, 
they never know enough to learn.

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,880
Humans are foolish, 
miserable creatures.

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,820
All of this to create 
a Philosopher's Stone.

26
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,820
And now, I can finally...

27
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,000
return to this adorable form.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,630
That again? You enjoy making yourself up as young, huh?

29
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,980
What else can I do? I've forgotten 
what I originally looked like, after all.

30
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,220
Wh-What's going on here? 
The Minister...

31
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,150
What have you done with the real Minister?!

32
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,240
What do we do?

33
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,960
Why don't we just tell him the truth? The Minister has long since—

34
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,250
Can I eat him?

35
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,760
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

36
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,380
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

37
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,400
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

38
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,480
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

39
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,150
Ready, steady, can't hold me back

40
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,500
Ready, steady, give me good luck

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,800
Ready, steady, never look back

42
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,200
Let's get started, ready, steady, go!

43
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,350

Destruction's Right Hand

83
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,420
Come to mention it,

84
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:21,730
I got some information saying 
that guy is headed from Central to East.

85
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,860
You mean the State Alchemist killer?

86
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,920
The Flame Colonel is in East City, along with...

87
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,290
By now, the Fullmetal pipsqueak is making his stay there.

88
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,040
Really...

89
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,510
Right now,

90
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,880
that boy is the closest one 
to our goal.

91
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,260
We can't have that guy 
just going around on his own.

92
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,360
Lust, that was delicious!

93
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,010
Wipe your mouth, Gluttony.

94
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,930
Right, right...

95
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,020
So, what was this guy named?

96
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,020
"Scar"?

97
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,900
The scarred man?

98
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,280
We don't know his 
real identity, after all.

99
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,990
We've got eyewitness testimony saying he has a large scar on his forehead,

100
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,280
so that's what we call him.

101
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,560
And he's the one who killed a number of State Alchemists in Central?

102
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,290
Nine of them.

103
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,930
Four just in Central.

104
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,290
If you count the whole country,

105
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,880
nine State Alchemists 
have fallen by his hand.

106
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,440
If you include other 
personnel around them,

107
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,010
it's well into the dozens.

108
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,600
Judging from the wounds, it looks like 
they blew up from the inside.

109
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,520
As far as his weapons and his objectives go, 
we don't know a thing.

110
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,130
And so, the folks at the Central Command Center panicked.

111
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,430
They made the excuse that 
they were escorting the Führer

112
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,440
and went on this trip <i>en masse</i>, then?

113
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,440
So the killer won't come to this backwoods place, huh?

114
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,960
You're here, and all.

115
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,780
Those who demoted you 
three years ago are aware...

116
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,250
of your abilities.

117
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,290
Now I'm beginning to 
want to run away too.

118
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,850
The issue is who 
his next target will be.

119
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,100
Pardon me...

120
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,300
Oh, sorry, but I have a cute little daughter who's about to turn three—

121
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,800
Telephone for you.

122
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,670
Oh, thanks.

123
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,810
Yes, hello, this is Hughes.

124
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,590
Major?

125
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,580
Understood.

126
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,810
The body of one of the soldiers patrolling East City Station has been found.

127
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,820
Blown up from the inside?

128
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,050
Doctor Marcoh?

129
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,980
You mean Mauro-sensei?

130
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,600
No, <i>Marcoh</i>.

131
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,550
But there's only one doctor in this village, 
and that's Mauro-sensei.

132
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,920
As you can see, the folks along this road are poor,

133
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,230
and we had to take half a day 
just to get to East City to see a doctor.

134
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,740
He's a nice fellow.

135
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,270
He'll make sure to see even patients who were given up on as incurable elsewhere.

136
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,860
When I got my leg caught under a tractor and it looked like I was going to die,

137
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,960
he fixed me up just right.

138
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,850
When he was treating him, right? There was this flash of light!

139
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,160
Right, right!

140
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,780
Light...

141
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,190
That's alchemy all right.

142
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,790
It's Doctor Marcoh.

143
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,460
But he's on the run 
from the military, right?

144
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,930
Why would he become a doctor? There'd be stories about him.

145
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,300
This is awful! 
I'm getting straw inside me!

146
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,750
Who is that?

147
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,480
He's a State Alchemist—

148
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,690
one of those who was with the Führer when they came from Central.

149
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,580
But why is he here?

150
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,650
Did he follow us?

151
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:51,480
The Colonel said he never reported Marcoh's whereabouts to Central.

152
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,670
Let's hurry! Marcoh's house should be close by.

153
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,730
H-Hold on! We just wanted...

154
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,840
A State Alchemist, you say?! 
Have you come to take me back?!

155
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,850
Er, you're the Crystal Alchemist, Doctor Marcoh-san, right?

156
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,770
I don't want to go back there! Please! I couldn't stand that!

157
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,600
It's not like that! Hear us out!

158
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,770
Look, that's dangerous!

159
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,980
Or have you come to silence me?!

160
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,930
You think you can kill me? I... I...

161
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,490
Al...

162
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,910
It's all right.

163
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,750
Even if you kill me, I won't die.

164
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,500
You're...

165
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,680
I see, you're the Fullmetal Alchemist...

166
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,730
No, that would be me! 
I'm him, actually.

167
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:20,030
I deserted the battlefield,

168
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:24,540
and when I did, I stole the research materials that I had at the time.

169
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,250
The military is probably 
still after those materials.

170
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,000
That's it!

171
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,020
The truth is, we're looking into human transmutation—

172
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,420
I can't...

173
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,930
show you anything.

174
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,320
Orders from above notwithstanding, 
I stained my hands with that research.

175
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,940
And then, it was used in the 
massacre of the Eastern Rebellion.

176
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,660
Massacre?

177
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,690
You mean the uprising at Ishbal?

178
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,520
It was terrible.

179
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,250
It was a truly terrible battle.

180
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,120
Children... women...

181
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,120
They were all killed.

182
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,620
There was no justifiable reason for it.

183
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,620
It was reason enough that they were the people of Ishbal and defied the military.

184
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,380
I could never fully make up for what 
I did there even if I gave up my own life.

185
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,270
Even so, I decided to do all that I can, which is why I am a doctor here.

186
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,630
Go back.

187
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,380
I'm a State Alchemist! 
I have a right to see your research!

188
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,610
As little as you are?

189
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,460
I'll bet you were blinded by 
the abundant research funding

190
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,310
and numerous privileges, 
so you got yourself certified.

191
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,110
What foolishness.

192
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,880
If you were there during 
the rebellion, you would also—

193
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,700
I know!

194
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,250
I know what we're doing is stupid. But even so...

195
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,460
Marcoh-san...

196
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,970
About five years ago, you treated 
the babies at Xenotime, didn't you?

197
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,110
The babies from that time are now doing fine.

198
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,580
Brother!

199
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,030
No transmutation circle?!

200
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:20,280
Is this the red water of Xenotime? 
No, this appears to be much clearer.

201
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,210
Stop!

202
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,210
Brother!

203
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,990
Brother, this is wrong!

204
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,280
Let go of me!

205
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,240
Brother!

206
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,660
Let go of me, I said!

207
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,950
It's not a liquid?

208
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,420
Brother, it...

209
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,780
It looks like that thing that the Minister at Liore had.

210
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,020
The Sage's Stone, the Celestial Stone...

211
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,730
the Great Elixir, the Red Tincture, the Fifth Element...

212
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,890
Just as it is called by many names,

213
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,740
its form is also not limited to that of a stone.

214
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,860
Brigadier General Grand...

215
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,650
Brigadier General?

216
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,580
My, you've moved up in the world.

217
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,020
Crystal Alchemist,

218
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,630
you will turn over the Philosopher's Stone, along with all of your materials.

219
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,090
Philosopher's Stone?! That?!

220
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,430
At best, it is an experimentally produced item.

221
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,720
There's no telling when it will 
reach its limit and become unusable.

222
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,120
It's an unstable, defective product, 
and it's different from the genuine article.

223
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,990
But during the rebellion, 
it did augment our abilities,

224
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,710
and we displayed tremendous power!

225
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,800
So, are you saying 
that in the past,

226
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,460
the military researched 
the Philosopher's Stone?

227
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:58,990
Never mind that it isn't perfect. 
If that was made by human hands...

228
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,640
it means that it's possible to 
create a Philosopher's Stone as well!

229
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,220
Where is the manufacturing technique?!

230
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,560
What do you mean to do 
once you see it, Fullmetal Alchemist?

231
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,210
The research is top secret 
and falls under my jurisdiction.

232
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,630
I cannot permit you 
to see the materials.

233
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,150
Let's go!

234
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,950
L-Let go of me! No! No!

235
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,460
Please don't! Forgive me!

236
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,450
I don't want to go back there!

237
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,060
I don't want to go back!

238
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,900
I've had enough of it! 
Please forgive me!

239
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,580
I can't stand it!

240
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,440
I can't stand anymore!

241
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,280
It's just like that other time...

242
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,260
Brother!

243
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,650
I may not have grown at all,

244
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,190
but I can't let my heart stay stunted!

245
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,670
Who's that?

246
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,670
Iron Blood Alchemist, Basque Grand...

247
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,430
Too bad for you!

248
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:34,430
I now have this!

249
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,190
Stop!

250
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,700
<i>That's...</i>

251
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,780
<i>That's the guy I saw three years ago 
in Central. I'm sure of it...</i>

252
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,030
<i>Never mind that! This is bad!</i>

253
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,170
<i>My instincts are telling me to run,</i>

254
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,670
<i>but my legs won't move!</i>

255
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:13,100
Crystal Alchemist, Doctor Marcoh...

256
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,050
I heard that you were dead.

257
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,020
I must take special care...

258
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,020
to kill you!

259
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,700
You're...

260
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,730
I see. This must be fate.

261
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,200
In the name of God, 
thou shalt perish!

262
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,720
Edward-kun!

263
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,250
What are you giving up for?! Run!

264
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,800
Fullmetal Alchemist!

265
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,330
You will not escape either!

266
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:47,090
<i>He knows me? 
What's going on here?</i>

267
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,880
<i>I've done plenty of stuff 
to get people mad at me,</i>

268
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,220
<i>but I've never given anyone 
a reason to come after my life!</i>

269
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,220
Brother, this way!

270
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,000
Who are you?!

271
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,640
Why are you after us?!

272
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,980
If you are creators, then there must also be a destroyer.

273
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,380
Edward-kun, leave me behind and run!

274
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,700
You have a fine look in your eyes.

275
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,580
My older brother also had the same look in his eyes.

276
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:07,730
Eyes that were strong, that peered far away 
into the endless distance...

277
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,130
Three years ago, was it?

278
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,800
I was glad to hear that you had 
given up being a State Alchemist.

279
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,180
That's too bad. However!

280
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:24,690
Too slow!

281
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,270
Brother!

282
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,200
Al!

283
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,640
Make no mistake.

284
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,610
I meant to destroy a human body, 
so you got away with just that crack.

285
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,210
Stay out of this.

286
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,580
My only enemy is the State Alchemist.

287
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,500
Why?

288
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,210
Why are you after us?

289
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,440
Alchemists are those who take things 
from their natural form

290
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,400
and transform them into something grotesque.

291
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,130
That is to say, they profane God, the creator of all things.

292
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,040
As an agent of God,

293
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,440
I am he who hands down his judgment.

294
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,140
I'm an alchemist too! 
I may not have the state's certification...

295
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,200
Why do you wish to die?

296
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,480
You mentioned your older brother a moment ago, right?

297
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,410
Then you should understand!

298
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,090
There's no way anyone could watch their brother get killed.

299
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,920
Even you—

300
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,920
I do understand!

301
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:38,730
The way I felt when I had to watch as 
my brother was killed before my eyes...

302
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,140
That is exactly...

303
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,930
why I must now...!

304
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,890
I told you, you're too slow.

305
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,830
Automail?

306
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,620
So your right arm brings forth 
nothing but destruction as well?

307
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,880
Don't go lumping my 
right arm in with yours!

308
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,970
A State Alchemist?

309
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,530
Are you here to take Marcoh-san?!

310
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:41,520
I'm sorry I'm late. I was assigned by the Lt. Colonel to guard you.

311
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,250
By Lt. Colonel Hughes?

312
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:50,560
Agent of God, you say? In that case, try passing judgment upon me.

313
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,190
For I am the Strong Arm Alchemist,

314
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,710
Alex Louis Armstrong!

315
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,500
What a fine day this is!

316
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,970
That you would come forward 
and save me the trouble of finding you...

317
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,680
Could this be the grace of God?

318
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,400
Allow me to show you 
the artistic alchemy

319
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,860
that has been passed down among 
the Armstrong family for generations!

320
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,490
Another shot!

321
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,600
As you can see, 
there are only children here!

322
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,040
There aren't any of the guerillas you're looking for!

323
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,420
Does this mean you've abandoned 
the so-called teachings of Cornello?

324
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,850
Fine.

325
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:44,620
Tell us the location of the faction that's resisting military rule!

326
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,550
No!

327
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,060
We came to liberate this town from Cornello! 
Don't you understand?!

328
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,050
This town is our home.

329
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,660
We're going to move forward,

330
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,050
even if it's only a little at a time, under our own power.

331
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,780
Our legs are fine, after all!

332
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,090
You dropped this.

333
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,120
You didn't think about 
running away with this?

334
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,100
You used it to treat people in that clinic, right?

335
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:41,610
I can't forget the looks on the faces of 
those people who told us about you today.

336
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,410
That belongs to those people, and so do you.

337
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,870
Can you walk?

338
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,810
Okay, let's go.

339
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:59,130
Someplace where neither that guy nor the military will follow us.

340
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,750
Can we escape them?

341
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,090
You still have your legs, don't you?

342
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,850
You squeeze your right hand, as if to reassure yourself

343
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,850
tashikameru you ni nigirishimeta migite

344
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,700
Go on, take those annoying rules and dash them away!

uzattai housoku o buchikowashite yuke

346

kizutsuita ashi o yasumaseru gurai nara

348
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,730
you've gotta keep moving forward, if only just a step!

00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,500
through the twisting winds

352
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,500
yuganda kaze o kaki wakete

353
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,630
and gotten beyond the cold sky

354
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,630
tsumetai sora o oikoshite

355
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,400
Yet we still continue to wander

356
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,400
soredemo mada samayoi tsuzuketeru

357
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,570
We always find ourselves crying out

358
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,570
bokura wa itsudemo sakenderu

359
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:11,910
Just continuing to believe is not the answer

360
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:11,910
shinji tsuzukeru dake ga kotae janai

361
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,620
We must bare our weaknesses and wounds,

362
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,620
yowasa mo kizu mo sarake dashite

363
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,300
and continue to struggle,

364
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,300
or nothing will ever turn out!

365
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,300
mogaki tsuzukenakereba hajimaranai

366
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:29,000
Break on through to the other side of the door!

367
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:29,000
tsukiyabure tobira no mukou e

368
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,600
To the other side of the door!

369
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,600
tobira no mukou e

370
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,220
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

371
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,000
The Ishbal Massacre

372
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,950
The Ishbal Massacre

373
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,020
The Ishbal Massacre

374
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,020
Episode 15: "The Ishbal Massacre"

375
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,940
We don't know anything.

376
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:51,150
But you can't use ignorance as an excuse to absolve yourself.
