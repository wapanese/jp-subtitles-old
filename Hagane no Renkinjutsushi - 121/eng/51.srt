1
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,030
The reason I want to spit these creaky old memories out

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,030
kishinda omoi o hakidashitai no wa

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,810
The reason I want to spit these creaky old memories out

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,810
kishinda omoi o hakidashitai no wa

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:22,200
is because I don't have any other proof of my existence

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:22,200
sonzai no shoumei ga hoka ni nai kara

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,550
The future that I thought I had grabbed hold of

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,550
tsukanda hazu no boku no mirai wa

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:33,050
is a contradiction of dignity and freedom

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:33,050
'songen' to 'jiyuu' de mujun shiteru yo

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:43,650
The reason I want to wipe away this distorted afterimage

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:43,650
yuganda zanzou o keshisaritai no wa

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:48,740
is because I see my own limitations within it

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:48,740
jibun no genkai o soko ni miru kara

15
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,040
is because I see my own limitations within it

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,040
jibun no genkai o soko ni miru kara

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,400
In the window of my overly self-conscious self

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,400
jiishikikajou na boku no mado ni wa

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:54,660
is last year's calendar, without any dates written in

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:54,660
kyonen no calendar, hizuke ga nai yo

21
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,710
is last year's calendar, without any dates written in

22
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,710
kyonen no calendar, hizuke ga nai yo

23
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:04,630
I'll erase it and rewrite it

24
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:04,630
keshite rewrite shite

25
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,250
with nonsensical surrealism

26
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,250
kudaranai chougensou

27
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,100
and an unforgettable sense of presence

28
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,100
wasurarenu sonzaikan o

29
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:15,310
Return from the brink of death, and rewrite it

kishikaisei rewrite shite

31
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,010
Even meaningless figments of imagination

32
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,010
imi no nai souzou mo

33
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,210
can be the driving force that gives you form

34
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,210
kimi o nasu gendouryoku

35
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,470
Give your whole body and soul to me

36
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,470
zenshinzenrei o kure yo

37
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,040
Brother?

38
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,330
Ed!

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,390
Humans die all too quickly.

40
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,760
Brother! Brother!

41
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,640
It can't be! There's no way 
Brother can be dead!

42
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,100
Dead?

43
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,820
That's right, dead. 
They'll all be dead.

44
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,190
Only the homunculi will survive.

45
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,140
Brother can't die!

46
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,330
That's not right! Brother... Brother!

47
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,480
This is real life.

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,040
Perhaps he just 
hadn't paid enough.

49
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,930
We always come 
just a little short of the price.

50
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:55,900
Hey, are you all right?!

51
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,950
Colonel Archer!

52
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,790
I need to use that car.

53
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,310
Colonel, where are you going?

54
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,040
The Führer's residence.

55
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,300
Rebels have broken in.

56
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,800
That was a misunderstanding. It was just Lt. Hawkeye there.

57
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,170
Hawkeye?

58
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,890
What is she doing here?!

59
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,690
Please stop!

60
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,990
The Führer ordered us to question her 
at the command center!

61
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,360
What are you guys plotting?!

62
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,940
Colonel! Colonel!

63
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,240
Please calm down, Colonel!

64
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,760
At this level, all you'll do 
is spend my lives.

65
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:06,930
I was a little curious what would happen 
if my whole body were to explode.

66
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,680
Is that how badly you want to become Führer?

67
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,260
I can see right through your petty ambitions.

68
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,680
But you should have 
spent more time on this.

69
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:26,030
After attempting assassination, you won't ever be able to sit in a seat of power again.

70
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,170
I just can't forgive myself for acting like such a fool.

71
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,670
This is the only way I can 
make amends to dead friends.

72
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,790
Then go apologize to them alone.

73
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,380
Give Brig. Gen. Hughes my regards.

74
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,640
Father!

75
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,310
Not to worry. I caught the rebel.

76
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,810
I'm sorry I didn't follow your orders, Father,

77
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,230
but I wanted to pay you back for looking after me.

78
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,600
This is one of the humans 
whom you said were foolish.

79
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,830
Father? What is the matter, Father?

80
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,840
What have you done?!

81
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,080
U-Um... I took this out of the safe.

82
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,050
I didn't want your precious things 
to be lost if there was a fire, Father.

83
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,250
Father...

84
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,740
This is why I call you fools!

85
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,800
King Bradley...

86
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,840
How many times 
do I have to kill you...

87
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,720
before you die?

88
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,270
Stop!

89
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,610
What? What has he done?

90
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,490
Gluttony?

91
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,790
Alchemic decomposition?

92
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,340
How could you?!

93
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,840
I told you, you can't use alchemy!

94
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,760
That much more has been lost!

95
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,590
Stay back!

96
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,590
Do not touch me!

97
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,930
What do you think you're doing?

98
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,140
Brother is not dead yet.

99
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,940
See? He's still so warm.

100
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,240
His soul is still inside the gate.

101
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,450
All I have to do is 
bring it back from there.

102
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,370
The way he did so for me.

103
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,200
Don't! If you do that...

104
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,210
I...

105
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,690
was turned into a Philosopher's Stone because of the sacrifices of many.

106
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:30,300
No, I might have died 
back on that day to begin with.

107
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,930
Al...

108
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,050
Which is why...

109
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,640
Watch out.

110
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,190
Brother...

111
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,840
Colonel! Colonel!

112
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,890
Colonel!

113
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,230
Roy Mustang!

114
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,120
Al?

115
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,510
Wh-What is this?!

116
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,250
Where are we?!

117
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,240
At the gate.

118
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,240
Where does it go through to?

119
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,640
As I remember, it went to a city called London when I passed through it.

120
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,930
That's what Pop called it.

121
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,310
Pop?! You mean Hohenheim of Light?!

122
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,370
Yeah.

123
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,530
Then he's still alive!

124
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,900
You'd better not. 
There's no telling what will happen.

125
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,780
I'm going to go see Hohenheim!

126
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,470
I'm going to kill him!

127
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,680
Take me to where Hohenheim is!

128
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,190
Don't interfere!

129
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,230
I'm going there!

130
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,220
The place where Hohenheim is!

131
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,500
The place where <i>he</i> is!

132
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,530
The place where Dad is!

133
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,710
Al...

134
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,690
Ed... you're alive?

135
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,830
Yeah...

136
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,640
Why am I crying?

137
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,420
Huh?

138
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,170
Al transmuted you—your dead body.

139
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,970
He used the Philosopher's Stone to restore my body and soul?

140
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,720
Then what happened to <i>him</i>?!

141
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,310
Are you telling me that he's gone?

142
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,160
Al! Al! Al!

143
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,810
Al!

144
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,370
How could this happen?

145
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,790
How could I lose the Philosopher's Stone, 
in the state I'm in?

146
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,430
I'll have to get Pride to drive some more foolish humans into a corner.

147
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,640
Gluttony? What are you doing here?

148
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,900
You must be hungry.

149
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,900
Wait! You recognize me, don't you?!

150
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,040
Hurry and get going.

151
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,550
I hate to ask, 
but can you take him too?

152
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,190
What about you, Ed?

153
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:07,140
I'm going to destroy this place

154
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,090
to make sure nobody ever seeks the Philosopher's Stone again.

155
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,870
Right. You can come along 
afterward by yourself, right?

156
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,320
After all, you've now got some fine legs there.

157
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,320
If what Pop said is true,

158
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:32,540
then right now, Al's body and soul 
are inside the gate.

159
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,700
There can be no other 
price for a life.

160
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,170
Even if I offer all of myself, it might not do any good.

161
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,300
But still,

162
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,800
there's no reason for you to 
have to go away. Come back, Al.

163
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,960
<i>How is everyone?</i>

164
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,740
<i>Things are finally starting to calm down here in Central.</i>

<i>and the military handed over their political decision-making authority to the Assembly.</i>

00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,880
I was grossly mistaken

186
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,570
<i>I think that Brigadier General Mustang's return will still be a while off.</i>

187
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,810
Ot smerti lekarstva nyet

188
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,810
There’s no medicine against death

189
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,450
Would you stop 
looking down like that?

190
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,540
Milaya mama! Nyezhnaya!

191
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,540
Dear mother! Affectionate one!

192
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:02,420
The plan was perfect, but I didn't arrive in time, and as a result...

193
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:02,550
Myi tak lyubili tebya

194
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:02,550
We loved you so much

195
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,810
There's no such thing as perfect.

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,360
No vse nashi silyi

197
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,360
But all our efforts

198
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,620
This whole world is imperfect.

199

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,240

00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,550
That's why it's so beautiful.

<i>How has Alphonse-kun been doing since then?</i>

Moy brat, ya vo vsem vinovat

210
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:32,820
My brother, it’s all my fault

211
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:33,660
<i>I know that when he was found, he was still a ten-year-old boy,</i>

212
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:38,440
Milaya mama! Nyezhnaya!

213
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:38,440
Dear mother! Affectionate one!

214
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,480
<i>but I was surprised that he had lost all of his memories</i>

215
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,030
<i>since the day they tried to transmute their mother.</i>

216
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:43,410
Myi tak lyubili tebya

217
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:43,410
We loved you so much

218
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:47,170
<i>Does he still not remember anything that happened?</i>

219
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:48,360
No vse nashi silyi

220
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:48,360
But all our efforts

221
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:52,180
<i>And will Edward-san really never again...</i>

222
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,380
potrachenyi byili zrya

223
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,380

224
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:58,470
Ya sam soblaznilsya

225
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:58,470
I was lured myself

226
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,190
Sensei!

227
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,320
pryekprasnoy nadyezhdoy

228
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,320
with the beautiful hope

229
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:06,050
So Ed is really nowhere to be found, after all?

230
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,190
vernut' nash semeinyiy ochag

231
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,190
to regain our familial hearth

232
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,190
Even if someone does 
give up their life as the price,

233
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:13,570
Ya sam vo vsem vinovat

234
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:13,570
It’s all my own fault

235
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,280
they probably still cannot 
attain a human transmutation.

236
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,560
Maybe the reason why 
Al is in that form

237
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:18,730
No chto zhe nam delat', kak byit'?

238
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:18,730
So what should we do, how should we act?

239
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,020
is because the four years of time 
they spent together

240
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,630
was the price he had to pay.

241
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:24,180
Kak vse ispravit', zabyit'?

242
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:24,180
How shall we correct everything, forget everything?

243
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,760
Al has been reading books on alchemy recently,

244
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,900
Pyitat'sya vernut' nyel'zya

245
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,900
One shouldn’t try to regain

246
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,710
the way he did long ago.

247
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,970
It's almost like he's doing it 
to keep from forgetting about Ed.

248
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:34,200
togo, chto vzyala zyemlya

249
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:34,200
what was taken by the earth

250
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,680
And as for that boy Wrath,

251
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,970
Winry put some Automail on him.

252
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,440
The ones she had prepared for Ed.

253
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,170
Where is he now?

254
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,940
He left.

255
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,250
Is that so?

256
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,240
You want to study again?

257
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,240
Mm-hmm, at your place, Sensei.

258
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,770
Is that okay?

259
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,940
I want to study more

260
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,540
about alchemy and equivalent exchange.

261
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,840
And one day, 
I want to see Brother again.

262
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,130
I don't know what I should do.

263
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,230
But if I learn more alchemy, then someday,

264
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,730
I'll see Brother again.

265
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,170
That's the feeling I get.

266
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,190
Al...

267
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,320
Is that all right?

268
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,790
I just can't help myself 
against those eyes.

269
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,980
Al,

270
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,540
promise me one thing.

271
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,740
I'm going to keep training 
more and more

272
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,630
to become the greatest 
Automail mechanic around.

273
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,140
So promise me that 
you'll come home.

274
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,140
That you'll come home 
in one piece.

275
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:08,650
I'll be okay. I'll study, and I'm sure I'll find Brother and come home.

276
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,360
That's enough for today.

277
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:41,550
Thank you for coming along with us, Dr. Hohenheim.

278
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,750
Are you all really practicing magic?

279
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,680
In mythology, there is 
an island named Thule.

280
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:53,020
Those of us in the Thule Society 
believe it to be the land where God dwells,

281
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,020
and we are searching for 
a path that will lead us to it.

282
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,280
With your continued help, 
we will work towards that end.

283
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,120
I am looking for a path myself,

284
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,750
Professor Haushofer.

285
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,270
Fourteen marks for just one? 
That's positively awful.

286
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:25,510
How long is this inflation 
going to continue?

287
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:43,640
Munich, 1921

288
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,360
What's going on, Edward?

289
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,040
That.

290
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:59,860
Liquid-fuel rockets? Goddard?

291
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,910
He's an American,

292
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,430
but I hear there's another guy in Transylvania doing the same research.

293
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,590
His name's not Dracula, right?

294
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,970
His name is Oberth, 
and apparently, he's still a student.

295
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:11,770
I'm going to go meet him.

296
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,060
What will you do 
once you meet him?

297
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,520
He's thinking of using rockets to go out into space.

298
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,700
Maybe I can get closer to my world 
by going out into space.

299
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,130
There's ether out there, and all.

300
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,990
Haven't you read Einstein?

301
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,410
That guy is pretty iffy.

302
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,410
If you can't use alchemy, you'll use mechanical technology, huh?

303
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:39,900
I should have been able to bind his soul and body together and recreate him.

304
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,020
But the next thing I knew, 
I had come to this world by myself.

305
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,010
Passing through to here 
was the only way

306
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,160
for you to keep from 
losing your mind and body.

307
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,400
You must have done so unconsciously.

308
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,380
But I've once again lost that which 
Al did so much to give me.

309
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,370
We can't say that 
everything is perfect.

310
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,950
The whole world is 
imperfect, after all.

311
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:18,050
I had meant to give my own life as the price for transmuting Al.

312
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,110
And yet, I'm still alive.

313
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:26,360
Maybe I did obtain something 
without paying the price after all.

314
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,830
Or maybe Al is still there.

315
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,520
You two have been 
journeying together.

316
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,220
The people you met 
during that time,

317
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,270
the things you saw, 
your pain, your effort,

318
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,970
everything that you experienced...

319
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,240
That could be the price you paid, couldn't it?

320
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:01,250
<i>I don't know right now what 
I should do to get back to you.</i>

321
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:05,340
<i>But you can bet that 
I'm coming back.</i>

322
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,750
<i>We'll meet again, Al!</i>

323
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,290
<i>Man must pay an equal price in order to obtain anything.</i>

324
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,870
<i>That is the Law of Equivalent Exchange.</i>

325
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:25,500
<i>At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.</i>

326
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,820
<i>But the real world is imperfect,</i>

327
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:34,370
<i>and there was no law that could explain everything.</i>

328
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,870
<i>Same with the Law of Equivalent Exchange.</i>

329
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,580
<i>Even so, we believe...</i>

330
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,590
<i>that man cannot obtain anything 
without paying a price.</i>

331
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,570
<i>The pain that we received</i>

332
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,050
<i>must have been the price 
we paid to obtain something.</i>

333
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,930
<i>And by paying the price of effort,</i>

334
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:58,850
<i>everyone will certainly be able to obtain something.</i>

335
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,980
<i>Equivalent exchange is not the law of the world.</i>

336
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,070
<i>That's the promise Brother 
and I made with each other</i>

337
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:08,810
<i>until the day we meet again.</i>

338
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,280
