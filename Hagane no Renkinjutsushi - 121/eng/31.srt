1
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,840
Still, these Ishbalans are just refugees, right?

2
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:36,250
If Scar is among them, 
then it's a different story.

3
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,850
Even if that's true, 
isn't this a bit much?

4
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,720
Oh? Are you criticizing our superiors, 
Sergeant Fuery?

5
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,430
Wh-What are you talking about?

6
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,780
Our ultimate objective 
is to secure Scar.

7
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,320
It's likely that we won't 
meet with any resistance.

8
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,950
But what if we do?

9
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,370
I mean, we have information that before we were posted there,

10
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,460
the Ishbalan refugees were attacked in Central by thugs who claimed to be the military.

11
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,440
I'm just saying, they may not have too much trust in the military.

12
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,840
Those markings...

13
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,960
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

14
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,490
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

15
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:01,600
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

16
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,980
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

17
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:21,650
Far away, far away, our dreams will never fade

18
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:21,650
tooku tooku omoi hatenaku

19
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,950
If only the two of us could go back to

20
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,950
futari ga mujaki ni waratteta

21
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,800
the days when we laughed so innocently

22
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,800
ano koro ni modoreru nara

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,900
the days when we laughed so innocently

24
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,900
ano koro ni modoreru nara

25
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,730
Just like glassware

26
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,730
konagona ni kudaketa

27
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,330
that has been smashed to pieces,

28
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,330
glass-zaiku no you na

29
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:52,120
we're putting together the fragments of our memories

30
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:52,120
omoide no kakera o atsumeteru

31
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,910
It's the important things that you notice

32
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,910
daiji na mono wa itsudatte

33
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,730
It's the important things that you notice

34
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,730
daiji na mono wa itsudatte

35
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:03,480
once you've lost them

36
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:03,480
nakushite kara kizuku yo

37
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,730
Oh, please, oh, please, stop time for me,

38
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,730
douka douka jikan o tomete

39
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:16,310
and engrave the way you look right now into my heart

40
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:16,310
kimi no omokage o kono mune ni kizandekure

41
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:21,860
And if, and if, I were ever allowed to,

42
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:21,860
moshimo moshimo yurusareru nara

43
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,270
I would be willing to sacrifice everything

44
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,270
subete o gisei ni shitemo ii

45
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:30,920
just to see that smiling face one more time

46
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:30,920
ano egao o mou ichido

47
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,010
Sin

48
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,010
Sin

49
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,490
You...!

50
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,760
Zolf J. Kimbly! 
How are you still alive?!

51
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,580
Kimbly?

52
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,960
The Crimson Alchemist?

53
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,150
A State Alchemist?

54
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,090
You were supposed to have been executed a long time ago

55
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,420
for your multiple violations of orders at Ishbal.

56
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,420
You can come right out and say it.

57
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,780
I indiscriminately made women and children go "boom."

58
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,210
And when my superiors 
tried to stop me, they also went...

59
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,850
"Boom!"

60
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:16,370
I was certain I would be looking forward to an execution.

61
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,980
But for some reason, 
I was kept alive.

62
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,390
Why?

63
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:24,470
Who can say? The gentleman standing there would know, wouldn't he?

64
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,490
<i>How am I supposed to know?</i>

65
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,580
How long are you going to allow this disturbance to persist inside the command center?!

66
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,510
Arrest them! Take them all into custody at once!

67
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,170
Yes, sir!

68
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,130
Sensei...

69
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,260
I told you, it's no use!

70
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,640
Please wait, Sensei!

71
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,880
All right, Al!

72
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,980
Magnificent!

73
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,960
He's a homunculus, all right.

74
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,480
Now, if you'll excuse me.

75
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:00,860
Hold it!

76
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,660
She's magnificent too!

77
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,620
A superb transmutation!

78
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,510
But those who would dare lay a hand on the Führer...

79
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,510
must meet with defeat by 
my own artful transmutations!

80
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,240
I wish you'd give me 
some more credit.

81
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,150
I'm used to seeing muscles, 
ones more handsome than yours.

82
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,060
Brother, if we don't stop those two fast, the whole building will be destroyed!

83
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,600
If they're not careful, 
this town's going to cease to exist!

84
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,240
Brother!

85
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,880
Interesting body you have there, huh?

86
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,550
He caused an explosion 
out of nowhere!

87
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,890
I've heard about this.

88
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,210
It's an alchemy where he transmutes the materials within a body into something similar to explosives,

89
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,900
then quickly contracts them 
to create an enormous explosion.

90
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,360
Why are you interfering with us?!

91
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,750
We want that child too.

92
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,250
Besides, our boss has 
some business with you.

93
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,420
Oh, is that right?

94
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,360
Just a second! Don't tell me you're planning to turn me into a bomb!

95
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,620
You mean I can't?

96
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,600
No, you can't!

97
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,190
Did Fullmetal tell you that that was his arm and leg?

98
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,540
Mm-hmm.

99
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,420
Then you passed through the doorway under your own power?

100
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,690
Doorway? Doorway?!

101
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,500
Whoa, now...

102
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,800
Starting today, 
you're no longer alone.

103
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,630
Here,

104
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,340
eat these.

105
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,360
Come on.

106
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,320
Enjoy them well.

107
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,610
They've got several hundred human lives 
packed inside them, after all.

108
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,410
Human...?

109
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,540
What's the matter? 
You don't like them?

110
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,980
I see. Well, that leaves us with no other choice.

111
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,360
You can just return the arm and leg 
that you took from him.

112
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,850
You can use alchemy, huh?

113
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,810
I get it, it's because of that arm and leg.

114
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:36,020
Listen, we're raised on 
these stones of life.

115
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,740
We aren't human. 
We're homunculi.

116
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,830
The fact that you can eat those...

117
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,900
means that you aren't human either.

118
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,460
Sure enough, we'll have to ask Greed-sama himself to step in!

119
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,410
Greed-sama!

120
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,510
Well, well, maybe I should 
blow the whole building up.

121
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:15,570
I am Lt. Col. Frank Archer. 
Crimson Alchemist.

122
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,570
It's a pleasure.

123
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:23,790
If you're here like this, then it must 
mean that the Führer has agreed to it.

124
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,520
Or was this at Basque Grand's discretion?

125
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,540
Good question.

126
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,130
You have no intention of 
returning to military duty?

127
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,800
I can make it happen.

128
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,680
Sensei! Sensei!

129
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,680
Sensei! Sensei!

130
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,140
That bastard! 
He scratched me good!

131
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,900
Major!

132
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,350
Ah, yow-ow-ow-ow! 
This is bad!

133
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:55,340
I should have expected the master of the 
Elric brothers to be able to take me unawares!

134
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,030
Thank you, Major.

135
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,620
I thought it might 
turn out like this.

136
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,490
Your hand should be 
on the other side.

137
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,350
This boy is no longer...

138
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,840
Go on now.

139
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,120
Do as you like.

140
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,500
Brother, it doesn't look like Sensei is here anymore.

141
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,810
Damn.

142
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,980
Why is she so caught up in that boy, considering the shape her body is in?

143
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,270
You two go around to the south! The rest of you come with me!

144
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,960
Let's go. We're trespassers here.

145
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,810
The Colonel's going to make more snide remarks about me.

146
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,900
What?

147
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,800
Verify that once again.

148
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,060
What is it?

149
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,280
Don't you know whether or not 
the Führer is safe yet?

150
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,080
That's just it. When we contacted Central,

151
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,040
they told us that the Führer was not scheduled to come down south.

152
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,540
Impossible! We saw him with our own...

153
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,810
Have you taken the Elric brothers and that woman into custody?

154
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:37,570
No, I thought it was more urgent 
to secure this crumbling building,

155
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,380
so I have returned.

156
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,560
Major!

157
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,930
No, it's all right.

158
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,090
Those two don't have anywhere else to return to besides the military, after all.

159
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,800
Just in case, have everyone look one more time for the Führer.

160
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,900
Yes, sir.

161
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,690
You know where Sensei is, don't you?!

162
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,830
Please, tell us. We're concerned about her condition.

163
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,840
What's more, that child is a homunculus, and there's no telling what he'll do.

164
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,990
The place where she performed human transmutation...

165
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,430
Izumi-san lost her child there.

166
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,630
She then transmuted his body, to try to bring him back to life.

167
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,320
How do you know that?!

168
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,090
I knew it.

169
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,090
She's gone to the same place this time. That's my hunch.

170
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,470
The place Sensei would choose...

171
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,530
Where she wouldn't do damage to the surrounding area...

172
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,290
Where no one else would go...

173
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,150
Yock Island.

174
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,650
That's it, right?

175
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,600
My son...

176
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,950
What's the matter?

177
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,010
Hurry up and do it.

178
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,820
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

179
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,280
Sensei!

180
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,380
Sensei!

181
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,750
Sensei!

182
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,750
Izumi-san!

183
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,510
Sensei!

184
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,300
Stop that!

185
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,720
Sensei!

186
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,730
You bastard!

187
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,150
Stop!

188
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,570
It's all right.

189
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,730
Sensei...

190
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,080
But that boy was going to kill you, Izumi-san!

191
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,600
I was planning to kill him.

192
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,570
But I'm the one 
who should have died.

193
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,710
Why?!

194
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,590
I'm the one who created him.

195
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:12,890
I added some other materials to my dead baby's remains

196
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,880
and attempted a 
human transmutation.

197
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,930
But what was born...

198
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,600
You know, don't you?

199
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,940
It wasn't... human.

200
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,270
When I came to, I was in front of the gateway once again.

201
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,880
Ed, what did you see on 
the other side of the door?

202
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,630
Everything that is alchemy.

203
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:00,890
It felt as though all the reasoning 
of the world was pouring into me.

204
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,980
The truth was in there.

205
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,210
The truth, huh?

206
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,190
To me, it looked like hell.

207
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,330
I placed the boy there.

208
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,690
But there's no way this boy could be that child.

209
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,960
I recognized him in one glance.

210
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,490
If he had continued to grow, 
he would've been exactly the same age.

211
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,320
Most of all, for a homunculus to appear in this place,

212
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,840
it would have to be the boy 
I left behind then.

213
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,420
He's a homunculus!

214
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,260
A man-made person, 
something that somebody created!

215
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,380
Created?

216
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,880
Do you know how 
homunculi are created?

217
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,330
No, we don't.

218
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:20,760
But it's probably the same way Chimera are created, 
in places like the 5th Laboratory!

219
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,060
N—

220
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,060
No.

221
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:30,390
When worthless humans like you perform human transmutations for the hell of it,

222
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:34,790
what is born as a result 
is a soulless reject,

223
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:38,070
furnished with only 
a body and a mind.

224
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,910
That's what you guys 
call a homunculus!

225
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,080
It couldn't be...

226
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,670
How do you know 
something like that?!

227
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:51,250
I was forced to remember it, by Envy.

228
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,760
Envy? You've met with him?!

229
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,420
That's right.

230
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:59,360
Envy and all the others were born long ago,

231
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,860
thanks to some idiot somewhere performing human transmutation.

232
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,390
That's why we all 
want to become human.

233
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,830
Shall we get going?

234
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,430
Well if isn't the Mightiest Shield.

235
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:32,880
Yo, Mightiest—er, was it "Monster" that you liked to be called?

236
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,130
Even after being locked away for a century, 
it appears you still haven't learned, huh?

237
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,560
Yeah, you'll have to excuse me.

238
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,840
Was that joke too old?

239
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,160
I don't know any 
present-day ones.

240
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,140
What happened to the skull?

241
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,480
I destroyed it, of course.

242
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,620
Is that right? You put it away someplace safe, huh?

243
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,270
Once I find it, I'll lock you away once again without delay.

244
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,110
As if I'd let you!

245
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:08,160
It appears that there really is a new member around here.

246
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,190
He's got nothing to do with you.

247
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,850
No, I would like to 
go on living, after all.

248
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,670
I'm going to need 
friends to do that.

249
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,170
You're late to the party.

250
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,120
Sloth...

251
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,840
Sloth? So, someone with that name 
has been born, huh?

252
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,380
There's a new Lust as well.

253
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,740
That means that for the first time 
in a while, all seven of us are around.

254
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,050
Pleased to meet you, Greed.

255
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,120
It is an honor to make 
your acquaintance.

256
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,400
I may be greedy, 
but I'm not stupid.

257
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,140
I have no intention of 
fighting against two homunculi.

258
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,100
Oh, my.

259
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,260
We'll deal with him later.

260
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,500
Where's Wrath?

261
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,800
Ah, right about now, 
he's with the Fullmetal boy.

262
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,730
You maneuvered him into a 
confrontation with Edward Elric?

263
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,750
You were supposed to use Wrath to lure those two

264
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,280
toward the Philosopher's Stone once again, weren't you?

265
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:27,280
I wanted to see Fullmetal's—that dirty bastard's child's face tense with fear!

266
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,080
Everything—I remember it all!

267
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,470
On the other side of that door, 
the only thing I could do was wait.

268
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,090
Just wait and wait...

269
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:44,680
Meanwhile, my body 
grew bigger, little by little.

270
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,430
And then this one time, 
a fool came by.

271
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,270
That fool came to leave 
his arm and leg at the doorway,

272
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:54,110
shouting for his brother to be returned to him.

273
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:58,250
And so, I took that arm and leg.

274
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,360
And then, after another long while, 
I opened the door.

275
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,040
I had finally come out of there!

276
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,900
It's not true...

277
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,690
Thank you for the arm and leg.

278
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,290
Thank you for the incomplete life.

279
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,990
I'm so thankful that no matter how much I might hate you, it's still not enough.

280
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,010
Now, give me all of your body!

281
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,760
Then I will become human!

282
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,980
That stung. I don't want <i>your</i> body.

283
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,720
Brother, if you're not 
going to fight, then I will!

284
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,780
Al, stop! That boy isn't—

285
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,700
Still...!

286
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:52,300
This boy's right arm and left leg 
belong to Brother!

287
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,120
He lost them for my sake!

288
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,750
Al...

289
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:59,960
The whole reason 
we've been traveling...

290
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,250
is to get them back!

291
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
On the day you left,

292
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
On the day you left,

293
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
kimi ga tabidatsu hi wa

294
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330

295
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,620
I said good-bye and waved, like always

296
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,620
I said good-bye and waved, like always

297
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,620
itsumo to onaji 'jaa ne' to te o futta

298
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,620
itsumo to onaji 'jaa ne' to te o futta

299
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840
Almost as if I would see you again

300
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840
Almost as if I would see you again

301
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840

And until the day my dream comes true,
