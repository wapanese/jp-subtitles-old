00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,630
It was the stone, as red as blood,

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,380
which promised to turn suffering to delight, bring victory to battle,

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,560
and life back to the dead.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,750
In reverence, people referred to it 
as "The Philosopher's Stone."

5
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,990
How can this be possible?

6
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,070
Brother...

7
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:44,730
This is the answer we finally arrive at 
after seeking it for so long?

8
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,760
How can living people be the ingredients for a Philosopher's Stone?

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,940
And so many of them, to boot!

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,060
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

11
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,640
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

12
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,680
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

13
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:12,960
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,100
Ready, steady, can't hold me back

15
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,450
Ready, steady, give me good luck

16
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,750
Ready, steady, never look back

17
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,150
Let's get started, ready, steady, go!

18
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,300

M-Major, p-please, wait a minute!

59
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,940
Major Armstrong!

60
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,440
Um, right now, they appear to be tired, so we probably shouldn't disturb them.

61
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,700
What? They're tired?

62
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,230
In that case, I'll invite them to have dinner, 
which will invigorate them.

63
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,990
Ah, no! Um...

64
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,940
Right now, the two of them are resting.

65
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,280
I will tell them that 
you came by, Major.

66
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,280
I see. I guess there's nothing I can do if they're sleeping.

67
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,740
God must really hate people who have committed taboo.

68
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,190
Just when we think things are 
within reach, they run away from us.

69
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,300
Then it repeats.

70
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,260
And when they're finally within our grasp, we get kicked down by them.

71
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,230
Is this going to happen 
for our whole lives?

72
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,990
Brother...

73
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,980
I thought that once we found the Philosopher's Stone,

74
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,830
our wish would be granted.

75
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:21,030
We'll find it, that's for sure! 
After all, we're trying this hard.

76
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,790
They may say that you're a dog of the military

77
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,250
and that you've sold your soul 
for special privileges,

78
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,740
but haven't we persevered without admitting defeat?

79
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,420
And so...

80
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,250
And so, we'll find it for sure, Brother!

81
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,270
Brother...

82
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,170
Let's try starting from square one again.

83
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,530
I've had enough.

84
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,730
There's a chance that 
we misread something.

85
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,770
I said I've had enough.

86
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,540
But what if we try re-reading it? 
We might discover something new!

87
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,500
I'm going to give it a shot. Let's keep trying!

88
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
I told you, I've had enough!

89
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,720
Brother...

90
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,150
Is something the matter?

91
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,530
I'm sorry. I don't even 
want to look at it anymore.

92
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,450
Brother...

93
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,710
So, that's it, then?

94
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,910
You won't regret 
having given up here?

95
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,980
Is what you've been searching for something you would abandon this easily?

96
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,690
Stop going on when you 
don't even know the half of it.

97
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,640
I know. I know that you guys are seeking the Philosopher's Stone

98
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,270
and that it is made by 
sacrificing living people.

99
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,460
I knew it was rude, 
but I allowed myself to listen in.

100
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,130
If you've listened in, 
then you must know

101
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,550
that it won't do any good to investigate any further. Just leave us alone!

102
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,300
You really are a child, huh?

103
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,390
You're scared, right? 
That the answers might disappear?

104
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,380
You don't want to acknowledge that everything you've gone through this far

105
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,520
might be in vain, right?

106
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,000
Am I wrong?

107
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,790
Isn't it okay if it doesn't 
mean anything?

108
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:27,300
Verifying whether or not this means anything is worth something, if you ask me.

109
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,800
What you're seeking isn't 
anything all that simple, right?

110
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,180
Why don't you keep trying 
a little longer, Edward-san?

111
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,690
You're right...

112
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,950
It's not as though the answers are going to change

113
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,700
just because I chuck it 
all along the way.

114
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,700
Brother!

115
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,070
We've come this far! 
How can we end it all halfway?!

116
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,710
We're going to 
see it to the end!

117
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,680
Let's do it, Al!

118
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,430
Mm-hmm!

119
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,740
Marcoh-san's research is sound in theory.

120
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,370
However, it still didn't result in a perfect Philosopher's Stone.

121
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,430
There still might be other possibilities.

122
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:23,830
Yeah. I'm going to verify the truth of Marcoh-san's theory with my own eyes.

123
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,940
Truth?

124
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,450
The genuine truth behind truths...

125
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,090
Behind... truths...

126
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,950
That's it! There's something else!

127
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,920
According to this data,

128
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,960
a considerably large facility would be needed to create a Philosopher's Stone.

129
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,720
There are currently four alchemy laboratories under the military.

130
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:59,220
Among those, Doctor Marcoh was assigned to the 3rd Laboratory.

131
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,630
I went around to all of the laboratories in the city,

132
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,900
and there wasn't any research 
all that remarkable going on there.

133
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,810
Huh? What's this?

134
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,740
Ah, in the past, 
that was the 5th laboratory,

135
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,820
but it was closed down, 
and is deserted now.

136
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,510
There's a risk of it collapsing, so it was made off-limits.

137
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,820
It's there!

138
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,830
Look.

139
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,410
There's a prison next to it.

140
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,120
Central 2nd Prison.

141
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,660
What about it?

142
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,540
With people being the ingredient for a Philosopher's Stone,

143
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,420
what if they did their research there because it was the easiest place to procure them?

144
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,180
You don't mean, they used prisoners?

145
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,180
Yeah.

146
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,200
If they didn't execute 
condemned criminals

147
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,590
and instead used them as live materials, that would explain it.

148
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,890
Who's in charge of 
the laboratories?

149
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,910
That would have been 
Brig. Gen. Basque Grand.

150
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,530
And he was killed by Scar 
some time ago.

151
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,530
Brother...

152
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,810
We've got no choice.

153
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,230
How about we check things out directly?

154
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:01,790
Mm-hmm.

155
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,240
J-Just a moment!

156
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,160
From here on, 
this is grown-ups' work.

157
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,750
Besides, Scar is still after you.

158
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,050
It's too dangerous for you 
to go walking around outside.

159
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,750
Yeah, but still...

160
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,720
We will investigate the 5th Laboratory. You wait here, please.

161
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,010
If we learn anything, 
we will report it to you.

162
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,430
If you please...

163
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,520
Brother...

164
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,980
So be it. Okay, it's up to you.

165
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,950
We'll ask you to handle it.

166
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,980
Right! Leave it to us!

167
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,790
Lt. Colonel Hughes,

168
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:18,860
I'm finished writing down the 
court record for case number 3263.

169
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,680
Oh, is that right? 
Sorry, hang on a minute.

170
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:27,240
Well, let's have you continue on with case number 9572, if you would.

171
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,160
They're going to use it in a trial tomorrow, so put a rush on it.

172
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,420
Okay...

173
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,280
What's the matter?! Are you tired?!

174
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,750
No, not particularly!

175
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,600
Look here! This one is 
a special swimsuit version!

176
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,740
What do you think? 
She's so cute, it just melts your heart!

177
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,080
Just looking at this, the fatigue just flies away, doesn't it?

178
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,480
How about it? Hm? Hm?

179
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,380
Yes...

180
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,130
It does, doesn't it?

181
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,480
Um, Lt. Colonel...

182
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:58,740
My daughter is such a little healer.

183
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,740
Lt. Colonel! What is the problem there?!

184
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,450
So, did you find Scar's body?

185
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,950
Not yet, huh?

186
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,910
All right. As for the matter of us sending security to the library,

187
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,420
hurry and take care of that for me.

188
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,860
Oh, I've been introduced to quite a find here.

189
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,590
I owe one to Ed for her.

190
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,550
Tripwire alarms?

191
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,440
For a building that isn't being used, the security sure is tight, huh?

192
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,820
This is getting more 
and more suspicious.

193
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,870
All right, let's go around back.

194
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,290
Al...

195
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,380
Ups-a-daisy!

196
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,650
I hate to say it, 
but it's times like this

197
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,770
that I'm glad I don't have my flesh-and-blood arm and leg.

198
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,500
Same here.

199
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,130
This entrance is locked up tight, too, huh?

200
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,060
Brother, over there...

201
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,370
Looks like it goes 
all the way inside.

202
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,910
Al, you wait here.

203
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,580
Will you be all right 
by yourself?

204
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,080
All right or not, your huge size won't fit through here, right?

205
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,350
Okay, I'll be back in a bit.

206
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,090
I'm not this big 
because I wanted to be!

207
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,960
This is Lt. Maria Ross.

208
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,090
Major Armstrong, please.

209
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,360
What is it, Lieutenant?

210
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,830
Major, I need to talk to you 
about something.

211
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,150
Hey!

212
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,340
Contact the Command Center at once, 
and call in reinforcements!

213
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,110
Yes, sir!

214
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,710
I have no business with you.

215
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,290
Where is Fullmetal?!

216
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,450
Two of you stay here! 
We're going up another stairway!

217
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,420
He's going up to Edward-san's room!

218
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,730
So Fullmetal knew about this too?

219
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,600
Don't move, Scar!

220
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,520
Lieutenant!

221
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,950
Where are Edward-san 
and his brother?

222
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,210
Please look at this.

223
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,680
Those boys...

224
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,010
The town of Liore...

225
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,120
has been dealt with 
all neat and tidy.

226
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,220
There's no longer anyone there who knows too much.

227
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,850
You don't say. Nice work, Envy.

228
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,520
Things are going well here too.

229
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,340
The Fullmetal pipsqueak has caught wind of the laboratory, hasn't he?

230
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,740
Shouldn't we dispose of him 
before it gets out to the military?

231
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,820
If we're going to kill him, 
let me do it!

232
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,700
Hold on. That boy might just grant us what we want.

233
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,440
If we're going to kill him, it won't be too late to do so after that, will it?

234
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,760
Well, it's fine with me as long as it doesn't throw a wrench in the works.

235
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,920
Although, it seems doubtful that 
he would ever arrive there safely.

236
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:36,300
I told them not to lay a hand on those two, but it is concerning.

237
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,260
They <i>are</i> idiots, after all.

238
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,100
If it looks to be too troublesome, dispose of the whole lot of them.

239
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,530
I know.

240
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,270
Damn, this is narrower than I thought.

241
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:51,950
Damn it all, if I were normal-sized, 
I wouldn't have gotten through here.

242
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,430
It's a good thing I'm so little.

243
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,280
Augh! No, it's not!

244
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,290
The lights are on...

245
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,300
So they're not currently using it, huh?

246
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,300
Bingo!

247
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,740
Wh-What the?!

248
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:47,790
For them to go this far, they must really not want anyone getting close.

249
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,380
Sounds interesting! 
I'll take them on!

250
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,410
Hey! Aren't we under orders not to lay a hand on them?

251
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:32,420
I don't care about that. 
I can't rest until I've carved them up!

252
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,920
Wait! There are two in our quarry. There are also two of us.

253
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,910
I won't allow you to 
have them all to yourself.

254
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:44,180
Dammit! This thing is relentless for being just a ball!

255
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:01,070
I-It really is a good thing 
I'm so small...

256
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,580
Why, you! This is a pain!

257
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,220
Come on in, they're saying?

258
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,610
Nice of you to come.

259
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,300
I welcome you.

260
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,080
You don't look very welcoming.

261
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:57,180
I am he who was entrusted to guard this place.

262
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,060
For the time being, 
you may call me Number 48.

263
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,650
Number 48?

264
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:06,650
It's been so long. I'm delighted to be able to go against someone so capable.

265
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,100
You have run out of luck 
by coming up against me.

266
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,690
Do not think ill of me, kid.

267
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:19,150
And you, don't think ill of me for being the kid who defeated you.

268
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,160
Brother sure is taking long. What could he be doing?

269
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,890
Nice. You move well for your size. 
That's more like it.

270
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:36,880
Who are you?!

271
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,670
I should respond when asked who I am, huh?

272
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:45,680
My name is Number 66. 
Although, that's just what they call me at work.

273
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,630
Number 66?

274
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,430
Yes. I do have my own, proper name as well,

275
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,880
but if you heard it, you'd be 
so surprised you'd wet yourself.

276
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,370
I'll tell you when I finish you off.

277
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,600
You say you guard this place, right?

278
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,900
There's a little something I'd like to ask you.

279
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,760
If you can defeat me, 
I will tell you anything.

280
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,030
Right, then...

281
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,620
Let's see how good you are!

282
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,490
You're fast!

283
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,120
Your false arm is steel up to 
the shoulder, is it? Even so...

284
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,630
my beloved sword will pierce even steel!

285
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,100
You've gotta be kidding!

286
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,800
If I bust it again, 
Winry's gonna kill me, you know!

287
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,510
Let's see...

288
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,940

What?!

292
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,540
You brat!
