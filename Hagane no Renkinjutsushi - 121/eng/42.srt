1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,980
What is this?

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,790
This is weird...

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,980
My body is...

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,900
Why, you!

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,450
Just so you know, 
I only specialize in bomb making.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,080
You'll have to take it up with 
someone else to change him ba—

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,290
It's okay.

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,210
You have time.

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:32,320
I made it so that his composition 
slowly but surely absorbs oxygen.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,810
Enjoy the slow, steady approach of that moment when he explo—

11
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,890
He doesn't mean it, right?

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,940
My body isn't going to...

13
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,690
I can't... move... 
It's hard... to talk...

14
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,450
Do not move.

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,810
Alphonse Elric,

16
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,850
I don't know what has 
happened to your body.

17
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,700
If you carelessly stimulate it—

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,710
You'd best not touch him, scarred man.

19
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,710
Homunculus!

20
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,210
Homunculus?

21
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,310
The only thing your arm is capable of is destruction.

22
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,610
Edward would be able to transmute the boy into another material

23
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,310
and should be able to 
prevent him from exploding.

24
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,370
Transmute him...

25
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,950
into another material?

26
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,940
Let's go.

27
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,800
I thought that your objective was to create a Philosopher's Stone.

28
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,660
You really aren't that woman.

29
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,990
There is no way that 
she would say such a thing.

30
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,050
The reason I want to spit these creaky old memories out

31
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,050
kishinda omoi o hakidashitai no wa

32
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:03,830
The reason I want to spit these creaky old memories out

33
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:03,830
kishinda omoi o hakidashitai no wa

34
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:09,220
is because I don't have any other proof of my existence

35
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:09,220
sonzai no shoumei ga hoka ni nai kara

36
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,570
The future that I thought I had grabbed hold of

37
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,570
tsukanda hazu no boku no mirai wa

38
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:20,070
is a contradiction of dignity and freedom

39
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:20,070
'songen' to 'jiyuu' de mujun shiteru yo

40
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,670
The reason I want to wipe away this distorted afterimage

41
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,670
yuganda zanzou o keshisaritai no wa

42
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:35,760
is because I see my own limitations within it

43
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:35,760
jibun no genkai o soko ni miru kara

44
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,060
is because I see my own limitations within it

45
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,060
jibun no genkai o soko ni miru kara

46
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,420
In the window of my overly self-conscious self

47
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,420
jiishikikajou na boku no mado ni wa

48
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:41,680
is last year's calendar, without any dates written in

49
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:41,680
kyonen no calendar, hizuke ga nai yo

50
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,730
is last year's calendar, without any dates written in

51
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,730
kyonen no calendar, hizuke ga nai yo

52
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,650
I'll erase it and rewrite it

53
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,650
keshite rewrite shite

54
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,270
with nonsensical surrealism

55
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,270
kudaranai chougensou

56
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,120
and an unforgettable sense of presence

57
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,120
wasurarenu sonzaikan o

58
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,330
Return from the brink of death, and rewrite it

59
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,330
kishikaisei rewrite shite

60
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,030
Even meaningless figments of imagination

61
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,030
imi no nai souzou mo

62
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,230
can be the driving force that gives you form

63
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,230
kimi o nasu gendouryoku

64
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,490
Give your whole body and soul to me

65
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,490
zenshinzenrei o kure yo

66
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,980
His Name Is Unknown

67
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,980
His Name Is Unknown

68
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,780
Shut up... Stop...

69
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,570
Make that thing shut up.

70
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,580
Get up... and walk!

71
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,700
Move... forward!

72
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,790
Shut up!

73
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,900
Ed!

74
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,760
Rose! Get back!

75
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,300
Let go of me! Let go of me!

76
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,800
Dammit!

77
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,440
I'm not going to allow you to use that arm for any more alchemy!

78
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,610
Shut up!

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,920
Stop that, Edward.

80
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,080
Come over here.

81
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,530
Ed!

82
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,680
Don't!

83
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,450
I've been wondering 
about you for a while now.

84
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,180
You look too much like her.

85
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,520
But I've been trying to keep myself from thinking about it...

86
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,690
Trying not to think about it...

87
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,440
On that day, did we...

88
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,360
create you?

89
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,830
Ed!

90
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,830
If so, then you...

91
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,750
are our sin!

92
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,350
A homunculus...

93
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,350
So you've infiltrated 
the military, have you?

94
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,730
For what purpose?

95
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,480
Don't you lay a hand on her!

96
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,250
Let's go, Rose.

97
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,800
You went too easy on them. 
Homunculi have more than just one life.

98
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,550
It will take more than that to finish them off.

99
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,800
That was amazing, Rose!

100
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,470
Your voice is back.

101
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,580
You're right.

102
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,980
You're right.

103
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,200
Thanks to both you and your 
baby's voices, I was spared...

104
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,700
I can't reach Kimbly.

105
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,170
Nor your Chimeras.

106
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,890
They are on a special mission from the Führer.

107
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,570
Does it really take this long 
just to find Fullmetal's corpse

108
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,420
and bring it back here?

109
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,840
Did he and Scar end up 
killing each other?

110
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,950
Or is he just out having fun 
destroying things?

111
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,580
I can't stand this waiting!

112
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,350
So this is your command center, 
is it, Archer?

113
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,880
You're out of line, Mustang!

114
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,610
Don't move!

115
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,110
Hi.

116
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,950
What was that?

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,200
How mean!

118
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,360
Lieutenant!

119
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,570
Relax.

120
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,580
He's...

121
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,290
Yes, he is.

122
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,320
Shou Tucker,

123
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,460
the Sewing Life Alchemist.

124
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,000
You, huh?

125
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,470
I guess you couldn't go along with my methods, then?

126
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,970
I don't remember ever 
supporting you to begin with.

127
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,550
I just had to dip myself in the sludge in order to get the corruption

128
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,100
that's rampant throughout the military 
to rise to the surface.

129
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,490
There's no such thing as a military that 
doesn't have any corruption or evil within it.

130
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,190
Tucker!

131
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,960
What good does it do you, 
pulling a stupid stunt like this?!

132
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,970
As you were recognized 
once upon a time in Ishbal,

133
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,610
today, I will be the hero.

134
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,480
Hey, hey!

135
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,440
They're gonna die. They're gonna die.

136
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,900
They're all gonna die, huh?

137
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,740
I guess the depth of 
that person's thoughts

138
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,990
is lost on the likes of humans.

139
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,580
No matter.

140
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,510
As long as they get rid of Scar.

141
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:50,200
Then again, if they are to become ingredients for the Philosopher's Stone...

142
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,090
The Philosopher's Stone? They're gonna make it?

143
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,070
There's no way it will 
fall into the hands of men.

144
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,560
In other words, 
it won't even exist.

145
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,810
I'm sorry, but I can't 
remember anything.

146
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,800
I wasn't expecting you to.

147
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,320
You are not the woman my brother was trying to bring back to life.

148
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,490
You just look like her, that's all.

149
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,400
Once I become human with the 
Philosopher's Stone, it will be the same thing.

150
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,520
No, it won't.

151
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,920
What will be different about it?

152
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,050
That which is dead 
does not come back to life.

153
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,330
What are you planning to do?

154
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,260
Just a minute!

155
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,270
Stay back!

156
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,520
Just be quiet and watch.

157
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,350
What have you done?

158
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,130
I inherited this arm 
from my brother.

159
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,000
My brother turned himself into a transmutation circle

160
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,760
and sealed up the lives of the 
Ishbalan people within himself.

161
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,490
In order to transmute the 
Philosopher's Stone inside himself.

162
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,060
And then it was taken on by you.

163
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,210
Then...

164
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,960
Do not go near him.

165
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:57,970
There is nothing 
you can do now but watch.

166
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,710
Are you out of your mind?

167
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:02,140
You intend to turn this boy 
into the Philosopher's Stone?!

168
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,520
There isn't any time.

169
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,600
Unless I change his whole body into 
some other material, he will explode.

170
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,590
So you're making him 
the Philosopher's Stone?

171
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,940
Are you sure you want to hand 
a Philosopher's Stone over to them?

172
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,100
I don't even know 
if I will succeed.

173
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,080
If it is to be, then it will be theirs.

174
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,560
They may do as they wish with it.

175
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,740
I can't have that.

176
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,470
I need you to create a genuine Philosopher's Stone.

177
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:40,770
Don't do anything so absurd 
as to transmute that boy's body.

178
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:45,140
If you kill me here and now, will your wish be fulfilled?

179
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,700
Fine, then.

180
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,780
If he does create the genuine article, I'll just use it right there and then.

181
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:09,430
It's no concern of mine what happens to the younger brother, after all.

182
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:16,960
Brother... stop... Scar-san...

183
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,550
At this rate, you'll be able to reach a town farther away.

184
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,010
You're going now?

185
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,790
You'll have to manage somehow.

186
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,720
I'm going to go catch Scar.

187
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,560
It's Scar that the military is after.

188
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,060
You're going to turn Scar over to the military?

189
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,270
That's probably the only way the military will let the people of Liore off the hook.

190
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,730
No, Ed, you can't...

191
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,100
You know why, don't you?

192
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,780
Equivalent... exchange.

193
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,850
Maybe there's something I can do.

194
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,210
I don't know. 
Maybe if I tell the Colonel

195
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,390
about the Führer's secretary from earlier, and then...

196
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,440
whatever, make some 
kind of deal with him.

197
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,640
Still, don't count on it, okay?

198
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,830
In any case, get out of here.

199
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,700
As far as you can get, 
before the military realizes.

200
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,400
Right. That was the plan 
from the start.

201
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,390
We'll split up into small groups

202
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,280
and slip our way into 
other cities someplace.

203
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,430
I'm counting on you, Lyra.

204
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:27,990
Rose.

205
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,030
See you later, Ed.

206
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,320
Yeah.

207
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,040
No,

208
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,930
this is good-bye, Rose.

209
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,010
There's no sign of anyone!

210
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,270
Could they be planning a sneak attack?

211
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,270
What's that?

212
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,160
There's someone there!

213
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,270
Colonel!

214
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,270
What's that?

215
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,800
Is that...

216
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,720
That's a State Alchemist!

217
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,470
It's Scar! Scar is there!

218
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:14,500
That bastard! He murdered the 
State Alchemist who went in to talk to him!

219
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,440
Have the tank division 
surround the city!

220
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,080
Infantrymen, capture Scar! Forward!

221
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,010
The military was not 
supposed to move in.

222
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,320
In that case, 
it must be the will of God.

223
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,910
There he is!

224
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,820
You fool.

225
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,140
I can't die that easily.

226
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,740
I knew that...

227
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,190
but my body moved on its own...

228
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,900
You were in love... with me?

229
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,400
Not with you...

230
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,620
I hated my brother.

231
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:44,680
He turned his back on the teachings of Ishbala and studied alchemy.

232
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:50,610
Despite knowing that he gave me his arm so that I would survive,

233
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,330
I still couldn't help but hate him.

234
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,800
The Elric brothers... 
each live for the other.

235
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,750
Yes.

236
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:08,630
The older loves the younger, 
and the younger loves the older.

237
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,640
I also wanted to tell...

238
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,490
my older brother...

239
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,650
that I loved him.

240
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,920
Which is why you're doing for that younger brother

241
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,990
what your older brother 
did for you, right?

242
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,840
Now, get going.

243
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,750
The despicable act 
is about to begin.

244
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,730
I don't even know 
your real name...

245
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,870
Our names are something 
that are given to us by God.

246
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,130
However, as someone who 
has turned his back on God,

247
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,880
I no longer have a name.

248
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,410
There he is! It's Scar!

249
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,920
After him!

250
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,920
Yes, sir!

251
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,540
Farewell, Scar.

252
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,090
Stop!

253
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,090
Stop!

254
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,340
You're safe?

255
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:18,680
The citizens of Liore surrender! Scar is the only one left!

256
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,100
Surrender? I don't believe it.

257
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,220
They killed the Crimson Alchemist.

258
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,100
Is that what your just cause is?!

259
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,610
The war has begun.

260
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,710
You can go ahead and die yourself if you want,

261
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,980
but don't send those clueless soldiers in there in the name of your worthless lust for glor—

262
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,750
We've spotted someone who appears to be Scar!

263
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,850
We are engaging him now!

264
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:37,860
All right!

265
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,080
Stop!

266
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,870
Hey, wait! Stop!

267
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,700
Brother...

268
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:53,550
"Those who give pain cannot sleep."

269
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,530
However, I need not worry about that any longer.

270
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:01,720
I shall never seek sleep again.

271
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,970
Brother...

272
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,440
Wh-What is that?

273
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,060
What is that?!

274
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,450
Colonel!

275
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,710
You stupid bastards!

276
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,830
Are you all right?

277
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,320
More or less.

278
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,920
Did Colonel Archer 
take the division?

279
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,110
Y-Yes... and there's something strange about that...

280
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,010
The town of Liore 
lit up a deep red.

281
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,930
And we can't contact the division.

282
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,860
What was that? 
What just happened here?

283
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,840
Hurry and carry away 
those who are still alive.

284
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,350
Scar!

285
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,720
Al...

286
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,000
Brother?

287
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,570
Brother, no! Stay back! I'm going to explode!

288
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,510
Huh?

289
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:15,890
Al...

290
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,610
What are you doing here?

291
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,370
Huh?

292
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,220
I'm back to normal?

293
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,700
Brother, I'm back! 
My body is back to normal!

294
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,290
Huh? I don't know 
what's going on here.

295
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,580
Oh, right.

296
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,600
I was turned into 
a bomb by Kimbly.

297
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,510
But Scar-san said that if my armor 
were transmuted into something else,

298
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,300
I would be spared, so he...

299
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,050
Al, open up your belly.

300
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,030
Just open it!

301
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,520
Brother, what is this?

302
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,620
Al...

303
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,530
Moments ago, a transmutation circle 
was activated in the city.

304
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,740
Scar has transmuted 
a Philosopher's Stone.

305
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,540
Not inside himself...

306
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,460
Yes, that's right, boy.

307
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,870
Little Brother,

308
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,460
you have been transmuted 
into the Philosopher's Stone.

309
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,120
I'm... the Philosopher's Stone?

310
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,090
What's going on here?!

311
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,190
Why would he do such a thing?!

312
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,620
Go on.

313
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:34,210
Soon, they will be after you, and then everything will be set in motion.

314
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,730
Didn't you want the 
Philosopher's Stone as well?

315
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,570
Brother...

316
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,920
I'm...

317
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,050
Al...

318
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,220
As my tears well up,

319
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,220

It's true, I cannot see you now,

I'm sorry, Colonel.

360
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:51,010
But we will come back.
