1
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,990
I am near my limit, it's true.

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,480
But the same thing 
goes for you too.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,050
Even if you can hide your 
decaying body with clothing,

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,200
you cannot disguise the smell.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,910
Hohenheim...

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,370
You're right.

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,430
This is the first time in hundreds of years 
that we've seen each other.

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,110
We should have a nice long talk with each other.

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,210
Besides, I haven't even 
tried out this young body.

10
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,910
Sorry, but I have a wife.

11
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,590
Yes, and I have had husbands.

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,200
Many, many, many of them.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,200
If I hadn't, then the secret of my slowly aging body would have become known.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,820
For me, Trisha was my first and my last—
the first woman I ever loved.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,530
Oh, my. Four hundred years ago,

16
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,570
when we first met, 
and I didn't know any better,

17
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,160
you whispered words of love to me.

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,080
Or perhaps I'm remembering wrong.

19
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,290
Let's stop this.

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,940
On that day, four hundred years ago, 
we finally made it.

21
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,710
There were those who had escaped the witch hunts

22
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,550
and those who were just waiting for death from the black plague.

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,960
Over and over, we used their lives 
in our experiments

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,220
and obtained a Philosopher's Stone.

25
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,210
But the reaction from that transmutation left you nearly dead,

26
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:01,800
so using the Philosopher's Stone, I bonded your soul to the body of another person.

27
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,810
And so, we had obtained eternal life.

28
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,320
You mean, you've used 
the Philosopher's Stone

29
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,820
to transfer your souls around 
over and over again?

30
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,480
Yes, we have.

31
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,450
You don't mean... 
the whole reason why

32
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,090
you had us seek out someone who could make a Philosopher's Stone was...

33
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,710
I found that it became necessary, once Hohenheim of Light left me.

34
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,720
Why? Why did you 
disappear from my sight?

35
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:41,930
Dante,

36
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,320
there is no such thing 
as eternal life.

37
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,640
The Philosopher's Stone.

38
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:55,810
Those who obtain it are set free from the Law of Equivalent Exchange.

39
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,610
There is no need to pay a price 
in order to obtain something, either.

40
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,460
We sought it and found it.

41
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,000
The reason I want to spit these creaky old memories out

42
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,000
kishinda omoi o hakidashitai no wa

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,780
The reason I want to spit these creaky old memories out

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,780
kishinda omoi o hakidashitai no wa

45
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:28,170
is because I don't have any other proof of my existence

46
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:28,170
sonzai no shoumei ga hoka ni nai kara

47
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:33,520
The future that I thought I had grabbed hold of

48
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:33,520
tsukanda hazu no boku no mirai wa

49
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:39,020
is a contradiction of dignity and freedom

50
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:39,020
'songen' to 'jiyuu' de mujun shiteru yo

51
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:49,620
The reason I want to wipe away this distorted afterimage

52
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:49,620
yuganda zanzou o keshisaritai no wa

53
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,710
is because I see my own limitations within it

54
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,710
jibun no genkai o soko ni miru kara

55
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,010
is because I see my own limitations within it

56
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,010
jibun no genkai o soko ni miru kara

57
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:00,370
In the window of my overly self-conscious self

58
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:00,370
jiishikikajou na boku no mado ni wa

59
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:00,630
is last year's calendar, without any dates written in

60
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:00,630
kyonen no calendar, hizuke ga nai yo

61
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:05,680
is last year's calendar, without any dates written in

62
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:05,680
kyonen no calendar, hizuke ga nai yo

63
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,600
I'll erase it and rewrite it

64
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,600
keshite rewrite shite

65
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,220
with nonsensical surrealism

66
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,220
kudaranai chougensou

67
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,070
and an unforgettable sense of presence

68
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,070
wasurarenu sonzaikan o

69
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:21,280
Return from the brink of death, and rewrite it

70
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:21,280
kishikaisei rewrite shite

71
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,980
Even meaningless figments of imagination

72
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,980
imi no nai souzou mo

73
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,180
can be the driving force that gives you form

74
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,180
kimi o nasu gendouryoku

75
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:31,440
Give your whole body and soul to me

76
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:31,440
zenshinzenrei o kure yo

77
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,010
Things That Degrade the Heart

78
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,010
Things That Degrade the Heart

79
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,810
Aah! You can't put that much salt in, and you've got too much cream!

80
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,700
Cooking is a science, 
just like making Automail.

81
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,950
You have to make things exact and according to calculations.

82
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,450
And with this newly made oven of mine, 
it will turn out perfectly!

83
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,200
With this knob, you can adjust it to whatever temperature you want in a snap.

84
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,700
It has a timer function you can set for the right number of minutes.

85
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,300
It has this heat-resistant glass, so you can see what's happening inside at any time.

86
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,470
It's absolutely perfect!

87
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,460
Cooking is an art.

88
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,040
It's like literature.

89
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,420
It takes imagination and a sense of adventure that cannot be pigeonholed.

90
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,760
Cooking is a science!

91
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,890
No, it's not. It's an art!

92
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,280
You get it.

93
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,490
I'm a guest, so you go ahead.

94
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,390
No, no, we're like family now—

95
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,900
Hurry and answer that!

96
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,900
Right!

97
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,480
Hello? The Elric brothers are there, right?

98
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,330
Shaw-chan?

99
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,830
Yes. Their voice was strange for some reason,

100
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,170
but they said their name 
was Shaw-chan.

101
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,840
Shaw-chan...

102
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,340
Anyhow, they said to tell you 
they'd like to see you.

103
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,110
Whenever you came back here would be fine, they said.

104
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,850
And another thing—they were crying.

105
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,250
Shaw...

106
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,310
Someone you know?

107
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:24,400
Mm-mm! Wow, that looks delicious! Brother is going to be thrilled!

108
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,820
Ah, it's Brother!

109
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,740
Brother!

110
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,120
What happened to 
your clothes? Brother?

111
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,370
Oh, just went on a little outing.

112
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,040
I made it look like we were setting out to head north.

113
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,200
I deliberately left some eyewitnesses, and on the way back, I fell down.

114
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,050
Then I should have gone with you.

115
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,850
And what if you really <i>were</i> 
discovered by the homunculi?

116
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,660
So, did anything happen?

117
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,690
We seem to have gotten a strange phone call a little while ago.

118
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,690
It's nobody we know! It was probably 
the police trying to find us, you know?

119
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,300
You don't say.

120
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,400
I'm hungry!

121
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,700
I'm the one who recommended 
Edward Elric to be a State Alchemist!

122
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,800
What shame he has brought to me!

123
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,630
Are we certain that the boy was 
connected with the uprising in Liore?

124
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:34,400
According to the report, a year ago in Liore,

125
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,310
he exposed a priest of Leto 
who had been misusing alchemy.

126
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,550
However, the truth of the matter is, 
the priest continued to thrive following that,

127
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:47,780
and consequently, a situation arose 
where we had to intervene militarily.

128
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,240
That intervention was overzealously enforced, and the civilians turned against the military.

129
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,850
Are you criticizing my mission strategy?

130
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,790
Now, hold on, everyone.

131
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,280
Looking at Colonel Mustang's 
service record,

132
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,610
it is clear that he is an excellent soldier who has sworn his loyalty to the military.

133
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,670
However,

134
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:14,050
I do not understand why you would put 
a halt to the search for the Elric brothers.

135
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,910
We thought the Elric brothers would return to their home,

136
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,050
so we put out a 
dragnet in the east.

137
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,310
However, they appear to have gone straight north.

138
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,700
North? To Drachma?

139
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,530
So that's it! They're in contact with those savages, are they?!

140
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,990
Major Armstrong's squad has begun a search in the north.

141
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,170
However, I have learned of 
an even more serious matter,

142
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,620
which is why I have returned.

143
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,700
A serious matter?

144
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,340
If you like, I could have everyone step outside.

145
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,590
No, this is about your secretary, Captain Juliet Douglas.

146
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,470
Well, this is sudden.

147
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,970
She is on leave right now. 
What about her?

148
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,480
I have serious doubts 
about her military service.

149
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,780
What's more, there is a possibility that she was involved in the circumstances

150
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,190
surrounding the murder of Brigadier General Hughes.

151
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,150
Oh, are you certain of that?

152
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,850
You have a crush on her, all right!

153
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,530
Come to think of it, we all heard.

154
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,960
You've gone and done 
something bold again, huh?

155
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,150
Why would you deliberately 
do something to provoke him?

156
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,540
It doesn't matter whether or not 
the Führer is a homunculus.

157
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,700
Still, those who call themselves homunculi

158
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,650
have spent a long time sacrificing human lives 
to create a Philosopher's Stone.

159
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:25,100
If that's the case, then there is a possibility that the civil war in Ishbal

160
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,830
was engineered in order to 
bring about a Philosopher's Stone.

161
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,400
They would intentionally start a war?

162
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:34,110
Why is it that people seek the Philosopher's Stone?

163
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,540
Riches... glory... domination...

164
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,320
Eternal life...

165
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,700
Desperation.

166
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,440
When a person loses 
those who are around them

167
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,060
and is caught up in despair,

168
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,210
they seek the Philosopher's Stone 
as their only hope.

169
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,430
In the middle of the 
irregular conditions of war,

170
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:01,280
the morals that say that one must not sacrifice the lives of others vanish.

171
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,670
It is true that ever since 
the current Führer took power,

172
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,440
the country has been at war 
somewhere or other.

173
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,150
And we've won every one of them.

174
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,640
I don't have any complaints over going to war.

175
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,560
We are soldiers.

176
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,740
But when it's about making people stand at the brink of despair

177
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,570
in order to get a 
Philosopher's Stone created...

178
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,870
Ed! Al! How long are you 
going to sleep in?!

179
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,100
Sorry!

180
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,550
It's all right.

181
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,700
A simple chemical reaction like this 
is one of the fundamentals of alchemy.

182
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,350
There.

183
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,020
Wh-What is that?

184
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,740
It's me, Winry!

185
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,740
Al?

186
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,790
I encased Al snugly inside bronze.

187
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,570
There aren't any seams, so as long as 
they don't break it in half,

188
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,700
there's no way 
they'll know it's him.

189
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,320
You're leaving again?

190
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,960
There's something 
that we have to do.

191
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,160
I know! You're going to 
return Al to normal, right?

192
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,640
You can hide here and do your research, can't you?

193
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,850
Are you going to take revenge for Hughes-san?

194
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,470
No, we won't take revenge.

195
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,560
Otherwise, Scar's death 
will have been meaningless.

196
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,430
Then...

197
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,070
Even so,

198
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,760
there's still something 
that we must do.

199
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,910
Something more important than revenge, and what you've been searching for?

200
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,720
Yow-ow-ow-ow! 
Wh-What are you doing?!

201
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,250
I'm doing your braid for you.

202
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,040
Th-That's okay, I'll do it later.

203
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,250
I'll do it for you!

204
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,250
O-Okay...

205
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,190
It's not anything dangerous, right?

206
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,790
Brother, where could Dad have gone?

207
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,410
Just keep quiet.

208
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,730
Deterioration of the soul?

209
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:30,840
As our souls have been repeatedly transferred into different bodies, they have eroded.

210
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,560
Our souls no longer have the power to sustain their bodies.

211
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,120
Dante, we are going to perish like this.

212
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,400
No, I just need the Philosopher's Stone.

213
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,880
I can always take a new body.

214
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,710
It will happen again immediately after moving to that body,

215
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,390
and the same will be true of the next body.

216
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,390
Then I'll move into 
another new body!

217
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,980
What about the Philosopher's Stone?

218
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:59,570
You must have used the last bit I left you 
to transfer into that body.

219
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:05,170
That is why those boys have made the next Stone for me.

220
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:09,990
The Ishbalan man has turned your son 
into a Philosopher's Stone.

221
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,180
Dante-sama, then it really is true?

222
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,000
Don't you get it yet?

223
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,040
When I saw Edward and Alphonse, I should have realized...

224
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,170
what they had done.

225
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,210
No, I knew.

226
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,390
But I didn't want to believe it.

227
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,890
Trisha...

228
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,470
You will always be dear to me.

229
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,070
Thank you, Hohenheim of Light.

230
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,500
To think that you could be beaten by a homunculus, of all things.

231
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,670
Ever since you left, I've been 
doing some research of my own.

232
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,580
That gate, which is the source of power for alchemy—

233
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,230
What lies on the other side of it?

234
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,210
Isn't there a way 
to open the gate?

235
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,300
The gate is inside of us.

236
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,280
And so, someone whose bond between body, mind, and soul is still weak,

237
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,810
say, as is the case for this baby,

238
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,730
is able to call forth the gate 
even stronger.

239
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,560
Shall we perform an experiment,

240
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,320
to see what the other side of the gate is like?

241
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,420
Tri...

242
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,370
I'm sure that Ed and Al are all right.

243
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,890
They are... your children.

244
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,250
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

245
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,560
It's okay, Wrath.

246
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,820
You don't ever have to go back to the other side of that gate.

247
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,500
Bring the Philosopher's Stone here, 
Wrath, Sloth, and Lust.

248
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,470
So that you...

249
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,430
can be reborn once again?

250
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:21,180
Once I have the Philosopher's Stone, and after my soul has been bonded,

251
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,430
I really will turn 
you all into humans.

252
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,940
However,

253
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,530
it all depends on my mood.

254
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,010
Here is your baby.

255
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,330
You have to eat more,

256
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,290
or you won't be able to fit into my dress sizes, you know.

257
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,390
Search carefully!

258
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,080
There's a possibility that they've changed their hair and eye color.

259
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,660
A large man and a runt.

260
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,120
The runt is as small as a bean sprout, so don't overlook him.

261
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:10,770
He's not the one, huh? The one we're searching for is as small as a baby ant.

262
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,500
Commander!

263
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,940
We found an odd bronze sculpture.

264
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,200
How big is it?

265
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,690
It looks larger than the suit of armor in the dispatch.

266
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,780
Hmm, just to be safe, 
we'll smash it with a hammer!

267
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,540
Break it.

268
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,750
Here goes!

269
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,010
You! You're that man from before!

270
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,370
You're the bean sprout we heard about!

271
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,030
Al, let's go!

272
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,720
Wait, Brother!

273
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,270
A-After them!

274
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,480
Al, go on ahead!

275
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,610
Brother, I can very well...

276
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,190
Just get going!

277
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:10,050
Thanks, Brother. But...

278
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,780
Al, don't use any alchemy.

279
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,420
Why not? I remembered the gate.

280
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,500
And besides, I'm a Philosopher's Stone.

281
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,580
I can probably do it, 
just like you do, Brother.

282
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,880
You don't have to!

283
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:26,420
We don't know what will happen if you use alchemy.

284
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:30,080
We'll take our time to research it, 
and I'll return you to your original body.

285
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,170
We'll take everything from there.

286
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,810
Brother, where are you going?

287
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,720
It's like that bastard said, right?

288
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,020
There's someone pulling 
the strings of the homunculi.

289
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,370
There's something I'm going to need 
in order to find them.

290
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,620
I'm going too.

291
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,700
You can stay. 
I'll be right back.

292
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,000
Brother...

293
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You can look after things here by yourself, right?

294
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:13,400
The two of us have been ordered to take command of the expeditionary forces in the north, huh?

295
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,270
Then it's settled.

296
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,270
Yeah. They have to know we've been in contact with Ed and Al,

297
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,770
because of the matter 
with the secretary.

298
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:25,280
And yet, they're sending us off to the front, 
without the least bit of censure.

299
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,920
If they were going to shut us up, 
they could just attack us here in Central.

300
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,790
There <i>is</i> the matter of Hughes, and all.

301
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,960
If they were to use the same tactic again, 
it would arouse suspicion.

302
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,290
On the battlefield, they can kill us 
whenever they please.

303
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,380
Afterwards, even if they do turn up 
any documents, they can just sit on them.

304
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,810
Still, even now, I can't 
believe that he could be...

305
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,430
No matter how many times I read over the materials that Scieszka gave me,

306
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,560
I couldn't unravel it.

307
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,900
This was the final 
part of the puzzle.

308
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,570
You've given yourself away, haven't you, 
you miserable homunculus?

309
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,390
I didn't think you 
would have stayed here.

310
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,400
You never know what's going on 
right under your nose.

311
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,900
Besides, I wanted to look through 
some of the things that Dante had.

312
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,410
Did you find anything?

313
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,000
I'll tell you later.

314
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,420
More importantly, 
what are you here for?

315
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,420
I think it will just 
get you mad at me again.

316
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,090
Never mind that, tell me.

317
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:28,090
There's something that I absolutely have to get my hands on.

318
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:34,640
Sensei, is there any part of your 
dead baby's body still remaining?

319
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,770
You're going to fight them?

320
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:40,710
Yes.

321
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,650
Excuse me...

322
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,580
It's me.

323
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:01,120
It's so... so good of you 
to come, Alphonse-kun.

324
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,400
Please teach me how to use the Philosopher's Stone.

325
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,220
As my tears well up,

326
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,220
afuredasu namida nara

327
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,390
I don't have to stop them now

329
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:17,710
I don't have to stop them now

331
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,500
At the end of all the grief,

00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,380

Stay... stay... stay... stay...

336
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:42,680
It's true, I cannot see you now,

338
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,780

00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:58,220
And I will go on making sure of that

motto tashikameteyuku no

344
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,730
As my tears well up,

345
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,730
afuredasu namida nara

346
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,460
I don't have to stop them now

347
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,460
ima wa tomenakute ii

348
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,230
Nor will I forget the pain

349
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,230
yasashisa ni kawatteku

350
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,490
as it becomes kindness

351
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,490
itami mo wasurenai

352
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:14,930
as it becomes kindness

353
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:14,930
itami mo wasurenai

354
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:22,630
That which I ruined in my haste,

355
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:22,630
isogisugite kowashitekita mono

356
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,710
I will take back so that

357
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,710
torimodosu no

358
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:33,130
I can walk on as I would

359
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:33,130
watashirashiku aruku tame ni

360
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,860
for you

361
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,620
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

362
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,920
Human Transmutation

363
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,870
Human Transmutation

364
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,940
Human Transmutation

365
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,980
Episode 46: "Human Transmutation"

366
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,320
Why do you want to 
become human—

367
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,240
something so worthless?
