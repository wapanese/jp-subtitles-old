1
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,570
That was close!

2
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,640
Forgive the intrusion.

3
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,410
Inside me?!

4
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,510
My, it's cozier than I expected.

5
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,660
Gross! I don't have any senses, but this still feels gross!

6
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,260
Get out!

7
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,340
We can't have that.

8
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,350
Even by doing this,

9
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,230
you can't completely 
control my movements!

10
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,820
Oh, I don't intend to match strengths with you.

11
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,040
As long as I can dampen 
your motions a little bit...

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,320
...we can finish this up.

13
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,000
Are you hurt?

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I bumped my forehead.

15
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,250
Alphonse Elric, 
you're coming with us...

16
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,720
to see our boss.

17
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,650
Having you come after us would be problematic.

18
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,980
Maybe I'll just crush 
one of your legs.

19
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,680
Let's go!

20
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,780
W-Wait!

21
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,880
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

22
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,470
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

23
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,530
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

24
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,980
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

25
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:26,650
Far away, far away, our dreams will never fade

26
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:26,650
tooku tooku omoi hatenaku

27
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,950
If only the two of us could go back to

28
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,950
futari ga mujaki ni waratteta

29
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,800
the days when we laughed so innocently

30
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,800
ano koro ni modoreru nara

31
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,900
the days when we laughed so innocently

32
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,900
ano koro ni modoreru nara

33
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,730
Just like glassware

34
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,730
konagona ni kudaketa

35
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,330
that has been smashed to pieces,

36
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,330
glass-zaiku no you na

37
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:57,120
we're putting together the fragments of our memories

38
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:57,120
omoide no kakera o atsumeteru

39
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,910
It's the important things that you notice

40
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,910
daiji na mono wa itsudatte

41
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,730
It's the important things that you notice

42
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,730
daiji na mono wa itsudatte

43
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:08,480
once you've lost them

44
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:08,480
nakushite kara kizuku yo

45
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,730
Oh, please, oh, please, stop time for me,

46
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,730
douka douka jikan o tomete

47
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:21,310
and engrave the way you look right now into my heart

48
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:21,310
kimi no omokage o kono mune ni kizandekure

49
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,860
And if, and if, I were ever allowed to,

50
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,860
moshimo moshimo yurusareru nara

51
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,270
I would be willing to sacrifice everything

52
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,270
subete o gisei ni shitemo ii

53
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,920
just to see that smiling face one more time

54
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,920
ano egao o mou ichido

55
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,040
Al, Captured

56
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,040
Al, Captured

57
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,160
So, where are the boys?

58
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,980
Alphonse-kun was 
taken away by someone,

59
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,370
and Edward-kun gave chase.

60
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,740
While you were here, 
and you just let them go?

61
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,340
This had been 
dropped in the garden.

62
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,820
Devil's Nest?

63
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,360
Apparently it is a bar 
outside of town.

64
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,670
You're worried about 
Alphonse-kun, huh?

65
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,850
This wasn't your doing, was it?

66
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,360
If it were, I wouldn't have had them kidnap him here, would I?

67
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,360
Beyond the forest...

68
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,490
out in the rest of the world, the fighting continues.

69
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:15,230
The coals of the quarrel are stoked by malice;

70
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,210
sparks keep flying out, 
and it spreads ever farther.

71
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:23,090
Why don't people 
try to end the strife?

72
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,610
Not everyone secludes themselves in the middle of a forest,

73
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,860
thinking of nothing 
but alchemy, like you do.

74
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,570
As long as they continue to 
seek the Philosopher's Stone,

75
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,980
sooner or later, disaster is going to befall those two.

76
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,110
Why won't you stop them?

77
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,960
Those two will come upon their answer on their own.

78
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,870
Whatever answer that answer turns out to be,

79
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,800
at least it will be an answer different from your ideals.

80
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,090
You still can't bring 
yourself to believe?

81
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,710
You and I are different, after all.

82
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,720
Both in our way of life 
and in our alchemy.

83
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,190
You're going, then?

84
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,410
Yes.

85
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,630
Farewell, Izumi.

86
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,040
I doubt we will ever 
see each other again.

87
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,050
Sorry about this.

88
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,630
I have to be on the lookout. 
I know it must be icky having me inside,

89
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,050
but try to put up with it.

90
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,610
It's okay, I've gotten used to it. 
Just don't touch my bloodseal, okay?

91
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,810
I won't be able to stay in this world if you do.

92
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,060
Say, Mister, how come 
you became Chimeras?

93
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,010
We all used to be soldiers 
a long time ago.

94
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,530
We were severely injured 
on the battlefield out east.

95
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,770
While we were half-dead, we were taken to the military's lab facilities,

96
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,870
where we were turned into experimental subjects.

97
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,440
The 5th Laboratory...

98
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,800
That's right.

99
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:32,110
And it was Greed-san who 
broke us out of that laboratory.

100
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,300
Greed...

101
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,810
That man gave us a place where we could live.

102
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,680
That I did.

103
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,460
See, this is a hangout where folks who, 
for whatever little reason,

104
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,210
can no longer go on 
living out in the open.

105
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,820
Tucker-san...

106
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,720
Tucker-san, are you...

107
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,970
D-Don't misunderstand. 
I'm not here because I want to be.

108
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,090
The doctor here is the only one 
who can cure us Chimeras, you see.

109
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,410
Whoa, this is awesome!

110
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:15,050
Dr. Tucker, it's just like you said. 
He really is hollow.

111
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,040
I-I'm not the one who had you kidnapped, you understand.

112
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,810
Nice to meet you, boy.

113
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,070
The name's Greed. 
Let's be friends.

114
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,510
An Uroboros tattoo...

115
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,880
You know about this?

116
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,740
That speeds things up.

117
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,700
Then you're friends with those 
other people, like Envy and Lust?

118
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,160
Nope. They're more like 
my enemies than my friends.

119
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,750
Then why are you doing this?

120
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,720
Al... was it?

121
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:54,610
How does it feel to be just 
a spirit body—someone who can't die?

122
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,440
Transmuting an individual soul 
and bonding it to some other object—

123
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,120
in other words, never getting hungry, growing tired, or growing any older.

124
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,230
That's what folks call 
eternal life, isn't it?

125
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,400
Eternal life...

126
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,950
You kidnapped me because that's what you want?

127
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,450
I have powerful appetites, you see.

128
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,290
I want money! I want women!

129
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,960
Status, too! Fame, too!

130
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,460
I want all that this world has! 
And that goes for eternal life, too.

131
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,250
You understand me? 
You have the potential for that.

132
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,970
You're going to 
cooperate with me.

133
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,080
If you refuse, I'm still going to get the secret of your soul,

134
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,980
even if I have to dismantle you.

135
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,940
What nonsense. You really are a bad person after all, Mister.

136
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,950
It's up to you whether or not you act tough,

137
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,440
but there's no one who's going to rescue you from this situation.

138
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,710
My brother was together with me back there.

139
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,920
I'm sure he's on his way here.

140
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,670
That's not possible. 
I beat him senseless.

141
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,850
You really <i>are</i> a bad person!

142
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:22,130
You let your guard down! 
I'll take care of these chains with alchemy—

143
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,180
You'll do what?

144
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,950
Hey, relax, huh?

145
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,690
Oh, sorry, Martel.

146
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,140
I forgot you were in there.

147
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,420
I like a guy who can 
set his mind to something.

148
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,440
But that's not going to 
do you any good at all.

149
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,190
If you want to defeat me,

150
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,620
you'll have to do 
something like this.

151
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,210
How could you do that?! 
You guys are friends, aren't you?!

152
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,880
That makes me dead once.

153
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,200
Hey, can't you be a little neater when you do that?

154
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,880
Terribly sorry.

155
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,490
Even with this body, 
I'm not exactly immortal.

156
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,190
Brother!

157
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,500
Brother!

158
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,280
Pardon me for intruding.

159
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,220
S-Sensei!

160
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,270
Sweetheart, who are you?

161
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,460
A housewife!

162
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,840
Hold up, Edward Elric!

163
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,890
You're looking for 
your brother, right?

164
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,100
Have you been following me?!

165
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,230
You just watched quietly while Al was kidnapped?!

166
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,240
We are pursuing them as well.

167
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,920
We couldn't allow your brother's safety to take top priority.

168
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,740
Don't give me that!

169
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,040
We are about to raid the Chimeras' stronghold.

170
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,620
He should be there too.

171
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,500
Tell me where this place is!

172
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,420
A bar called "Devil's Nest."

173
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,970
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

174
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,180
You can't just start whaling on us 
without any warning.

175
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,050
Are you the one in charge?

176
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,560
You're looking after 
one of mine, aren't you?

177
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,880
You're going to 
let me take him home.

178
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,790
No can do.

179
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,820
I see...

180
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,530
Really... everything 
you do is so sudden.

181
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,740
You didn't break 
your fingers, did you?

182
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,750
Sensei!

183
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,590
That's a pretty unusual body 
you've got there.

184
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:44,950
I suppose. It won't be all that easy for you to inflict even a single injury on me.

185
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,140
Oh, yeah?

186
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,220
In that case, I'm going to start taking this seriously, too.

187
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,710
Sensei! Is Brother around?!

188
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,430
That's what I'd like to know!

189
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,490
I mean, you two can't even 
run a decent errand for me!

190
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,160
Brace yourself, because afterward, 
you're going to get a proper scolding!

191
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,620
I-I'm sorry!

192
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,530
No transmutation circle?!

193
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,290
You're not going to dodge me?

194
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,790
I'm not given to raising 
my hand against women.

195
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,750
I just...

196
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,920
want to learn the secret of his transmutation.

197
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,760
And when you do?

198
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,980
Gain eternal life, 
and then everything else.

199
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,680
This isn't going anywhere.

200
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,590
You got him!

201
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,360
Like I said,

202
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,780
it won't be all that easy for you to inflict even a single injury on me.

203
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,540
Dear...

204
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,550
I've had enough 
of just looking on.

205
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,550
I'm not...

206
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,640
about to...

207
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,230
lose one of my children...

208
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,060
again.

209
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,420
Yeah.

210
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:28,740
My, my, are you still planning to go at it some more?

211
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,460
There you are!

212
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,660
Izumi!

213
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,750
Sensei!

214
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,680
You've overdone it there, sweetheart.

215
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,690
Okay, you're going to cease your futile resistance.

216
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,190
I don't wanna have to do this,

217
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,670
but if you resist, 
you know what happens.

218
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,320
You get your filthy hands off of her!

219
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,290
On the double! Fifth and Seventh Squads, 
cover the rear entrance!

220
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,010
Third and Ninth Squads, 
seal off the area around the bar.

221
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,350
The rest of you, take the front!

222
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,760
Now we've got the older brother, huh? We've got our whole cast together.

223
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,240
Tucker?

224
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,750
Edward-kun...

225
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,020
You too?

226
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,890
You'll pay for this!

227
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,950
Not only have you kidnapped Al, 
but you've gone and hurt Sensei, too!

228
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:47,480
Hey now, if you would just tell me how to bond a spirit, I'll just—

229
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,980
Shut up! You're going to return both Al and Sensei to me!

230
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,400
Be careful, Brother!

231
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,110
That man is a homunculus!

232
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,580
Look, I've got a hostage right here.

233
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,580
Is that right? No wonder!

234
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,930
Sheesh, would all of you 
just listen to me?!

235
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,630
Sensei!

236
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,310
Ed!

237
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,070
Right!

238
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,390
Like I said,

239
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:22,470
I'm the Mightiest Shield.

240
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,010
Sensei!

241
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,980
Izumi!

242
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,490
Now hold on!

243
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,990
This is a one-on-one fight.

244
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,960
Take care of Sensei.

245
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,250
Yeah.

246
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,460
If you want to defeat me,

247
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,960
then fight with 
the intent to kill me.

248
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,160
Yeah.

249
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,130
I'm going to send you flying, no matter what!

250
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,300
Ready to storm in 
through the back door.

251
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,180
The alley has been sealed off.

252
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,180
Ready to charge in!

253
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,620
That won't work!

254
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,700
For crying out loud...

255
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,600
I had no idea you guys were this hard to get through to!

256
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,500
What?

257
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,180
You even committed a taboo 
in order to obtain what you wanted.

258
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,700
As someone so loyal 
to their desires,

259
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,510
I didn't think it would be so hard for you to understand me.

260
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,210
Don't you lump me in with the likes of you!

261
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,020
We're the same.

262
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:49,200
Whether we're homunculus or human, it doesn't matter.

263
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,520
We live only to be devoted to our desires, don't we?

264
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,830
Not me!

265
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:58,240
I know about how you are now 
looking for the Philosopher's Stone.

266
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,260
I don't care about 
the Philosopher's Stone.

267
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,920
I just want to return Al—

268
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,710
my brother—to his original form!

269
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,800
He'd be better off 
staying the way he is.

270
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,000
What do you know?! Don't you presume to decide that for us!

271
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,710
I have no intention of negotiating.

272
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,720
If you homunculi are born of 
the errors made by us alchemists,

273
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,970
then we alchemists will just 
have to correct those errors.

274
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,520
Is that a fact?

275
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,650
This kind of turns me into an ugly man, 
so I was hoping not to have to show it to you.

276
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,500
But out of consideration 
for your resolve,

277
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,300
I'm going to take you on seriously.

278
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,720
What is that?

279
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,910
This is my serious mode.

280
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:48,800
Bring it on!

281
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,390
Barely felt that.

282
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,120
Are you serious?!

283
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,930
The composition and structural material of my body is as normal.

284
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,480
The Mightiest Shield, huh?

285
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,180
You've never killed 
someone before, have you?

286
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,400
What do you mean?

287
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,780
I'm saying you don't have the heart to do it.

288
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,000
You won't be able to 
defeat me like this.

289
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,790
And that goes for 
the other homunculi too.

290
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,950
Let me give you enough heart.

291
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,650
Who the hell are you?!

292
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,680
Hey there.

293
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,800
Greed-san!

294
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,010
Bad news! The military—

295
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,520
Greed-san!

296
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,770
Now of all times... 
The big show is going to be ruined.

297
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,780
Is this really the time 
to be acting so casual?

298
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,260
Don't panic.

299
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,400
There's no one in the military who can do anything to us.

300
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,350
Kimbly...

301
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,880
Why, you! You betrayed me!

302
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,640
Greed-san!

303
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,350
Come on, we're going!

304
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,580
Wait!

305
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,560
Catch you later, boy.

306
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,890
You're not getting away from me!

307
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:40,930
What is this?

308
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,570
Please do not resist.

309
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,200
Resist? What are you talking—

310
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,440
Lt. Col. Archer is calling for you. 
Please come with us.

311
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,980
They're about to take my brother away! 
I can't just sit back and—

312
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,330
That is an order.

313
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,420
On the day you left,

314
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,420
On the day you left,

315
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,420
kimi ga tabidatsu hi wa

316
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,420
kimi ga tabidatsu hi wa

317
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:21,710
I said good-bye and waved, like always

318
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:21,710
I said good-bye and waved, like always

319
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:21,710
itsumo to onaji 'jaa ne' to te o futta

320
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:21,710
itsumo to onaji 'jaa ne' to te o futta

321
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,930
Almost as if I would see you again

322
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,930
Almost as if I would see you again

323
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,930
maru de ashita mo mata

324
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,930

326
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:33,070

To believe in love

To believe in love

336
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:40,520

338
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:46,840
is to not give up on yourself

341
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:53,870
And until the day my dream comes true,

342
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:53,870
And until the day my dream comes true,

343
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:53,870

344
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:53,870

00:22:54,580 --> 00:23:00,050
I will be here with a smile as I look up at the stars,

346
00:22:54,580 --> 00:23:00,050
I will be here with a smile as I look up at the stars,

347
00:22:54,580 --> 00:23:00,050

00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:04,200
offering up a prayer

350
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:04,200
offering up a prayer

351
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:04,200

352
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:04,200

353
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:04,700
