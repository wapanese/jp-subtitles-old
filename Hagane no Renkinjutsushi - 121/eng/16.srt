00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,500
Good luck with that, soldier.

2
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,560
I can smell the Ishbalan stray dog.

3
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,600
But...

4
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,280
he's gone now.

5
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,070
Say, Brother,

6
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,830
what's going to happen to Marcoh-san?

7
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,300
The Führer said he was going to look after him.

8
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,610
What can we do about it?

9
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,280
The Central Library?

10
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,730
Marcoh-san had to hide all of his materials right under the military's nose.

11
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,840
And this...

12
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,740
What do you suppose that means?

13
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,970
I don't know.

14
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,650
In any case, let's keep this a secret from the Colonel and the others.

15
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,980
Brother?

16
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,810
Whether or not we can trust them anymore...

17
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,980
I'm not sure.

18
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,980
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

19
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,580
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

20
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,610
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

21
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,000
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

22
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,140
Ready, steady, can't hold me back

23
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,490
Ready, steady, give me good luck

24
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,790
Ready, steady, never look back

25
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,190
Let's get started, ready, steady, go!

26
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,340

That Which Is Lost

66
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,480
You're leaving so suddenly?

67
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,030
Mm-hmm. Now that we know that Scar is in East City,

68
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,730
everyone seems to have become 
worried about Central all of a sudden.

69
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,450
Sorry to have inconvenienced you, 
but we're going back.

70
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,820
Before you do, 
what is your punishment?

71
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,070
Punishment?

72
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,580
I knew where the Crystal Alchemist was, 
and yet I left him alone.

73
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,710
You've done well.

74
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,300
I wanted to place him in protective custody.

75
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,670
The officer directly underneath me—
Grand—was against it,

76
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:06,550
but he put his research to use on the battlefield, which must have tormented him.

77
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,070
At this late date, I would like to make it up to him.

78
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,320
However, concerning his research...

79
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,310
That will be all.

80
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,060
I will continue to rely on you.

81
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,570
May you have a safe journey.

82
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,330
The Philosopher's Stone...

83
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,140
does not exist.

84
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,630
As you can see, I'm fine.

85
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,880
You'd probably shape up 
if you did get punished once.

86
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,880
He never seems to 
let his guard down.

87
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,100
Creation follows destruction!

88
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,290

Th-That's all right...

92
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,740
The method of bonding a soul to armor...

93
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,200
is only known by one person:

94
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,160
Fullmetal.

95
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,210
Yeah, and for that to happen, I first 
need to do something about my arm.

96
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,710
You're right. After all, if Edward-kun is unable to use his alchemy...

97
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,710
...he's just a sharp-tongued brat.

98
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,800
Anyhow, I'm going to my mechanic.

99
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,510
Colonel, you know who, right?

100
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,770
Yeah. I saw our good-for-nothing alchemist there once, bawling in pain.

101
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,440
"It hurts! It hurts so bad! 
I'm going to pee my pants!" Right?

102
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,450
What are you going to do once you're fixed up?

103
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,070
I'm going to Central.

104
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,830
There's something I want to look up in the library there.

105
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,090
That's going to be a long trip.

106
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,960
Which means...

107
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,960
Since I'm part of the Führer's party, I won't be able to accompany you.

108
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,760
I can't very well leave here.

109
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,380
And I have to 
keep an eye on him.

110
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,800
I don't think I'd be able to protect 
those two from such a dangerous guy.

111
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,270
That goes for me too!

112
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,770
That settles it, then.

113
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:21,520
I shall escort these two during their journey!

We don't need that!

What are you going to do if Scar 
attacks you again in your condition?

122
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,630
You can't carry Al 
like that either, can you?

123
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,110
Children should listen to adults.

124

Y-You're calling us children?! Al, say something!

125
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:49,090
Brother! This is the first time anyone has ever treated me like a child since I got this body!

126
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,080
Very well, Edward Elric...

127
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,100
Shall we begin packing?

128
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,640
This is the first time anyone has ever 
treated me like luggage since I got this body.

129
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,010
For crying out loud...

130
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,380
Hey, newspaper? 
I've got tea as well!

131
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,540
Shoo, shoo!

132
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,510
Hey, I've got a message from Roy.

133
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,630
From the Colonel?

134
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,710
"Don't go dying under my command. 
It's a pain having to deal with everything."

135
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,530
That is all.

136
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:34,700
Tell him, "Roger. There's no way I'm going to die ahead of you, you grubby colonel."

137
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,420
And while you're at it, 
take this escort with you, too.

138
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,350
Hey, now...

139
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,280
I don't know what Marcoh told you,

140
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,940
but let me inform you of one thing.

141
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,930
Three years ago,

142
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,430
we discovered the body of a young girl who had been transmuted into a Chimera.

143
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,950
Nina?!

144
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,690
The way she was torn apart...

145
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,450
It turns out to be identical to Scar's method of alchemy.

146
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,740
Thanks, man.

147
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,780
Now I can take him on.

148
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,830
I'll see you in Central. I'll apply for permission to browse at the first branch.

149
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,680
You'll have to excuse me for using my left hand.

150
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,530
Central... Central's first... 
first something-or-other!

151
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,860
Central Library, First Branch.

152
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,520
Mm-hmm!

153
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,870
That's enough, right?

154
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,600
Brother!

155
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,010
Sorry about that.

156
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,020
What is the Führer... 
What is the Führer's answer?

157
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,620
You told that boy where your materials are hidden, didn't you?

158
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,630
What are you talking about?

159
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,420
That's okay.

160
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,120
The boy will come even closer to the Philosopher's Stone.

161
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,750
However, I would be a little upset

162
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,500
if you wrote down anything extra in those materials.

163
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:36,270
The boy is smart. Once he reads it, he won't do as you want him to.

164
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,650
Which is why, before he does,

165
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,230
I thought I'd look into it myself, you see?

166
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,520
That won't be possible.

167
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,000
You're going to die...

168
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,150
right here!

169
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,190
That was cruel.

170
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,250
I've already died once, you know.

171
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,250
So that's it!

172
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,760
Just like the stories say, 
you guys are...

173
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,120
Gluttony...

174
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,930
Tell me...

175
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:27,050
Where did you tell the boy you hid your materials?

176
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,410
Whew, I've had it, Al.

177
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,090
That guy just keeps 
going on and on,

178
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,230
and all he does is brag about his family background.

179
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,130
Let me take a break here—

180
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:45,740
Al?

181
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,930
Al? Al? Al? Al? Al?

182
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,830
Al? Al? Al? Al? Al?

183
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,710
Al? Al? Al? Al? Al?

184
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,470
Al? Al? Al? Al? Al?

185
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,250
Al? Al? Al? Al? Al?

186
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:51,930
Al?!

187
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,700
Al got mistaken for someone else's luggage and was dropped off at the last station!

188
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,720
Hm? That won't do. We'll go back for him at the next station.

189
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,090
I can't wait that long!

190
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,500
Now, now...

191
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,640
Stay out of my way!

192
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,140
Calm down, Edward Elric.

193
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,150
What else could I do?

194
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:17,750
If I, a suit of armor, said "not here," they would just be stunned by me.

195
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,980
I wonder if Brother has noticed.

196
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,620
<i>I'm</i> the one who wants to cry, here!

197
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,160
Uh-oh...

198
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,930
He wouldn't have gone off somewhere by himself!

199
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,190
You're sure...

200
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,900
it was this armor?

201
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,000
Mm-hmm.

202
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,690
You're good at drawing, huh?

203
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,850
It's a technique for drawing likenesses that has been passed down in my family for generations.

204
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,550
How can you be 
taking this so lightly?!

205
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,200
Wait, it's too dangerous! 
What's the hurry?

206
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,200
You guys just don't understand us!

207
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,380
What?

208
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,200
I heard from Doctor Marcoh!

209
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,210
About what happened in Ishbal!

210
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,570
Say, do you know anything about some armor that was at the train station?

211
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,050
Like who might've taken it?

212
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,580
It was large and dark...

213
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,190
Just a second, please!

214
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,030
Ee-yow...

215
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,060
Hey! Hold it!

216
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,330
Hold on!

217
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,030
Hold on, I tell you!

218
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:34,080
Damn. If I had my arm and leg, this wouldn't be so hard...

219
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,850
<i>This is trouble... We're getting farther 
and farther away from the train station.</i>

220
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,920
Ahem...

221
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,860
Am I hearing things?

222
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,850
I'm right here. This armor.

223
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,350
That didn't hurt at all! With this...

224
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,000
Um...

225
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,090
It's doing it again!

226
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:27,240
Please don't be startled. I'm...

227
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,340
Um, I'm...

228
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,560
the latest model of armor.

229
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,580
We're popular now in Central. Talking armor.

230
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,660
Where's your switch?! Be quiet!

231
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,780
Um, you can't turn me off.

232
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,360
Just keep quiet, then.

233
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,500
Um, where are we going?

234
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,360
To a fight.

235
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,370
A fight?

236
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,750
Boss Poe said that 
if I wanted to be like him,

237
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,470
I should go rub out a guy or two.

238
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,360
So I told him that I would go 
lay into the Damousha family,

239
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,340
who are always 
invading our territory.

240
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,260
If I bring back one of 
their heads like this,

241
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,430
then no one will treat me like a kid anymore.

242
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,600
I'll be accepted as the boss's right-hand-man!

243
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,520
I'll do it! I'll flatten them!

244
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,690
You're not, by any chance, going to go kill someone?

245
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,990
You're some pretty good armor.

246
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,740
I won't even have to worry if they pull a gun on me.

247
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,730
That's why you're wearing me?

248
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,230
So it won't hurt?

249
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,000
That's right. As long as I'm not hurt, I can go all-out.

250
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,910
It's still going to hurt.

251
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,190
What? Are you a defective product?

252
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,630
I'm sure it will hurt.

253
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,750
In your heart.

254
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,890
Don't be silly.

255
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,030
Or would you rather you didn't feel pain in your heart?

256
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,610
Relax your arm.

257
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,530
Wh-What is this?!

258
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,030
I am the Cursed Farmer... I mean,

259
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,030
Nyoroi no Noroi

260
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,480
the Cursed Armor.

261
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,480
Noroi no Yoroi

262
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,460
Once you become one with me,

263
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:22,890
your mind and body will never 
feel pain again, forever and ever.

264
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,540
I'm sorry about this.

265
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,120
Having been made to live alone together with an old man,

266
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,900
she was thinking of what was best for the future, in her own way.

267
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,120
So she was just hoping to make things easier for her grandpa, huh?

268
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,680
You did pretty well 
to have noticed this.

269
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,440
I can't give you this,

270
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,190
but if you want, I could introduce you 
to the engineer who made it.

271
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,050
She's got a sharp tongue 
but decent skills.

272
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,660
I appreciate the offer, 
but I don't need an artificial leg.

273
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,870
Once you get used to it, 
it's pretty handy.

274
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,870
Perhaps so. However...

275
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:06,210
However, I'd like to leave my leg the way it is.

276
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,910
A sword wound I received on 
the battlefield became infected.

277
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,310
By the time they carried me to the rear, all they could do was cut it off.

278
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,110
Battlefield... You were a soldier?

279
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,080
Which war?

280
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,400
The one up north?

281
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,900
Or...

282
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,480
You don't mean Ishbal?!

283
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,740
On the battlefield, 
everyone becomes some other creature.

284
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,840
You can carry out even the most cruel acts without any feeling.

285
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,480
In order to protect myself, my mind must have shut out all emotions.

286
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:53,260
But once the war is over, 
you can't keep doing that.

287
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:59,100
I must not forget what I saw there... 
what I did there.

288
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,100
When I look at this injury, it allows me to remember it all immediately.

289
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,320
And that's why...

290
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,380
That's why you don't want 
any Automail?! That isn't very—

291
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,610
That's not the only reason.

292
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,860
I lost my leg.

293
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,160
However, I have gained something even more important.

294
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,420
Peace of mind, and a life with my grandchildren. You see...

295
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:32,180
It's once a person loses something 
that they first gain something, is it not?

296
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,880
You think so?

297
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,520
There are those who've 
gone to war and come back fine.

298
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,130
That's what soldiers do.

299
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,140
Those people have lost something.

300
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,130
Even if it isn't something 
visible to the eye.

301
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,150
If you've lost something yourself, 
then you should've gained something as well.

302
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,990
In alchemy, that is what's known as equivalent exchange, right?

303
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,990
How can that be?!

304
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:10,190
I lost my right arm and left leg...

305
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,650
and my brother lost his whole body.

306
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:18,800
We're living desperately just to get them back!

307
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,010
Taking everything back—

308
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,210
that's what our dream is!

309
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,180
There isn't a thing 
we've gained in return!

310
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,770
Everything...

311
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,500
has been taken from us!

312
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,160
A dream to take everything back...

313
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,850
But then, once that comes true, 
what will you do?

314
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,080
A dream that is granted can't be called a real dream at all.

315
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,060
Even so...

316
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,050
Even so, we're going to take it back.

317
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,570
Thanks for the tea.

318
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,490
Brother!

319
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,360
Grandpa, Brother is home!

320
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,890
Oh, that's right! Al!

321
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:53,920
Al!

322
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,150
Yes!

323
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,860
Al...

324
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,380
Al,

325
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,310
you reek of sheep.

326
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:12,030
Well, excuse me! Fine, when we get to 
Grandma Pinako's house, I'll get washed up.

327
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,340
Say, Al...

328
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,880
Four years ago, when the Colonel came to Resembool,

329
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,920
he said it was because he happened to look at the letter we sent out, right?

330
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,860
That's what he said.

331
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,930
He was searching for Dad.

332
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,450
But, by any chance, do you think the reason 
that the Colonel went to Granny's house was...

333
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,980
Major...

334
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,030
I was worried about you.

335
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,810
Sorry about that.

336
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,900
What's wrong?

337
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,830
Major...

338
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,910
I'm sorry about earlier...

339
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,670
Oh, no!

340
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:00,800
If we miss this one, we'll have to wait until tomorrow at noon!

341
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,960
H-Hey! What are you doing?!

342
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,960
We're going to run!

343
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,260
This is the method of 
short-distance sprinting

344
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,280
that has been passed down 
through my family for generations!

345
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,050
Put me down!

346
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,050
I'm going to break!

347
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,770
We are still crying out

348
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,770
bokura wa ima demo sakenderu

349
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,850
You squeeze your right hand, as if to reassure yourself

350
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,850
tashikameru you ni nigirishimeta migite

351
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,700
Go on, take those annoying rules and dash them away!

352
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,700
uzattai housoku o buchikowashite yuke

353
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,840
If it comes down to having to rest your wounded feet,

354
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,840
kizutsuita ashi o yasumaseru gurai nara

355
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,730
you've gotta keep moving forward, if only just a step!

356
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,730
tatta ippo demo koko kara susume

357
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,500
We've pushed our way

358
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,500
through the twisting winds

359
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,500
yuganda kaze o kaki wakete

360
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,630
and gotten beyond the cold sky

361
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,630
tsumetai sora o oikoshite

362
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,400
Yet we still continue to wander

363
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,400
soredemo mada samayoi tsuzuketeru

364
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,570
We always find ourselves crying out

365
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,570
bokura wa itsudemo sakenderu

366
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:11,910
Just continuing to believe is not the answer

367
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:11,910
shinji tsuzukeru dake ga kotae janai

368
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,620
We must bare our weaknesses and wounds,

369
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,620
yowasa mo kizu mo sarake dashite

370
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,300
and continue to struggle,

371
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,300
or nothing will ever turn out!

372
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,300
mogaki tsuzukenakereba hajimaranai

373
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:29,000
Break on through to the other side of the door!

374
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:29,000
tsukiyabure tobira no mukou e

375
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,600
To the other side of the door!

376
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,600
tobira no mukou e

377
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,730
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

378
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,960
House of the Waiting Family

379
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,910
House of the Waiting Family

380
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,980
House of the Waiting Family

381
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,180
Episode 17: "House of the Waiting Family"

382
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,720
On the day we left,

383
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,530
we burned down our house.

384
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,150
We had nowhere to return home to.

385
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,280
Or so we thought...
