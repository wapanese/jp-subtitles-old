1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,980
Those are Ishbalans, right?

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,720
I wonder what 
they're doing here.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,210
The military is with them. 
I'm sure they're under escort.

4
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,740
This sure is taking a long time.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,330
I heard they're having some 
kind of trouble getting water.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,420
What's going on here?

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,420
That should delay 
their departure a little.

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,240
Yeah, that's a relief. Now we don't have to go all the way to the southern camp.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,900
So then, what did you guys do?

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,510
You think we did something?

11
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,640
Your pals just suddenly 
showed up and grabbed us.

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,400
That's awful.

13
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,090
Ishbalans have their 
own residential areas.

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,150
If you leave them 
and band together,

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,200
you'll make a good target 
for the military.

16
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:55,960
By the way, Scar said that the Ishbalans had once created a Philosopher's Stone.

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,910
We're looking for someone who knows the details about that.

18
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,650
You guys were good friends with Scar-san, right?

19
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,880
We were <i>not</i> good friends 
with that guy!

20
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,380
We don't have anything to tell the military.

21
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,920
We do not know anything,

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,300
but there is an old man who 
lives on the outskirts of Kishua

23
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,700
who might know 
something about it.

24
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,190
Chief!

25
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,890
These two should be 
able to show you where.

26
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,970
You want us to go there?!

27
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,980
How's that?

28
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,660
At least get the children out of here, is that what you're saying?

29
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,690
Brother, their information 
must come at a cost, right?

30
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,570
Equivalent exchange.

31
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,950
It is not part of our teachings, 
but I don't see how it can be helped.

32
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,750
Chief...

33
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,660
We'll throw in a shower 
at no extra charge.

34
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,170
Get them outside, 
or else they'll get cooked!

35
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,680
Let's go!

36
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,730
Sorry...

37
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,140
Hey!

38
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,380
What are you doing?!

39
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,650
Ed! Al!

40
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,490
Hop in!

41
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,110
Winry, did you steal that? You can't do that!

42
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,070
No! They said it's mine if I could fix it. 
Who do they think I am?

43
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,530
You guys!

44
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,160
We're out of here!

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,880
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

46
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,470
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

47
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,520
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

48
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:53,020
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

49
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:06,690
Far away, far away, our dreams will never fade

50
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:06,690
tooku tooku omoi hatenaku

51
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,990
If only the two of us could go back to

52
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,990
futari ga mujaki ni waratteta

53
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,840
the days when we laughed so innocently

55
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,940
the days when we laughed so innocently

57
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:23,770

59
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,370

61
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:37,160
we're putting together the fragments of our memories

omoide no kakera o atsumeteru

63
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,950
It's the important things that you notice

65
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,770
It's the important things that you notice

67
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:48,520

00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,770
Oh, please, oh, please, stop time for me,

71
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:01,350
and engrave the way you look right now into my heart

75
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,310
I would be willing to sacrifice everything

77
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:15,960

79
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,990
The Sinner Within Us

80
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,990
The Sinner Within Us

81
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,000
Kishua is a bit westward, right?

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,400
No problem, no problem!

83
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,250
This sure will help, huh, Brother?

84
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,460
Winry, how long are you 
planning to tag along with us?

85
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,460
What's this now, 
out of the puny?

86
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,600
That's "out of the blue"!

87
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,070
What I mean is, 
go home already.

88
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,600
If I'm not around, 
who's going to fix your Automail?

89
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
It's hard on me too.

90
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,730
I wanted to return that child homunculus' arm and leg to Brother,

91
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,970
even if it meant 
yanking them off of him.

92
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,030
But I couldn't do that 
in front of you, Winry.

93
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,540
You couldn't do that 
in the first place.

94
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,110
Yeah, Al, you couldn't do that.

95
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,120
But I could, if it was 
to achieve our goal.

96
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,620
Brother...

97
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,330
A long time ago,

98
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,920
there was this guy who said it was simple for someone to kill another person.

99
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,570
And indeed, even though it was unavoidable,

100
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,470
I allowed an alchemist named Majhal to die, long ago.

101
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,970
That was an accident. 
You were trying to save him, Brother.

102
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,970
And in the 5th Laboratory, 
I nearly killed all of those prisoners.

103
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,980
Their lives seemed to pale in comparison with Al's body.

104
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,310
That's what I thought.

105
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,190
But you couldn't do it.

106
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,190
And then there's Scar...

107
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,200
If he stands in my way again,

108
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,140
then, like I did to Greed, 
I'm going to...

109
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,580
Kill him?

110
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,350
Are you going to kill that guy?

111
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,070
But that's the man who...

112
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,170
That traitor deserves to be killed.

113
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,640
In any event, 
our dangerous battle goes on.

114
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,660
We can't have anyone 
slowing us down.

115
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,770
Winry!

116
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,180
We'll see if I slow you down!

117
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,740
It's as though 
there was a war here.

118
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,950
You've never even seen a war.

119
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,500
I have.

120
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,330
We have. 
This is just like that day...

121
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,500
the day our mom died.

122
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,210
The military people 
surrounded the city,

123
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,340
but we didn't 
even do anything.

124
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,300
And yet, why did they...

125
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,890
Mom! Mom!

126
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,890
R-Rick!

127
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:57,730
Mom!

128
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,510
Rick! Stop!

129
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,560
Stop it.

130
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,260
What's the matter?

131
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,910
We don't want to go 
to that defiled place.

132
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,670
Okay then, Winry...

133
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,310
Pardon us.

134
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,080
Brother!

135
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,490
Is that...

136
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,770
It's just like the one on Scar-san's right arm.

137
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,650
As well as the one under the 5th Laboratory.

138
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,780
You two, come on out!

139
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,950
Lieutenant! Don't start shooting out of nowhere like that!

140
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,320
I figured you would 
be able to dodge it.

141
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,330
If you knew it was us in the 
first place, then don't shoot!

142
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,080
That was for 
Sergeant Fuery's bruise.

143
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,800
It's all right. We'll wait for Ed and Al here, okay?

144
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,550
Where's the Colonel?

145
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,430
He went back to Central 
with Warrant Officer Falman.

146
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,430
So after putting on this sort of display, he ran right back home, huh?

147
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:24,100
You can't abide the way the Colonel acted against the Ishbalans,

148
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,150
so you attacked the escort train?

149
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:32,650
No, but right now, it's not as though the Ishbalans are starting any wars,

150
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,300
so you don't have to go around using force to control them.

151
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,950
Don't misunderstand.

152
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,810
There weren't any fatalities 
among the Ishbalans this time.

153
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,130
There was one former 
soldier who died.

154
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,290
A man named Yoki, 
whom you two knew.

155
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,380
Yoki? That old guy is dead?

156
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,880
There were shots fired from the Ishbalan side, and Yoki was hit.

157
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,380
Tensions flared as a result.

158
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,520
The Colonel stepped forward, 
and with a display of his power,

159
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,870
he dashed the 
Ishbalan's will to fight.

160
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,750
If he hadn't done that, there would have been more casualties on both sides.

161
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,780
Not a bad piece of work 
for a soldier.

162
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,390
Are you discriminating against him 
because he's a soldier?

163
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,110
You're a member of 
the military too, you know.

164
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,650
We've decided to move most of 
the people to the camp in the south.

165
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:31,050
But we have to determine who it was that fired first and punish them.

166
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,970
In order to do that, we're still having several of them remain here.

167
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,050
There's an old man among them, right? The one who lived in that shack.

168
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,770
This is pretty tightly secured here, huh? 
Is he a material witness?

169
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,920
No, the old man is not a suspect. We're just protecting him.

170
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,030
Protecting him?

171
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,030
Those are the Ishbalans 
who are under arrest, right?

172
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:03,820
They attacked him. Called him a heretic and an outcast.

173
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,250
Apparently, he's not 
regarded as being Ishbalan.

174
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:12,750
That's ridiculous! I mean, the Ishbalans have always suffered discrimination!

175
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,250
And yet, even among themselves...

176
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,050
Outcasts?

177
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,500
What kind of people are they?

178
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,230
They're defiled.

179
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,430
They're people who have disobeyed the teachings of Ishbala.

180
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,140
He has a tattoo on his face. 
That is the mark of an outcast.

181
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,770
When you say they disobey the teachings, what exactly?

182
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,350
It's what Mom told us.

183
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,860
Yeah. Believe in the god Ishbala.

184
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,280
Otherwise, you'll become an outcast.

185
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,290
But I didn't know that 
he was an outcast too.

186
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,820
"He"?

187
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,360
The one that you call Scar.

188
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,790
He's an outcast!

189
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,360
He's a traitor!

190
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,510
What kind of person 
was your mother?

191
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,310
You know, she was very nice.

192
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,280
Even though her eyes were unwell,

193
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,700
she worked for everyone, in a hospital.

194
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,210
In a hospital?

195
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,230
The Philosopher's Stone, huh?

196
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,470
This is the third time 
I've been asked about it.

197
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,610
The third time?

198
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,960
That scarred young man,

199
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,370
and long ago, his older brother asked me the same question.

200
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,070
Scar and his brother?

201
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,990
Then Scar's brother created 
a Philosopher's Stone before?

202
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,750
No.

203
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:38,260
He did not make one. 
The young man was too humane.

204
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,140
But why do you know about the Philosopher's Stone?

205
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,120
You're an Ishbalan, right?

206
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,430
I am an outcast. 
I learned the Grand Art.

207
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,370
The Grand Art?

208
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,420
Once, we Ishbalans

209
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,260
had a secret art that had been passed down, 
which we called the Grand Art.

210
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,130
And with it, we lived 
in the lap of luxury.

211
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,390
But then, at some point, the art was sealed away

212
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:09,700
and became something 
forbidden to touch upon.

213
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,760
Those who set their hand to it 
were made outcasts

214
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,130
and were unable to 
return to their homeland.

215
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,590
The Grand Art allowed one to 
alter the form of all things at will.

216
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:25,760
This act was said to be in 
defiance of God's teachings.

217
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,590
Then the Grand Art is alchemy?

218
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,070
Ridiculous! That's not possible!

219
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,020
There's no way that Ishbalans,

220
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:39,730
who live in the desert and have no 
mechanical civilization, could have alchemy.

221
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,800
Is that what you're thinking?

222
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,360
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

223
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,700
When someone's skin and eye color are different,

224
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,250
not thinking that they could be 
the same as you are goes both ways.

225
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:00,530
Would you mind telling us about how to produce a Philosopher's Stone as well?

226
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,830
I doubt that the theory 
that you have arrived at

227
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,960
and our own ancient art are all that different.

228
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,730
All that remains is the number of humans sacrificed.

229
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,730
Human... sacrifice?

230
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,070
A city, or a nation...

231
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:25,400
When they fall, there is resentment and blood

232
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,080
of tens or hundreds of thousands of people, as they die mortified.

233
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:36,290
When they are taken into 
the body of a superior practitioner,

234
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,630
a Philosopher's Stone is produced.

235
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,750
That's just an overblown version of 
the way that we know how to make one.

236
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,800
It's not the one 
we're hoping to learn.

237
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,300
So, what about Scar-san?

238
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,520
He said he was going to make a Philosopher's Stone.

239
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,810
Why did you teach 
my brother about this?!

240
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,660
My brother only wanted to bring the woman he loved back to life.

241
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,040
But in order for that to happen,

242
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,110
the Ishbalan people would have to be destroyed, and their lives offered in sacrifice.

243
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,370
When my brother realized this, 
he blamed himself.

244
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,390
He said it was as though 
he were the one

245
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,840
who had summoned the disasters that had beset Ishbal!

246
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,670
Here he is!

247
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,670
In here!

248
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,840
You can't! 
Not with that many of them!

249
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,850
Is this scene to repeat itself 
over and over?

250
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,990
Will the people of Ishbal 
ever obtain eternal peace?

251
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:44,030
If I can obtain a power 
beyond theirs...

252
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,770
the Philosopher's Stone...

253
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,860
You would become an outcast?

254
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,270
I already <i>am</i> an outcast.

255
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,500
There are tens of thousands of lives 
dwelling within this arm.

256
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,400
An outcast?

257
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,440
A defiled person?

258
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,220
Rick!

259
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,850
<i>"Those who receive pain can still sleep."</i>

260
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,430
<i>"Those who give pain cannot sleep."</i>

261
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,700
In that case, as of today, 
I shall not sleep.

262
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,690
Go ahead! Go anyplace else but here, you outcast!

263
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,700
You're sure... 
they were named Rockbell?

264
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,810
That's right.

265
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,630
There was a lady doctor

266
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:43,070
who was scary when she got mad but used to give us candy a lot.

267
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,210
They would treat anyone, 
even Ishbalans.

268
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,830
Mom said it was awful 
that they got killed.

269
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,220
You say they were killed by a State Alchemist?

270
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,480
They say he was an alchemist who used flame.

271
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,840
He got a commendation for it.

272
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,730
Mom cried over it, huh?

273
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,440
M-Miss!

274
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,440
The wounds didn't have 
any burns around them?

275
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,710
No. What's more, 
if they had been bullet wounds,

276
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:16,830
the entry wounds should be larger than the exit wounds, but they aren't.

277
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,240
Brother, these are...

278
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,080
There's a lieutenant colonel in Central named Archer, right?

279
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,160
He's going after these guys that are called homunculi.

280
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,420
Homunculi?

281
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,560
One of them is a monster that can quickly extend her fingers, like thin spears,

282
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,440
and then quickly retract them back to normal.

283
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,180
The thickness is about right.

284
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,430
Lt. Col. Archer or Major Armstrong would believe this.

285
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,930
It wasn't an Ishbalan.

286
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:46,060
I can't very well ignore the word of 
an esteemed State Alchemist, huh?

287
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,060
Hey, come on!

288
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,750
Yow-ow-ow!

289
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,830
Winry?

290
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:58,850
Rick, Leo, I managed to get them to overlook anything you might have done.

291
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:03,160
What's more, the people who are 
being held here will not be punished.

292
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,790
They are going to be 
sent to the camp, though.

293
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,670
If you guys want, you can go live in Resembool.

294
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,300
No, we'll go to the camp.

295
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,740
I see.

296
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,000
Where are you two going?

297
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,800
We're going to go after Scar.

298
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,810
If we don't, something terrible is going to happen.

299
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,810
Will you kill him?

300
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,830
Why would I?

301
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,810
Because he's an outcast!

302
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,020
He's defiled! That's why!

303
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,680
We want to stop him.

304
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,920
After all, we're alchemists, 
just like he is.

305
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,380
No, we're human.

306
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,530
We won't kill anyone, and we don't want to let him kill anyone.

307
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:43,290
You're lying! 
You hate Ishbalans!

308
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,530
Does this scare you?

309
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,050
Not even a little!

310
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:06,130
Well... I'm a little bit 
afraid of your red eyes.

311
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:11,680
The first time I met Scar, he was 
the first Ishbalan I had ever seen,

312
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,620
so I was more afraid of him.

313
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,070
Still,

314
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,280
there are times when 
our feelings are wrong.

315
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:24,650
What your mother and father told you isn't necessarily completely true.

316
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,160
That's why...

317
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,920
we all have to find our own answers for ourselves.

318
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,070
One step at a time.

319
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,930
Winry, listen...

320
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,210
That being the case—

321
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:43,050
I'm going to Central.

322
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,640
Hawkeye-san, could you take me with you?

323
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,200
It's been so long, and I'd like to see Hughes-san and Elicia-chan.

324
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:50,650
Sure.

325
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,650
Winry, has something happened?

326
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,770
Well then, first up is Ishbal.

327
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:07,110
I sure hope Scar-san hasn't 
made his Philosopher's Stone.

328
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,870
Yeah.

329
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,210
It sounds so strange, 
us hoping for such a thing.

330
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,260
What does this switch do?

331
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,390
Lieutenant...

332
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,010
Riza is fine.

333
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,900
Riza-san, have you ever shot anyone?

334
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,810
Yes, I have. Many times.

335
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,070
Did you know any doctors by the name of Rockbell?

336
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:41,490
Yes.

337
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,820
I'm not sure what you know,

338
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:51,440
but there are times when a soldier has 
no choice but to take another person's life.

339
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,000
Even when they're following orders that are irrational.

340
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,260
Maybe that's why I don't like soldiers very much.

341
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,760
But you're in the military.

342
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,090
That's because there is 
someone I need to protect.

343
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,600
That is the one thing that 
nobody has forced me to do.

344
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,640
It's something I decided myself.

345
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,100
I pull this trigger of my own will, 
for the sake of the one I need to protect.

346
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,780
Until the day when 
that person achieves his goal,

347
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,480
I will not hesitate 
to pull this trigger.

348
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,570
What if that person 
was not worth protecting?

349
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,570
That is something else 
for me to decide.

350
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,330
This boy is Wrath. 
He is the seventh.

351
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,690
Wrath?

352
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,540
Nice to meet you, Wrath.

353
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,600
I want you to go after the 
Fullmetal brothers once again.

354
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,050
Didn't you tell us that there was little hope of making them create a Philosopher's Stone?

355
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,060
The two of them 
are heading for Ishbal.

356
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,140
I see.

357
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,520
If those boys learn the facts about what happened there,

358
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,510
they will never think again about making a Philosopher's Stone.

359
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,820
That will make it harder for us to move from here on as well.

360
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,570
Then can I eat them?

361
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:08,580
Maybe. Depending on the circumstances, it might be quicker to dispose of them.

362
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,100
I'm sorry. I didn't know anything about this.

363
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,220
"I'm going to push him all the way to the top."

364
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,960
That's what he 
always used to say.

365
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,920
He was sure he was going to make Mustang-san the Führer.

366
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,730
This can't be...

367
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,020
I suppose he did 
help out to that end.

368
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,250
This can't be...

369
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,580
This can't be...

370
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
On the day you left,

371
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
On the day you left,

372
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330

373
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
kimi ga tabidatsu hi wa

374
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,620
I said good-bye and waved, like always

375
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,620
I said good-bye and waved, like always

376
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,620
itsumo to onaji 'jaa ne' to te o futta

377
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,620
itsumo to onaji 'jaa ne' to te o futta

378
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840
Almost as if I would see you again

379
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840
Almost as if I would see you again

380
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840

381
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840

383
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,980

394

395
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:46,750
is to not give up on yourself

396

And until the day my dream comes true,

399
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:53,780
And until the day my dream comes true,

400
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:53,780

401
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:53,780

403

I will be here with a smile as I look up at the stars,
