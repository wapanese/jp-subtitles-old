1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:06,850
Agent of God, you say? In that case, try passing judgment upon me.

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,500
For I am the Strong Arm Alchemist,

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,740
Alex Louis Armstrong!

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,680
Allow me to show you 
the artistic alchemy

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,080
that has been passed down among 
the Armstrong family for generations!

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,790
Another shot!

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,860
The opposite of destruction is creation.

8
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,270
The opposite of creation is destruction.

9
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,100
Destroy and create.

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,210
This is the law of the universe!

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,990
I'll deal with you after I kill Fullmetal and Crystal.

12
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,480
A combination of physical strength and alchemy, huh?

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,620
This could be trouble.

14
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,670
Brown skin and red eyes...

15
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,480
Hold it!

16
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,880
The god of your people strictly forbids alchemy, does he not?

17
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,140
The transmutation process of alchemy 
can be broadly divided into comprehension,

18
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,940
decomposition, and reconstruction.

19
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,810
You stop your transmutation process at the second one, decomposition.

20
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,710
It is still unmistakably alchemy.

21
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,280
I do only as this arm instructs me to.

22
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,040
Even if it is contrary to God's will!

23
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,760
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

24
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,360
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

25
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,390
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

26
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:15,480
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

27
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,130
Ready, steady, can't hold me back

28
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,480
Ready, steady, give me good luck

29
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,780
Ready, steady, never look back

30
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,180
Let's get started, ready, steady, go!

31
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,330
The landscape blows on by me

32
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,330

Please, trust me!

69
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,000
The Ishbal Massacre

70
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,000
The Ishbal Massacre

71
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,430
Brother, now what do we do?

72
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,030
Whatever we do, I'd like to stay as far away as possible from that guy in the sunglasses.

73
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,710
Marcoh-san!

74
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,790
Excuse me, do you have a back door?

75
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,100
We're not going back to the Eastern Command Center?

76
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,180
Since Brigadier General Grand showed up,

77
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,900
it could mean that there are reasons keeping even the Colonel from protecting Doctor Marcoh.

78
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,990
That's right.

79
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,980
To make matters worse, there are all those people from Central here now as well.

80
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,890
There are other people 
here from Central?!

81
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,700
The Führer and his entourage.

82
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,360
To catch me?!

83
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,730
No, that's not why.

84
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,030
Okay, okay, here we go!

85
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,350
Hold on! Hold on! 
Hey, hold on!

86
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,510
Okay, I'm gonna get you!

87
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,460
I've had enough.

88
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,630
I don't care if I do 
get killed by that man.

89
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,180
He has the right to do so.

90
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,430
Colonel! We found him!

91
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,050
Major!

92
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,900
Hey, Major! What happened?!

93
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,570
Whoa!

94
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,030
That was close...

95
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,570
This is intense.

96
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,690
Lt. Colonel, what about Brig. Gen. Grand?

97
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,700
If he's alive after that, 
then the Iron Blood Alchemist

98
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,670
can come back to life after 
being turned into hamburger.

99
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,760
But he was an expert in military hand-to-hand combat, right?

100
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,930
It was Scar, without a doubt.

101
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,860
He's...

102
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,740
He's an Ishbalan.

103
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,740
Major, don't get up!

104
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,850
I'm terribly sorry I could not 
carry out your orders, Lt. Colonel.

105
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,550
I saw him... his skin... his eyes...

106
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,580
Those are definitely the traits of the Ishbalan people.

107
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,330
I see. So that's why he's going after State Alchemists.

108
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,650
If he's of the Ishbalan people, 
then why do you have to be killed by him?

109
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,950
The Ishbalans instigated 
a war of independence, right?

110
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:03,030
There were a lot of them who died, 
but the military also suffered many casualties.

111
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:10,640
If everyone who ever lost in a war 
swore revenge, there'd be no end to it.

112
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,490
That was no war.

113
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,410
It was a massacre.

114
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,300
The people of Ishbal were 
a tribe in the Eastern Region

115
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,630
who believed in Ishbala 
as the one and only creator.

116
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,720
They held religious values 
that were different from ours.

117
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,470
We think of the world's composition

118
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,470
as something which can be mathematically determined

119
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,690
and have high regard for the 
equivalent exchange of alchemy.

120
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,570
But the Ishbalans thought of alchemy as the work of the devil,

121
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:48,560
which perverts the world 
that was given to us by God.

122
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,880
As a result, there were resistance movements that sprang up from time to time.

123
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,950
And then, thirteen years ago...

124
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,160
Hey, what do you think you're doing?!

125
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,010
...while an officer was 
conducting an inspection,

126
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,670
he accidentally shot a child.

127
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:15,680
That incident lead to the outbreak of large-scale uprisings and riots.

128
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,810
Before long, the rebellion had spread throughout the whole Eastern Region

129
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,110
and had become a war 
that lasted seven years.

130
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,930
Then, in the final days of fighting...

131
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,670
the higher-ups decided to employ State Alchemists.

132
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,210
Why?!

133
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:49,550
Because of their doctrines, the Ishbalans have neither alchemy nor up-to-date weapons!

134
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,060
What do you hope to obtain by further antagonizing them?!

135
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,300
Have you brought them?

136
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,180
They're still under research.

137
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,390
Besides, there's no need to use them.

138
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,390
As a matter of fact, 
the rebellion is steadily spreading.

139
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,140
That's because you're trying to keep them down by force,

140
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,400
and so, more and more tribes are cooperating with the enemy.

141
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,240
Are you saying that what 
the Führer is doing is wrong?

142
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,360
We already have several thousand soldiers

143
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,500
and several tens of thousands of civilians who have become casualties.

144
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,380
This is war.

145
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,250
Crystal Alchemist, let me see them.

146
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,180
In order to hasten the end 
of this war, as of tomorrow,

147
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,090
I'm authorizing the use of 
alchemic augmentation agents!

148
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,930
So, then what happened?

149
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,570
Nothing.

150
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,960
Nothing?

151
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,890
For every battlefield 
the State Alchemists were dispatched to,

152
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,310
it was all over in one night.

153
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,340
There he is!

154
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,370
Over here!

155
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,450
Yow!

156
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,450
Ow!

157
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,960
Let me see.

158
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,960
On the battlefield, 
I came across this couple.

159
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,360
They were doctors,

160
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,810
and would treat people, regardless of 
whether they were friend or foe.

161
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,840
How's that?

162
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,450
Thanks!

163
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,780
That was incredible, huh?

164
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,860
However, they died.

165
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,370
Colonel Grand, what's going on?!

166
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:11,230
This place has become a contact point for Ishbalan refugees.

167
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,560
The doctors were 
in cahoots with them.

168
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,590
They just wanted to save as many lives as they could, that's all!

169
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,840
The lives they save 
are killing my men.

170
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,150
Stop that.

171
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,010
You were just following orders.

172
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,450
The sin is upon me.

173
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:52,160
As fellow doctors, they saved lives...

174
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,660
whereas I...

175
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,290
What do I do?

176
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,260
Would you keep quiet and let me run away?

177
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,820
And so, I left with 
the Philosopher's Stones

178
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,060
and all of the materials 
relating to them.

179
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,040
But it was too late.

180
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,660
The people of Ishbal 
had been exterminated.

181
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,690
I heard that there were only a handful of survivors.

182
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,620
Even so, that's no reason for you to be killed!

183
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,500
He has a legitimate reason 
for his revenge.

184
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,080
How can there be any legitimacy to his revenge

185
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,950
when he drags people who aren't involved into it?

186
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,330
What he's doing...

187
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:37,140
is wrapping his ugly lust for vengeance up inside a claim of being God's agent

188
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,890
and acting like 
it's all noble. That's all.

189
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,840
Still...

190
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,950
Brother, if you had been...

191
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,690
I would do the same thing.

192
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,780
That's the Principle of 
Equivalent Exchange, right?

193
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,160
No!

194
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,750
Taking revenge won't ever bring anything back!

195
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,280
All you'd need to do is live.

196
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,520
Live... Live, and find happiness.

197
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,160
Here.

198
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,400
Marcoh-san,

199
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,690
why don't you come 
hide in our hometown?

200
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,650
It won't even take three days by train to get there. Right?

201
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,340
It'll be a little hard on us going back, though.

202
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,940
There's a house there, where an Automail craftswoman named Rockbell lives.

203
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,430
I'm sure they'd let us...

204
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,740
Rockbell...

205
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,350
I can't go there... Not me...

206
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,130
Marcoh-san!

207
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,880
What foolishness!

208
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,220
You would rely upon weapons that have been enhanced by the curse of alchemy?

209
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:52,990
In that case...!

210
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,740
That's far enough.

211
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,880
Colonel Mustang!

212
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,610
Mustang?

213
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,220
The State Alchemist?

214
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,330
Indeed I am.

215
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,590
Colonel!

216
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,720
I am the Flame Alchemist, 
Roy Mustang.

217
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:21,260
Yet another who deviates from the path of God?

218
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,900
You would still challenge me to battle, knowing that I am the Flame Alchemist?

219
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,770
Colonel!

220
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,450
Colonel!

221
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,820
Why'd you do that 
all of a sudden?!

222
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,120
You're good for nothing on rainy days, so please stay back, Colonel!

223
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,380
You can't make sparks 
when it's this damp, huh?

224
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,130
Fire!

225
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,730
He sure is fast.

226
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,850
After him!

227
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,480
Lt. Breda, you wait for Fullmetal at the train station.

228
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,810
Why would Ed be going to the train station?

229
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,330
It's obvious that he's thinking about getting Marcoh out of here.

230
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,740
Marcoh-san!

231
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,230
Wait up!

232
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,080
We aren't going to take your research from you by force.

233
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,830
No! I can't go!

234
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,100
This time, I know that you are just a hollow suit of armor!

235
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,850
Al!

236
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,050
By joining your hands together, you create a ring

237
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,380
and then transmute with 
power that circulates within.

238
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,960
Without this miserable right hand, you cannot transmute.

239
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,050
I will have to destroy it.

240
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,880
Brother!

241
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,230
Brother, run! Brother!

242
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,980
Brother!

243
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,200
I will give you a moment 
to pray to God.

244
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,610
Unfortunately, 
I've stopped believing in God.

245
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,910
You said your older brother died in Ishbal, right?

246
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:46,790
He was killed... 
by a State Alchemist.

247
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,670
I'm an older brother too.

248
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,920
Kill me. It'll be an equivalent exchange.

249
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,900
What are you talking about, Brother?!

250
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,010
You said yourself that it wouldn't be an equivalent exchange, didn't you?!

251
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,510
He's not a State Alchemist!

252
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,520
I should be enough alone, right?

253
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,580
I promise you, I will not go after your brother.

254
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,250
However, you are wrong, Fullmetal Alchemist.

255
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,060
There is nothing that can be equivalently exchanged

256
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,490
for the despair over losing 
your brother and your people.

257
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,490
If not, then what is 
your vengeance for?

258
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,220
Brother! What are you doing?! Get out of there!

259
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,080
Get up and run!

260
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,530
Get out of there!

261
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,260
Stop!

262
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,760
Please stop!

263
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,610
Marcoh-san...

264
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,310
You dumb bastard, 
haven't you run away?!

265
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,990
I investigated some ancient records once in Ishbal.

266
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:59,570
In them, I saw the design 
you have drawn on your right arm.

267
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,240
This may be a dud, but it is still a Philosopher's Stone.

268
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,120
And sure enough, your arm is...

269
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,500
Stop! Don't say it!

270
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,290
What's going on?

271
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,510
Marcoh-san, is this different from when you were using the Stone's power?

272
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,160
The sewers, huh?

273
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,780
Don't go after him.

274
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,780
I'm not going to!

275
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,000
Yo!

276
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,140
Is it over?

277
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,900
As long as you're here, 
you could at least help us out!

278
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,100
Lay off!

279
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:02,510
Don't go dragging a normal person like me into you ridiculous folks' freak show!

280
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:10,510
Lt. Hawkeye, take crowd control. Don't let anyone come near.

281
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,730
Right!

282
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,480
Al, are you all right?

283
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,480
You...

284
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,680
stupid brother!

285
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,480
What was that for?!

286
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,890
Why didn't you leave me 
and run away?!

287
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,970
But then you would've been killed!

288
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,580
So you decide to go and die instead? You idiot!

289
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,750
Don't you call your 
older brother an idiot!

290
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,830
I'll call you that 
as often as I want!

291
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,880
Live on, live on, survive,

292
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,480
and research more alchemy,

293
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,350
so that one day, 
we'll get our bodies back.

294
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,880
Dying... Dying by yourself...

295
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,430
is one thing that 
I absolutely will not allow!

296
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,810
Look, now my arm has 
broken off, you moron!

297
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,610
We're falling apart, aren't we?

298
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,780
We must look just terrible.

299
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,280
But we're alive.

300
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,800
Uh-huh, alive...

301
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,620
That suit of armor...

302
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,940
I've never heard of 
a soul transmutation.

303
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,440
He must've risked his life to take on that transmutation.

304
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,040
That's why the bond between 
those two brothers is so strong.

305
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,050
Colonel...

306
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,350
It's the Führer's secretary.

307
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,530
The Führer's secretary?

308
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,000
The Führer says that we will be taking custody of Marcoh

309
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,220
and that he will not 
come to harm.

310
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,930
But...

311
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,930
Very well.

312
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,980
Marcoh-san!

313
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,680
It's like I told you, Edward-kun.

314
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,300
I cannot go to your hometown.

315
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,720
Why not?

316
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,860
The doctor couple who died on the battlefield...

317
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,740
Their names were Rockbell.

318
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,710
Let's be going.

319
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,270
Brother,

320
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,550
I just heard Mom's voice.

321
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,980
Dummy, you just had a brush with death. Don't start having unstable dreams, now.

322
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,850
You squeeze your right hand, as if to reassure yourself

323
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,850
tashikameru you ni nigirishimeta migite

324
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,700
Go on, take those annoying rules and dash them away!

325
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,700
uzattai housoku o buchikowashite yuke

326
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,840
If it comes down to having to rest your wounded feet,

327
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,840
kizutsuita ashi o yasumaseru gurai nara

328
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,730
you've gotta keep moving forward, if only just a step!

329
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,730
tatta ippo demo koko kara susume

330
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,500
We've pushed our way

331
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,500
through the twisting winds

332
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,500
yuganda kaze o kaki wakete

333
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,630
and gotten beyond the cold sky

334
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,630

335
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,400

00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,570

339
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:11,910
Just continuing to believe is not the answer

shinji tsuzukeru dake ga kotae janai

341
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,620
We must bare our weaknesses and wounds,

yowasa mo kizu mo sarake dashite

343
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,300
and continue to struggle,

344
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,300
or nothing will ever turn out!

345
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,300

00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:29,000

348
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,600
To the other side of the door!

That Which Is Lost

352
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,910
That Which Is Lost

353
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,980

Episode 16: "That Which Is Lost"

355
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,650
Brother's arm and leg...

356
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,360
My body...

357
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,240
In exchange for having lost them,

358
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,990
have we obtained anything?
