1
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,730
Did you arrange for him too, Mason-san?

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,120
The only time I frightened you 
was three years ago.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,870
We couldn't have you dying out here, 
so I came to keep watch.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,070
Then why did you attack us?!

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,780
That was because Izumi-san 
told me to toughen you up a little.

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,080
You've got to be kidding!

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,570
That wasn't "a little," 
we were at death's door!

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,210
That's right! How could you have been so reckless with children?

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,250
Enough! Stop griping about 
something that happened ages ago!

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,840
We're sorry!

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:32,840
Sensei?

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,740
He's just a child.

13
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,000
He probably just stole his parents' boat or something and drifted here.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,930
If that's the caseâ€”

15
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,310
Sensei!

16
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,460
Brother! That light!

17
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,100
He's an alchemist!

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,610
Ed!

19
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,520
Why, you...

20
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,590
You turned your 
own body into stone?

21
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,130
Wh-What's with this guy?! 
Where are his clothes?!

22
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,140
What are you doing?! 
He's just a child, you know!

23
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,790
But he might have been 
coming after us.

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,980
Coming after you?

25
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,450
At your ages, are you already such wanted men?

26
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,070
I'm not kidding around.

27
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,320
Where did you come from? Where are your parents?

28
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,340
I don't know.

29
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,960
What's your name?

30
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't know.

31
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,210
I don't know anything...

32
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,540
There, there, 
you don't have to cry.

33
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,240
You're all right now.

34
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,870
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

35
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,480
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

36
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,510
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

37
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,980
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

38
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:39,650
Far away, far away, our dreams will never fade

39
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:39,650
tooku tooku omoi hatenaku

40
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,950
If only the two of us could go back to

41
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,950
futari ga mujaki ni waratteta

42
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,800
the days when we laughed so innocently

43
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,800
ano koro ni modoreru nara

44
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,900
the days when we laughed so innocently

45
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,900
ano koro ni modoreru nara

46
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,730
Just like glassware

47
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,730
konagona ni kudaketa

48
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,330
that has been smashed to pieces,

49
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,330
glass-zaiku no you na

50
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:10,120
we're putting together the fragments of our memories

51
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:10,120
omoide no kakera o atsumeteru

52
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,910
It's the important things that you notice

53
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,910
daiji na mono wa itsudatte

54
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,730
It's the important things that you notice

55
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,730
daiji na mono wa itsudatte

56
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:21,480
once you've lost them

57
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:21,480
nakushite kara kizuku yo

58
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,730
Oh, please, oh, please, stop time for me,

00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,730
douka douka jikan o tomete

60
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:34,310
and engrave the way you look right now into my heart

61
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:34,310
kimi no omokage o kono mune ni kizandekure

62
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:39,860
And if, and if, I were ever allowed to,

00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:39,860
moshimo moshimo yurusareru nara

64
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,270
I would be willing to sacrifice everything

65
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,270
subete o gisei ni shitemo ii

66
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:48,920
just to see that smiling face one more time

67
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:48,920
ano egao o mou ichido

68
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,010
The Untainted Child

69
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,010
The Untainted Child

70
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,700
Those haven't been cooked yet.

71
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,750
Still, I'm glad that you two made it back alive.

72
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,540
Don't go killing us off so easily.

73
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,490
So? Has your teacher forgiven you?

74
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,250
That's probably going to be difficult.

75
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,800
We disobeyed what she taught us.

76
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,770
Even though we knew we were nothing more than one part of the flow of the world,

77
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,000
we became conceited, saying that the world was within us, too,

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,810
and tried to alter that flow.

79
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,890
That's something 
she'll never forgive us for.

80
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,060
Shoot! Let go of me! Come on!

81
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,150
Let go of me!

82
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,850
Take it easy on me!

83
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,160
There's something funny about that!

84
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,960
Everybody makes mistakes, don't they? 
I'm going to go tell her off!

85
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,840
I'll ask her if she's never 
made any mistakes before.

86
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,670
Hold on, Winry! That's all right!

87
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,430
Sensei realizes that much.

88
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,470
So don't worry, Winry.

89
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,090
I suppose...

90
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,860
So, what are you going to do?

91
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,230
Hmm, I'm not sure...

92
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:44,990
About that boy?

93
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,490
Even if he has lost his memory,

94
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,250
Sensei trusts him too much.

95
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,630
But she did take him 
to the police, right?

96
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,100
They asked her to watch after him while they gathered information.

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,580
I hope he's just a lost little boy.

98
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,470
The meat is too tough!

99
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,730
We'd better not do this, Brother.

100
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,640
Sensei locked it with alchemy. If we open it, she'll know.

101
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,740
In that case...

102
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,190
Al, make sure to put this back the way it was.

103
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:43,960
Wanna play?

104
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,420
Terrific! Everyone was dead, 
so it got boring.

105
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,430
They aren't dead. 
They're just asleep.

106
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,740
What should we play? I know!

107
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,020
Look! You played around like this, huh?

108
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:11,070
So, it <i>was</i> you who watched us 
that whole time, huh?

109
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,760
Where did you come from?

110
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,250
Hey, let it go!

111
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,170
No!

112
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,670
An animal's life is not a plaything.

113
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,790
I'm playing! I'm playing! I'm playing!

114
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,130
H-Hey, be quiet! You'll wake them up!

115
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,380
Ah, dammit!

116
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,750
Incredible! Incredible!

117
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,110
You can do that too, right?

118
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,750
Don't lie to me! Earlier on the island, 
you transmuted a rock!

119
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,090
Your clothes were also made by transmutation, right?

120
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,820
Brother, your tone...

121
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
Al, you saw it, didn't you?

122
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,190
This guy transmuted without using a transmutation circle.

123
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,000
The only ones who can do that are myself and Sensei.

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,570
And yet, Sensei pretended like she didn't see anything.

125
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,900
That's definitely weird.

126
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,000
What's the matter?

127
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,060
Try untying it with alchemy.

128
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,840
Take it off, take it off, take it off!

129
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,960
Brother, this boy really doesn't have anything to do with those others.

130
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,680
Al, I remember having seen his face before.

131
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,340
It's as though I've 
seen him somewhere...

132
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,860
Brother! What'd you do?!

133
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,230
I didn't do anything!

134
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:42,330
There's no way I could transmute a person's body and a bed together in the first place!

135
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,500
You're making too much noise for me to sleep!

136
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,670
Hey...

137
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,340
No, no, no, no!

138
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,480
It wasn't like that, Sensei! We didn't do anything!

139
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,500
It's true! Brother is quite the liar, but he's telling the truth today!

140
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,370
Al, thanks a lot...

141
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,640
I know. I don't remember having taught you 
any such careless alchemy as this.

142
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,910
Making Chimeras by crossing two lives with each other aside, that is...

143
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,320
Let me down! Let me down from here!

144
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,030
Stop crying!

145
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,580
It's all right.

146
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,000
Can you remember what your original form was?

147
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,550
You just have to remember 
what your original form was.

148
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,090
Take your time... Take your time...

149
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,020
You moronic pupils!

150
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,470
What kind of commotion were you 
trying to create by scaring this child?!

151
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,760
We're sorry, Sensei!

152
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,880
But we were worried.

153
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,740
What if he was the guy 
who came after us?

154
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,250
Just who is it that's after you?

155
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,250
They called themselves... homunculi.

156
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,310
Thank you for always 
coming by like this.

157
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,920
But with your new job, are you sure it's okay?

158
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,840
Yes. I work at home, 
so my time is free.

159
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:41,190
Scieszka-san, um, if you're still investigating the incident with Maes...

160
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,790
It's all right. I'm not involved in 
anything that dangerous.

161
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,760
I'm not all that impulsive, after all.

162
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,060
Bye-bye.

163
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,060
Bye-bye.

164
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,370
Well, if you'll excuse me...

165
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,040
See you tomorrow, okay?

166
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,830
Hold on! Just a minute!

167
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,470
Colonel...

168
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,620
Ow-ow-ow-ow...

169
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,350
Aren't you going to Hughes-san's house?

170
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,570
Is it wrong of me to slip over to a close friend's home?

171
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,760
There's no way you can 
show your face there, huh?

172
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,720
Not when you aren't even investigating the cause of that close friend's death

173
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,580
and can only think about 
getting yourself promoted.

174
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,660
Now look, missy...

175
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,150
These are copies of the materials

176
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,330
that Hughes-san was looking into 
right before he died.

177
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,320
The reason that he was killed 
has to be in there somewhere.

178
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,260
Congratulations on your posting to Central!

179
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,280
That was easy for me to say, but I don't get this at all!

180
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:59,990
This is a list of all the external calls that were connected to the Central Command Center.

181
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,580
There's no sort of code here...

182
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,740
To the reception clerk... 
To the Ministry of Justice...

183
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,770
To the FÃ¼hrer's secretary's office...

184
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,220
I don't get it!

185
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,960
I can't have you lose 
track of them, you know.

186
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,880
I'm pretty busy myself here, after all.

187
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,970
Their master lives in 
a town named Dublith.

188
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,770
They might still be there.

189
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,810
Maybe I should go there 
and have a look.

190
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,730
It'll be okay to leave the Greed matter to Lust and Gluttony, right?

191
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,010
Yes.

192
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,360
Those boys still haven't given up on the Philosopher's Stone yet.

193
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,630
Arrange for them to have the opportunity to create one once again.

194
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,950
For being the youngest among us, 
you sure do give orders like you're all grown up.

195
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,340
I would like to have those boys create a Philosopher's Stone,

196
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:54,460
but we can't have them sticking their noses into that Ishbal business. Understood?

197
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,840
Why don't those homunculi create their own Philosopher's Stone?

198
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,670
They said that they couldn't make it themselvesâ€”

199
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,600
that they couldn't use alchemy.

200
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,100
In that case, this child is different.

201
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,160
That is true.

202
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,210
But you shouldn't be able to reform your own body,

203
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:21,060
no matter what kind of alchemy you're using, and yet he can.

204
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,610
What's more, he has transmuted without a transmutation circle

205
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,400
just like you and Brother do.

206
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:26,950
That'sâ€”

207
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,460
Al! Not that...

208
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,290
Al, don't you remember?

209
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,670
Remember what?

210
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,830
Ed, you remember, don't you?

211
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,590
The gateway, you mean?

212
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,060
Sure enough, 
it's because I saw it...

213
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,020
It was truth, wasn't it?

214
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,070
Truth?

215
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,510
Brother! Brother!

216
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,980
Al!

217
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,520
At the time, I couldn't understand what was going on.

218
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,480
It was as if there was this incredible amount of information being directly mashed into my brain.

219
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,380
But then, suddenly I understood.

220
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,080
Everything about alchemy that I hadn't known up until then...

221
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,310
It felt like I was just 
one step away from arriving

222
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,390
at my imperfect theory of human transmutation.

223
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,170
Mom!

224
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,240
Stop it! Let me go!

225
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,240
Please let me go!

226
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:01,960
Hold on!

227
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,590
One more time! 
Show it to me one more time!

228
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:08,150
The truth was in there! 
The thing that I've been looking for!

229
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,990
Equivalent exchange? 
What do you mean?

230
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,330
A toll?

231
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,330
Dammit!

232
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,110
He's been taken away!

233
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,900
Mom?

234
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,620
No... This isn't what I wanted...

235
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,630
Al, it's all my fault... Mine!

236
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,350
I understood when I was inside that gateway.

237
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,390
If I acted now, there was still time. If I acted now, I could still...

238
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,470
Give him back. He's my brother.

239
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,970
My leg...

240
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,980
Both my arms... My heart... I'll give them to you...

241
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:08,940
Just give him back! 
He's my only brother!

242
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,740
Al!

243
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,410
Al!

244
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,110
Al!

245
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:36,030
By the time I came to, 
I was already in this body,

246
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:39,390
and what had been Mom was no longer there.

247
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:44,480
I saw the truth there. That's why I can transmute without a transmutation circle

248
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,950
and was able to bond Al's soul.

249
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,150
Isn't that right?

250
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,670
You think of it as truth, do you?

251
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,270
Well, it is, isn't it? I...

252
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,650
It was more along the lines of a magic trick, wasn't it?

253
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:05,680
Sensei, I just remembered. 
I have a hunch that I saw him there.

254
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,380
If that's so, then he isn't human!

255
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,150
He's something else!

256
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,160
There's something I need to check. Everything else comes afterward.

257
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,880
Sensei!

258
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,050
I forbid you to go near 
that child. Got that?

259
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:20,930
Izumi...

260
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,210
It's all right.

261
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,390
I'm just going to go make sure.

262
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,750
Please, let me go alone.

263
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:33,300
Those boys don't know, do they? How homunculi are born.

264
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,620
Gentlemen! 
How good of you to come!

265
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:47,620
I, Alex Louis Armstrong, 
welcome you with my utmost!

266
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,750
Stop fooling around 
and get to work!

267
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,970
Lieutenant Breda...

268
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,220
Still, you never know when he's 
going to strike. Brace yourselves.

269
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,310
The major isn't here.

270
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,310
Oh, is that right?

271
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,620
He's with the officer assigned to the Court-Martial Office

272
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,790
who has taken over for 
Brigadier General Hughes,

273
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,820
and they're off conducting 
an investigation somewhere.

274
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,070
Who is this other person 
who's taking over for him?

275
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,890
As I recall, it was Frank...

276
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,070
You mean Lt. Colonel Frank Archer?

277
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,210
Do you know him?

278
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,460
He's a man dedicated to his military duties.

279
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,580
That's a good thing to be, isn't it?

280
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,460
By military duties, 
I mean that the man enjoys war.

281
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,820
Lt. Colonel, 
I'm sorry to ask you again...

282
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,250
I don't know where the Elric brothers went. What are you, a broken record?

283
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,350
There's no evidence that they even went south.

284
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,620
It is evident that they went south.

285
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,670
You have someone watching them? Those brothers are not traitors!

286
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,990
Perhaps.

287
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:01,870
I just don't have any intention of letting them run around free, the way Mustang does.

288
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,370
For the sake of the forthcoming battle, 
you understand.

289
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,250
Sorry about this,

290
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,350
but Izumi-san told me not to let you out, no matter what.

291
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,850
So, where did she go?

292
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,630
Beats me.

293
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,920
She asked to have a boat ready for her, 
so maybe the island again.

294
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,020
The island? Why?

295
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,560
What are you doing, Al?

296
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,640
Shhh!

297
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,350
All righty...

298
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,050
There, let's let your hair out, okay?

299
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,360
Winry, sorry, but since we can't come out of our room...

300
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,360
Al? What did you guys do to this boy? 
He's terrified of you.

301
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,840
Mm-hmm... Anyhow, Winry, this may sound strange,

302
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,470
but there's something 
I need to ask you.

303
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,080
It's about that boy's body.

304
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,000
Al, what are you talking about?

305
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,580
You mean this? I was surprised too. 
What in the world could have happened?

306
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,210
At the base of his right arm 
and left leg...

307
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,460
Al,

308
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,680
what are you trying to say?

309
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,770
Brother, you said you saw it, right? 
His face, on the other side of the doorway?

310
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,470
What's going on?!

311
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,650
Th-This isn't good. 
If Izumi-san finds out...

312
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,570
We'll be finished right away.

313
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:26,770
You guys! Your teacher told you 
not to come near this boy, didn't she?

314
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,990
Like he said, we'll be 
finished with this right away!

315
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:38,060
There's no way... something like this could be, right?

316
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,920
It was an equivalent exchange...

317
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,930
Mom's body, in exchange for my leg...

318
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,680
Al's soul, as it was fading away, in exchange for my arm...

319
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,180
It was an equivalent exchange!

320
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,410
Where did you get this scar?

321
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,400
It's the scar from a fox bite...

322
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,820
Is this my arm?!

323
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,670
Wait! Ed!

324
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,250
Edward!

325
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,250
Could it be...

326
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,470
Could it be that that boy's arm and leg are...

327
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:14,380
On the day you left,

328
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:14,380
On the day you left,

329
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:14,380
kimi ga tabidatsu hi wa

330
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:14,380
kimi ga tabidatsu hi wa

331
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:21,670
I said good-bye and waved, like always

332
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:21,670
I said good-bye and waved, like always

333
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:21,670
itsumo to onaji 'jaa ne' to te o futta

334
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:21,670
itsumo to onaji 'jaa ne' to te o futta

335
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:27,890
Almost as if I would see you again

336
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:27,890
Almost as if I would see you again

337
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:27,890

338
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:27,890
