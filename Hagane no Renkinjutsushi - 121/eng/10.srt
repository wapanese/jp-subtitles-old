1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,900
Changing two.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,150
<i>Sheesh, more junk?</i>

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,150
Older Brother - 15

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,150
Older Brother - 15

5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,400
Younger Brother - 14

6
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,400
Younger Brother - 14

7
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,980
Stop dawdling around!

8
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,200
Okay, I'll also change two.

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,000
<i>There it is!</i>

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,770
Say, Brother, 
want to double the bet?

11
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:21,910
Suit yourself.

12
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,920
Sorry, but I have a full house.

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,420
Sorry, but I have 
a royal straight flush.

14
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,700
No way! I lose <i>again</i>?!

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,970
All right, this time for sure...

16
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,630
I'm out. This is boring.

17
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,730
What's wrong, Brother? 
You've done nothing but win for a while.

18
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,060
Are you bored from only winning?

19
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,100
It has nothing to do with the cards. 
The problem is...

20
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,770
Colonel Mustang.

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,120
You don't want to see him.

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,480
Of course not!

23
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,490
It turns out that the 
Philosopher's Stone was a fake,

24
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,170
and we haven't produced 
any other results, after all.

25
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,490
That may be true...

26
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,490
Just watch as I give my report.

27
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,050
This is Colonel Mustang 
we're talking about.

28
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,450
The kinds of sarcastic 
things he'll say to me...

29
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,710
Just imagining it 
puts me in a nasty mood.

30
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,880
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

31
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,440
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,500
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

33
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:34,590
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

34
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,000
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

35
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,000
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

36
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,000
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

37
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,000
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,470
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,470
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,470
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,470
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

42
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:47,670
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

43
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:47,670
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

44
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:47,670
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

45
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:47,670
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

46
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,470
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

47
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,470
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

48
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,470
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

49
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:56,510
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

50
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:56,510
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

51
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,470
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

52
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,470
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

53
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,220
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

54
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,220
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

55
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,220

00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,940
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

58
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,940
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

59
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,340
Looking at the sky, 
thinking tomorrow must be coming,

60
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,340
asu ga kuru hazu no sora wo mite

61
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:16,840
it's too much for my captivated heart to take

62
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:16,840
mayou bakari no kokoro mote amashite iru

63
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,590
As a bird flutters along beside me,

64
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,590
katawara no tori ga habataita

65
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:27,690
I wonder where he managed to find his light

66
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:27,690
doko ka hikari wo mitsukerareta no ka na

67
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,590
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

68
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,590
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

69
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,130
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

70
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,130
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

71
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,130
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

72
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,130
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

73
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:38,300
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

74
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:38,300
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

75
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:45,690
And leave me at the highest place there is,

76
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:45,690
And leave me at the highest place there is,

77
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:45,690
soshite ichiban takai tokoro de

78
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:45,690
soshite ichiban takai tokoro de

79
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,580
far away from kindness?

80
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,580
okizari ni shite, yasashisa kara toozakete

81
00:02:49,580 --> 00:03:00,950
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

82
00:02:49,580 --> 00:03:00,950
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,510
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

93
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,970
Psiren, the Phantom Thief

94
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,970
Psiren, the Phantom Thief

95
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,750
Are you sure this is okay, Brother? 
Getting off the train along the way?

96
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,220
We're okay.

97
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,600
You never know where information leading to the Philosopher's Stone might be lying around, after all.

98
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,130
Besides, Aquroya is a famous tourist spot.

99
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,610
It wouldn't hurt to 
have a look at it, right?

100
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,700
It sort of feels like we're playing hooky from school, huh?

101
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,280
Who's playing hooky?!

102
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,870
What's this?! 
Brother, by any chance...

103
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,850
Wait up, Brother!

104
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,710
You cheater! You cheated! Brother, you're a cheater!

105
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,810
After her! Don't let her escape!

106
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,810
Today's the day we catch Psiren!

107
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,550
All right, that's far enough.

108
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,570
You've got nowhere to run, Psiren!

109
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,100
Hey, hold it!

110
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,820
It's a pretty city, isn't it, Brother?

111
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,850
Isn't it?

112
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,980
The City of Water, Aquroya, 
is a famous sightseeing area.

113
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,230
This is far better than going to that dusty East City,

114
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,610
and having to look into that 
cynical face of the Colonel's.

115
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,480
How the hell could you do that?!

116
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,930
It <i>is</i> the City of Water, after all.

117
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,520
What do you want, Pops? Yow!

118
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,910
You're coming to 
the station with me.

119
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,980
There's something 
I want to ask you about.

120
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,590
So, you're a State Alchemist, then?

121
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,870
And the famous Fullmetal one, at that.

122
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,040
How many times are you going to make me say it?

123
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,490
That should be more 
proof than anything!

124
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,540
If it's the real thing, that is.

125
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,770
How a pipsqueak like you could beâ€”

126
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,880
Who are you calling a pee-wee so small 
that you instinctively want to step on him?!

127
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,390
Brother, nobody said anything like that.

128
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,840
Now, now, don't get so worked up.

129
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,250
Right now, we have an unidentified phantom thief in the city

130
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,010
who goes by the name of "Psiren" plaguing us.

131
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,040
Psiren?

132
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,280
We only have one thing 
that you could call a lead.

133
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,250
And that's the fact that Psiren uses alchemy.

134
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,160
You're an alchemist too, right?

135
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,830
That's why I thought I would hear what you have to say.

136
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,420
Damn that guy!

137
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,380
He kept repeating the same questions for three whole hours.

138
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,480
What is he using for brains?

139
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,510
But, Brother, doesn't it bother you? I mean, an alchemist thief...

140
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,320
Well, I...

141
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,270
Brother?

142
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,690
What's wrong?

143
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,730
M-My stomach...

144
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,900
It's some mild food poisoning.

145
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,280
You didn't just eat 
too much, then.

146
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,250
Leave me alone.

147
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,560
Better give you a shot. Clara-kun!

148
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,050
Yes?

149
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,160
A shot?

150
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,910
Yes, a shot.

151
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,570
No way! I hate shots!

152
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,720
Brother! Don't make a scene!

153
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,920
I'm okay! I'm already better!

154
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,360
You're not a child! 
Here, take off your coat!

155
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,050
Stop, Al! Are you trying to 
sell your brother out here?!

156
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,930
You're going to make me mad, Brother!

157
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,320
Aah! I hate shots!

158
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,470
There!

159
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,430
Your shot is all done. 
That didn't hurt, did it?

160
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,050
<i>I-I didn't even notice...</i>

161
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,740
<i>That was incredibly fast work...</i>

162
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,090
Say, listen...

163
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,440
Wh-What?

164
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,940
You need to grow up soon.

165
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,730
M-Mind your own business.

166
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,070
She sure was a pretty nurse, huh?

167
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,620
I unexpectedly found myself fascinated by her.

168
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,260
What kind of taste 
have you got, anyhow?

169
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,240
What's so good about 
a woman like her?

170
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,210
This won't do, ma'am.

171
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,460
You've left so much here.

172
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,220
I'm sorry,

173
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,420
but I just can't get them down.

174
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,970
I can't help you there. Well...

175
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,930
How about I peel another piece of fruit for you?

176
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,290
Are you all right with that?

177
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,250
This is no problem.

178
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,150
That looks dangerous. I'll do it. 
Let me have it, Brother.

179
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,310
I'm okay. Back off!

180
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,450
There...

181
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,880
You two eat.

182
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,360
What are you thinking about?

183
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,720
Nothing. Still...

184
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,580
Clara-san isn't just pretty. 
She's kind, too.

185
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,890
She kind of resembles Mom a little bit.

186
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,640
Don't be ridiculous! 
They're completely different!

187
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,650
I-I'm sorry.

188
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,350
That's okay, ma'am. 
Don't worry about it.

189
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,410
Here.

190
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,990
You two are alchemists?

191
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,520
Elric! Mr. Elric!

192
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,740
Now what, Pops?! 
I'm not a thief!

193
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,420
I know, I know.

194
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,180
The truth is, I have a request.

195
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:03,010
We salute the State Alchemist, Edward Elric-sensei!

196
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,480
Yikes.

197
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,320
What are you up to, Pops?

198
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,240
No, no, no, I'm sorry about earlier. 
As you said, Sensei,

199
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,990
I inquired of Commander Mustang of the Eastern Command Center.

200
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,980
When I did, it turned out that you really are a State Alchemist, Sensei!

201
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,000
My, my, I truly underestimated you!

202
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,630
Isn't that what I said?

203
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,000
I-Indeed.

204
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,080
As it happens, Sensei,
 I have a favor to aâ€”

205
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,250
Another serving.

206
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,760
As many as you'd like.

207
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,510
With Sensei on our side, we can rest assured.

208
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,870
Today is the last day for Psiren.

209
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,310
Well, I'll give it a shot.

210
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,530
Still, though, 
that's an awful lot of people.

211
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:51,020
Yeah. I don't know 
what Psiren is thinking,

212
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,780
sending prior notice to newspapers 
throughout the country of upcoming thefts.

213
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,090
Newspaper reporters, spectators, 
and even Psiren groupies show up as a result.

214
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,750
She's quite popular, huh?

215
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,990
Well, that popularity ends tonight.

216
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,600
We'll leave it in your hands, Sensei.

217
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,000
Now then, I'm going to go 
check on the security situation.

218
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,500
You know, Brother, 
I'm surprised you took on this job.

219
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,510
I've taken an interest...

220
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,010
in this alchemist thief.

221
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,480
Oh, no!

222
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,960
Hold it!

223
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,320
What?

224
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,430
Hold it!

225
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,650
There are many ways 
to use alchemy.

226
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,720
But I won't allow you 
to use it for stealing!

227
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,690
Besides, thanks to you, 
I also got treated like a thief!

228
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,950
Now apologize, 
for all you're worth!

229
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,410
I've caught you!

230
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,700
Y-You're a woman?!

231
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,880
It's a shame I can't 
show you my face.

232
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,530
I'm terribly good-looking.

233
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,890
Dammit, what are you doing?!

234
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,050
Children ought to be in 
bed by now, pipsqueak.

235
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,550
Who are you calling an ultra-hyper-pipsqueak?!

236
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,950
Al... Al!

237
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,710
Where the hell did he go, for crying out loud?

238
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,720
You...

239
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,900
This is a surprise. Who would've thought that the kindly nurse

240
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,500
is actually the Phantom Thief Psiren?

241
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,400
Wh-What are you talking about?

242
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,560
I just came here to 
get some medicine.

243
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,600
Yeah, medicine that you 
transmuted through alchemy.

244
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,120
You lying bitch!

245
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,480
I don't see how I'm a liar. 
I am an incredible beauty, right?

246
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,290
Just like I told you.

247
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,170
That's not the issue here!

248
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,250
Brother!

249
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,760
Brother, bad news...

250
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,470
Is something the matter?

251
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,220
What do you think is the matter?!

252
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,930
She's Psiren! Look!

253
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,120
The transmutation circle on her chest is more proof than anything!

254
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,980
A lot can happen in one's life.

255
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,990
You kids probably 
wouldn't understand.

256
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,080
What?!

257
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,200
I understand.

258
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,110
I heard earlier that the hospital is going to be demolished.

259
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:31,850
Clara-san, you had no choice but to become a thief in order to save the hospital, right?

260
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,050
That's it, right, Clara-san?

261
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,920
Th-That's right.

262
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,260
I didn't want to become a thief.

263
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,670
But in order to save 
the patients here,

264
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,030
I had no choice.

265
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,000
I knew it.

266
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,800
You're such a kind person.

267
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,250
Sensei!

268
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,170
Sensei! There's another notice from Psiren...

269
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,640
Is something the matter?

270
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,000
Sensei?

271
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,190
It looks like there's less security around this time.

272
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,660
Yeah. The owner of this mansion is a very cautious man, you see.

273
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,160
There's a little trap 
set up inside the mansion.

274
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,370
A trap?

275
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,980
Just watch, and you'll understand. 
This time, Psiren has had it for sure!

276
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:22,070
But the unexpected could always happen. If it does, we'll be counting on you.

277
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,650
What should we do, Brother?

278
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,020
Oh, no!

279
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,020
A trap?

280
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,250
Kid...

281
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,250
Why did you help me out?

282
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,610
I didn't particularly help <i>you</i> out.

283
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,810
There are times when 
wrongdoing may be necessary.

284
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:14,970
That's all I thought.

285
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,830
If that's what it takes 
to save the hospital...

286
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,980
What's so funny?!

287
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,220
It's just that you sound like such a grown-up.

288
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,730
I <i>am</i> a grown-up!

289
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,240
Right. As a grown woman, 
I have to repay my debt to you.

290
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,740
Is there anything you'd like me to do for you?

291
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,950
Just answer me one thing.

292
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,960
If you're an alchemist, you must've 
heard about the Philosopher's Stone.

293
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,880
If you have any information about it, tell me.

294
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,460
I have to get that stone, 
no matter what.

295
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:50,970
Sorry.

296
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,440
It doesn't look like I can help you.

297
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,640
How about instead,

298
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,890
if you ever find out where the stone is, you let me know? I'll steal it for you.

299
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,400
Hey!

300
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,150
I'm glad you're able 
to save the hospital.

301
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,490
Sure! Thanks to you!

302
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,510
What's going on here?

303
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,820
Don't tell me she tricked us...

304
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,960
No way! Clara-san would be 
the last person to do something like that.

305
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,870
There has to be 
some kind of mistake!

306
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,440
The only mistakes going on are inside that head of yours!

307
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,010
<i>Clara</i> has robbed 
your head of <i>clarity</i>!

308
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,320
That's terrible, Brother, 
saying it like that!

309
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,670
You mustn't argue. 
It goes against the will of God.

310
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,180
Clara-san...

311
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,600
You...?

312
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,190
It's too bad about the hospital.

313
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:51,360
I tried to save it, 
but I was too late.

314
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,820
I was so beside myself 
with grief that I...

315
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,530
became a nun!

316
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,790
Clara-san!

317
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,030
I'll just bet.

318
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,810
It's true!

319
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,730
Those who believe will be saved.

320
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,400
And there are still others 
whom I can save.

321
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,040
For example, this convent.

322
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,880
It will soon be demolished!

323
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,590
I-I knew it!

324
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:14,590
You're right! This time, 
you've got to stick with it, please!

325
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,900
We'll give you our support, too!

326
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,350
Brother! Bad news!

327
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,640
What is it?!

328
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,640
They're saying that Psiren appeared again! 
The whole city is in an uproar!

329
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,100
She's done it! 
Now the convent can be saved!

330
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,070
There's some kind of mistake.

331
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,620
Right, Brother?

332
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,900
What are you, an idiot?! Quit being such a nice guy already! She's a con artist!

333
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,880
She's just been teasing us 
and having herself a laugh!

334
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,100
Don't say it like that, Brother!

335
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,250
You shouldn't fight. 
Stop it, boys.

336
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,640
Why, you! What are you this time, in that getup?

337
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,610
I know! You've become a schoolteacher, right?

338
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,720
You're fighting for a school 
that's soon to be destroyed!

339
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,470
That's it, right? 
Isn't that right, Clara-san?!

340
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,200
Y-Yes, yes. Well done.

341
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,190
Stop jerking us around!

342
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,690
What are you? 
Are you just a thief after all?

343
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,950
A common criminal, who uses alchemy for her own selfish interests?!

344
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,450
Well, that's a good question.

345
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,950
You're a grown-up, right?

346
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,450
Think about it for yourself.

347
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,050
Extra! Extra!

348
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,050
Another notice from Psiren!

349
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,660
What are you so pleased about? 
Psiren is just a common criminal, right?

350
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:46,140
What are you talking about? We owe Psiren for saving the city of Aquroya.

351
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,750
She's our star of hope, you know!

352
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,650
Your star of hope?

353
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,000
This cityâ€”the City of Water, Aquroyaâ€”

354
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,150
sinks a little bit into 
the water every year.

355
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,660
In another five years, the whole city will be wiped out at the bottom of the lake.

356
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,300
Because of that, 
everyone else fled the city.

357
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:10,420
That made us all so lonesome. At least until Psiren appeared.

358
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,130
But thanks to Psiren, 
life has returned to the city.

359
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,170
Reporters from all over the country 
and tourists alike

360
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:20,510
come here in the hope of 
catching a glimpse of Psiren.

361
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,540
Before disappearing under the water,

362
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,180
she has made Aquroya bloom one last time.

363
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,990
What does it mean, Brother?

364
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,100
Could it be that Clara-san 
became a thief to save the city?

365
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,190
Maybe. The one thing 
I can say for sure...

366
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,950
is that she tricked meâ€”

367
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,320
the Fullmetal Alchemist.

368
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,350
She's going to pay for that offense, at least.

369
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,670
I thought you would come,

370
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:01,970
kid.

371
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,700
Pretty fantastic, isn't it? 
A date here, on the water.

372
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,830
Shut up, you crook.

373
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,700
Dear me, the same could be said of you, couldn't it?

374
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,020
You want the Philosopher's Stone, right?

375
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,520
The desire to have an object...

376
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,690
is the same in both of us.

377
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,480
Maybe so.

378
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:21,650
However...

379
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,900
there is something that's different.

380
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,160
What we use our alchemy for, 
and the burdens we each bear.

381
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,410
Here I go, kid.

382
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,830
I did it...

383
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,080
That was pretty sharp, kid.

384
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,610
I'm sure you'll turn into a fine man. 
Once you do, let's fight again.

385
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:16,180
Next time, as a man and a woman.

386
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,910
Clara-san...

387
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,750
Let me tell you one last thing.

388
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,500
It's about the Philosopher's Stone.

389
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,340
What?

390
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,480
Go to the city of Xenotime and have a look.

391
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,270
I've heard that there's somebody there researching the Philosopher's Stone.

392
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,670
Xenotime...

393
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:41,640
What, are you still angry? 
I had no choice, you know.

394
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,490
She was, after all, 
a common criminal.

395
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:45,450
She was <i>not</i>!

396
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,870
She wasn't just 
a common criminal.

397
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:52,770
Brother, you said yourself that sometimes, wrongdoing is necessary, didn't you?

398
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,850
Clara-san was...

399
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,550
Clara-san was a kind person.

400
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,960
You really think so too, Brother!

401
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,670
About that...

402
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,980
I'm not sure.

403
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,480
Say, it's a little bit warm in here.

404
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,980
Could I get you to lower the zipper on my chest?

405
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,700
With you always in my sight, I can manage to draw breath

406
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,700
itsumo no shisen ni kimi ga ite kokyuu ga dekiru

407
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:43,100
And for me, that ought to be enough in itself, and yet...

408
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:43,100
boku ni totte nara sore dake de mou juubun na hazu na no ni

409
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:51,000
All little old me ever does is repeat the same old mistakes

410
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:51,000
chippoke na boku wa kurikaesu ayamachi bakari

411
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,460
How much strength do I need to come by

412
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,460
dore hodo tsuyosa wo te ni shitara

413
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,430
before I can get by without hurting anything?

414
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,430
nanimo kizutsukezu ni sumu no?

415
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,960
I am not going to stray, I'm going to trust this love,

416
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,960
mayowazu ni kono ai wo,

417
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,770
and with it I will go on living!

418
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,770
shinjikite yuku

419
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,330
I'm going to take these wounds,

420
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,330
fusagaranu

421
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,020
the ones that will not close, and squeeze them tight!

422
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,020
kizuguchi mo gyutto dakishimete

423
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,280
The two of us must keep on walking,

424
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,280
futari wa arukitsuzukeru

425
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,160
The two of us must keep on walking,

426
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,160
futari wa arukitsuzukeru

427
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,250
since we can never return again

428
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,250
ato ni wa modorenai kara

429
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:29,300
Even now, deep within my heart,

430
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:29,300
ima demo kono mune no oku,

431
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:35,250
I still feel the pain of this indelible sin

432
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:35,250
kesenai tsumi wa itamu kedo

433
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:35,510
Darling

434
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,600
Darling

435
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,640
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

436
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,960
Land of Stones, Part 1

437
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,910
Land of Stones, Part 1

438
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,980
Land of Stones, Part 1

439
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,730
Episode 11: "Land of Stones, Part 1"

440
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,730
Another me...

441
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,780
Another Brother...

442
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,740
And a red stone that binds the four of us together.
