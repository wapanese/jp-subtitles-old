00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,160
Roy Mustang observation journal...

2
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,570
What is this?

3
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,170
As it turns out, I've been ordered by 
Internal Affairs to inspect my superior officer.

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,580
"In order that we may understand how your days are spent,

5
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,260
those who are most suited to the task 
are to conduct a top-secret inspection."

6
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,420
So, Lieutenant Havoc, 
you're inspecting Colonel Mustang?

7
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,920
Yeah. But I can't investigate him 
all on my own.

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,640
I want all of you to help me.

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,370
"Saturday, 0946 hours:

10
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,150
Colonel Mustang bluntly calls the documents before him that are due at noon to be a pain."

11
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,810
"Similarly, Saturday, 1026 hours:

12
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,160
the Colonel attempted to feed Lieutenant Hawkeye's dog."

13
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,360
"Also, 1103 hours:

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,060
the Colonel suddenly began to clean the windows."

15
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,160
"Will he be able to 
meet his deadline?"

16
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,320
"1147 hours:

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,610
the Colonel begins signing the documents as 
he makes a fuss about not having enough time."

18
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,170
"But he <i>did</i> have time."

19
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,180
"In the afternoon, the Colonel conducted an 
inspection of the fire-fighting facilities around town."

20
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,680
"At this time, the Colonel received a letter 
from the woman working at the flower shop."

21
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,680
"It appears that the letter is an invitation to a date."

22
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,180
"Have witnessed tickets to a play."

23
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,590
"The Colonel readied to leave,

24
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,500
saying he was gathering municipal intelligence, and would go directly home afterward."

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,690
"Judging by his face, 
he is clearly going on a date."

26
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,640
Just a minute! The woman at the flower shop! You mean Grace?!

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,180
I thought her attitude toward me had cooled off lately. Is that what's going on?!

28
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,750
"What's this, Lieutenant? 
You were seeing that girl?"

29
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,600
"You're out of luck 
against the Colonel."

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,550
"I'm sorry to hear that. Please give up on her."

31
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,960
Stop making light of it!

32
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,960
"How could you guys 
know how I feel?!"

33
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,420
"It's your fault you got dumped. No question about it."

34
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,550
"Shut up, you big dope!"

35
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,660
"No, you are!"

36
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,660
"What did you call me?!"

37
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,890
"Attaboy, get him, get him!"

38
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,470
"Don't be so rough on each other. 
Let's all get along."

39
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,970
I quit! I quit!

40
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,470
How am I supposed to do this investigation?!

41
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,580
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

42
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,120
Here at the Central Command Center, 
there are brave soldiers who have no trouble

43
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,490
sacrificing whatever it takes in order to achieve peace.

44
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:22,330
These are the tales of love and courage of the Flame Alchemist—Colonel Roy Mustang—and his men.

45
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,660
Far away, far away, our dreams will never fade

00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,660

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,960

The Fighting Lieutenant

77
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,010
Yo,

78
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,990
Black Hayate.

79
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,910
Sure must be nice for you,

80
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,520
leading a happy-go-lucky life.

81
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,360
What's the matter with 
Lieutenant Havoc?

82
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,920
He must've had his heart broken again or something.

83
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,920
That was sharp.

84
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,730
You can't get much time off 
when you take on military duties.

85
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,870
It must be hard finding a woman who will go out with you.

86
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,410
He's pathetic.

87
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,230
If he were a man, he'd find a way to handle both his work and women.

88
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,870
<i>It's your fault!</i>

89
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,680
Still, as things are, 
it's interfering with his duties.

90
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,620
Hey, someone introduce a woman to Havoc.

91
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,410
<i>Please don't ask the impossible!</i>

92
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,770
<i>I want someone to introduce me!</i>

93
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,380
<i>Colonel, why don't you share one of yours?!</i>

94
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,390
What?

95
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,460
Nothing.

96
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,400
Does anyone know what 
kind of woman Havoc likes?

97
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,880
Uh, the other day, when I was out drinking with Havoc,

98
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,400
he complained to me, "Aren't there any 
cheerful, well-adjusted beauties out there?"

99
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,770
All right, Warrant Officer Falman,

100
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,400
secure a cheerful, 
well-adjusted beauty at once.

101
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,650
Introduce her to Lt. Havoc.

102
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,160
You want <i>me</i> to?!

103
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,360
Remember, you're on a mission.

104
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,070
There's a mission for me?

105
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:15,620
All the materials on Brig. Gen. Basque Grand, 
Doctor Marcoh, and Shou Tucker.

106
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,070
Also, put together all the records on 
the 5th Laboratory and the 2nd Prison.

107
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,130
Right.

108
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,920
Does that include the items 
lost in the Central Library fire?

109
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,640
Do not ask me the obvious. That is why I called on you.

110
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,940
<i>If this can get me into the 
Court-Martial Office again,</i>

111
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,660
<i>I might be able to more closely investigate the incident involving Brig. Gen. Hughes.</i>

112
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,660
What is your answer?

113
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,650
Y-Yes! Understood!

114
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,230
A mission, he says. 
I haven't had any training in flirting.

115
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,650
What's the world coming to?

116
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,680
I beg your pardon! 
Are you all right?!

117
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,530
Scieszka?

118
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,870
Warrant Officer Falman!

119
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,060
Long time no see.

120
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,370
Have you been 
getting along okay?

121
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,250
Yes...

122
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,380
more or less.

123
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,380
I know!

124
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,490
Scieszka, I'm looking for a cheerful, well-adjusted beauty right now.

125
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,810
Do you know anyone like that?

126
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,040
Do I know anyone?

127
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:15,160
So what you're insinuating is that I'm <i>not</i> a cheerful, well-adjusted beauty, huh?

128
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,890
Ah, it's not like that!

129
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,470
Under the Colonel's orders, I have to introduce Lt. Havoc to a new girlfriend.

130
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,900
Girlfriend?

131
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,730
Do you have anyone in mind?

132
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,400
Oh, in that case,

133
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,900
I have a grand idea!

134
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,910
Major Armstrong's sister?

135
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,970
Yes.

136
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,530
He said that she is of marrying age but is so shy that she cannot find a boyfriend.

137
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,260
Incredible...

138
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,790
I think I'd better go...

139
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,180
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for you!

140
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,000
If she starts talking about tying the knot, you'll be taking one wealthy wife!

141
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,200
You'll be on easy street!

142
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,030
But I haven't even met her yet.

143
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,530
From what Major Armstrong says, 
she has the same dashing looks that he does.

144
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,900
The Major's sister 
looks just like him?

145
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,770
That's it, I'm leaving!

146
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,330
Thank you for coming, Lt. Havoc!

147
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,080
We've been waiting for you!

148
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,550
Well, good luck!

149
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:32,880
Over the span of 180 years, the Armstrong family has been involved in enterprises

150
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,440
that are deeply tied in with the political and economic affairs of this land.

151
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,640
For generations, it has been a noble family that has served in the military government

152
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,120
and has been a pillar of support 
to this nation.

153
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,650
I myself have served in 
the military government...

154
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,310
Every time I hear Father tell the story, it is marvelous.

155
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,160
Oh my, Dear,

156
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,730
are you boasting 
to the guests again?

157
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,160
Oh, Mother...

158
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,420
<i>Mother?</i>

159
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,160
<i>Thank goodness!</i>

160
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,120
<i>The mother is quite norm—</i>

161
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,170
<i>She's huge! 
She's not at all normal!</i>

162
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,650
<i>Hold on a minute now.</i>

163
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,680
<i>The father is wide and fat,</i>

164
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,180
<i>and the mother is long and tall.</i>

165
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,110
<i>Add them together, and their son 
would sum up like this.</i>

166
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,190
<i>Which means, when it 
comes to their daughter...</i>

167
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,950
Catch me if you can!

168
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,960
No, both parents' features don't always necessarily get passed down.

169
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,470
There's a chance that she leans more toward one side.

170
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,210
Now then, Lieutenant, 
allow me to introduce my sister.

171
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,710
Come along, Catherine. 
Don't be shy. Come in here.

172
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,940
<i>Which is she?!</i>

173
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,300
<i>Does she take after her father, 
or her mother?!</i>

174
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,180
<i>I couldn't stand it either way, but between the two of them,</i>

175
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,760
<i>at least let her 
take after her mother!</i>

176
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,720
Um...

177
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,720
Uh...

178
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,730
Nice to meet you.

179
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,620
I'm Catherine Elle Armstrong.

180
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,230
<i>Hooray for mutations!</i>

181
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,320
Well? Isn't she beautiful? She looks just like me.

182
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,980
Which part?!

183
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,550
Her lower eyelashes, and such.

184
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,990
You don't say.

185
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,870
Come now, Catherine. 
Don't be shy.

186
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,000
R-Right.

187
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,500
So, Catherine-san, 
what are your hobbies?

188
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,920
Let's see... a little piano...

189
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,920
<i>How cute! There's no way 
this girl is the Major's sister!</i>

190
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,310
I lift a little piano...

191
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,640
What is the matter, Lieutenant?

192
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,480
<i>I take that back. 
She absolutely is the Major's sister!</i>

193
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,140
<i>But then again, if you take away her monstrous strength, there's...</i>

194
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,140
<i>her looks...</i>

195
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,140
<i>her figure...</i>

196
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,150
<i>her assets...</i>

197
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,150
<i>and her influence.</i>

198
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,210
<i>Does that make it all okay?</i>

199
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,610
<i>Is this...</i>

200
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,150
<i>the prime of my life?</i>

201
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,430
Catherine-san...

202
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,270
Yes?

203
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,910
If it's all right with you,

204
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,780
would you allow me 
the chance to go out with you?

205
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,880
H-Havoc-san...

206
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,250
Yes?

207
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,270
I...

208
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,610
I...

209
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,150
I...

210
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,870
prefer men who are 
more like my brother.

211
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:28,510
Havoc-san, you are not my type, 
so let's pretend we never spoke of this.

212
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,700
That is too bad.

213
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,480
Oh? What's the matter, Lieutenant?

214
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,320
10,000 cens says he blows it.

215
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,950
10,000 cens says she turns him down.

216
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,490
Okay, 30,000 cens says 
they call the whole thing off.

217
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,540
That doesn't make for 
much of a wager, you know.

218
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,990
That's right!

219
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,380
Why did I even come here?

220
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,080
The Mystery of Warehouse 13

221
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,080
The Mystery of Warehouse 13

222
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:00,450
Well, Major Armstrong is exactly the kind of man I figured him for.

223
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,900
Lieutenant Hawkeye, 
can you put out a dragnet?

224
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,600
Yes.

225
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,100
I'm starving.

226
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,180
I've had to go without lunch ever since I lost that bet.

227
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,390
I won, so I've been 
eating my fill.

228
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,420
Please buy me something!

229
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,750
If I did that, the bet wouldn't mean anything, would it?

230
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,240
Aren't those fixed yet?

231
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,370
I sure do hate this. 
The whole area is creepy.

232
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,220
There are even stories of ghosts appearing here.

233
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,230
What's that sound?

234
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,880
It couldn't be...

235
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,390
There it is!

236
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,750
No...

237
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,840
Don't do that...

238
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,800
You're tickling me...

239
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,420
Jeez...

240
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,920
Wait!

241
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,500
Sit!

242
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,610
Shake!

243
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,780
The other one!

244
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,910
Lie down!

245
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,800
All right.

246
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,970
Good morning, Lieutenant.

247
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:39,650
Morning.

248
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,900
Hey, seriously?

249
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,020
Yes, seriously.

250
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,120
The stories are true!

251
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,070
Give me a break! I won't be able to go out walking at night anymore!

252
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,410
Has something happened?

253
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,910
They say they saw the 13th warehouse. What nonsense.

254
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,160
It's not nonsense, Colonel!

255
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,420
That's right! 
We really are scared here!

256
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,300
The 13th warehouse?

257
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,330
Military warehouses are only supposed to go up to the 12th warehouse.

258
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,600
They say that there's 
a 13th one that appears!

259
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,020
In fact, they say that the location where it stands was an execution ground a long time ago!

260
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,630
When night falls, 
the 13th warehouse

261
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,420
appears in the place where 
there should only be twelve of them!

262
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,450
And the ghosts of those who were executed there long ago

263
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,530
can be heard scra... scraping,

264
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,300
digging up the ground, 
looking for their own bodies!

265
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,530
Ha! That's ridiculous. 
You look at things in a state of fear,

266
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:31,470
so you're just imagining the things 
that you're afraid of.

267
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,040
You must've just mistook it 
for something else.

268
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,860
Colonel, aren't you afraid?

269
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,920
Of course not. 
Alchemists are scientists.

270
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,300
It's our job to always look at things 
with a logical mind.

271
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,930
But we're not the 
only ones who saw it.

272
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,800
There are stories all over the Command Center.

273
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,700
This is pathetic. 
You call yourselves soldiers?

274
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,210
I'm going to reveal the reality of the situation

275
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,020
to those who would spread these kinds of stories!

276
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,650
Really?!

277
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:58,100
Everyone, rejoice! The Colonel says 
he's going to join our operation tonight!

278
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,420
That's our colonel! 
He thinks about his men!

279
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,790
Thank goodness! With the Colonel along, there's nothing to be afraid of!

280
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,400
Just a minute! 
What are you talking about?

281
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,600
You know, tonight's operation to uncover the truth about the ghostly phenomena.

282
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,050
You're going to show us 
the reality of it, right, Colonel?

283
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,800
I did say that, but...

284
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,490
I'm afraid to go home to the dorms at night.

285
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,840
Please help us, Colonel!

286
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,990
For crying out loud, why do I have to 
tag along on their little test of courage?!

287
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,090
They all adore you, Colonel.

288
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,180
Why should I be pleased 
over being adored by men?

289
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,350
How can men serve as soldiers against flesh-and-blood men,

290
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,180
when something they can't even see makes them jump out of their skin?

291
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,250
I didn't tell you to stop.

292
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,350
You looked like 
you wanted to stop.

293
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,850
Oh, Colonel Mustang!

294
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,290
Sorry to drop in on you 
so unexpectedly.

295
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,550
I was just in the neighborhood.

296
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,250
My, thank you for taking the trouble to see me.

297
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,010
Go on, Elicia, 
can you say hello?

298
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,510
Hey there, Elicia. 
How are you?

299
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,270
Well, come on inside. 
I'll serve some tea.

300
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,360
No, I still have 
some work to attend to,

301
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,860
so I'll be leaving.

302
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,870
Like I said...

303
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,730
It's much more frightening to take on a live person.

304
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,260
Indeed, this is perfect.

305
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,000
There's nothing in here about it.

306
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,130
There aren't any more documents that Hughes left behind, right?

307
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,630
Yes, nothing more.

308
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,350
Fine, then.

309
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,120
Dispose of all of these materials.

310
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,220
Don't even leave ashes.

311
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,490
But these are official 
military documents...

312
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,220
I don't care.

313
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,290
The 5th Laboratory 
had been shut down.

314
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,900
It's only natural that there wouldn't be any records, wouldn't it?

315
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,020
But there are <i>too</i> few of them. Even if it was shut down,

316
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,900
it's not natural for there not to be any records of installation maintenance.

317
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,990
Someone was 
neglecting their duties.

318
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,270
You mean Brig. Gen. Grand?

319
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,010
What are you trying to say?

320
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,490
That it wasn't a mishap with the records, but that there <i>are</i> no records.

321
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,710
This is evidence that there was 
a military directive to cover it up.

322
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:28,120
Though I couldn't imagine that the Führer was aware of this.

323
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,610
Chimeras that were 
formed from humans...

324
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:34,920
Amplification of alchemic powers 
by means of a Philosopher's Stone...

325
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,050
Both would be powerful military assets in battle.

326
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,930
You <i>do</i> know that those techniques are forbidden, right?

327
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,670
Science is the result 
of trial and error.

328
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,940
Failing to utilize the mistakes of the past by learning from them,

329
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,940
and abandoning them as being too dangerous would be foolish, would it not?

330
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,200
Right now, I have Zolf Kimbly and Shou Tucker under me.

331
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,780
All I would need is your order.

332
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:59,450
There's a rebellion 
starting up again in Liore.

333
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,760
There is also intelligence that Scar is in hiding.

334
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,080
How would you like to 
test your powers there?

335
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:06,850
Yes, sir.

336
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,590
For Pete's sake... For grown men to all gang up over some ghostly disturbance...

337
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,370
But we really are frightened.

338
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,140
Colonel, having you along will be a great help.

339
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,250
Let's just investigate this quick 
and go home!

340
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,890
From here on, the streetlights are out, so there's no light.

341
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,560
What is Maintenance up to?! This is dereliction of duty!

342
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,150
That should do it.

343
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,900
It's just your shadow, you idiot!

344
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,120
Sergeant Fuery, if you do this, you can make shadows fun!

345
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,620
See? It's a cute doggie.

346
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,120
Woof! Woof!

347
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,800
Stop being so scared by everything!

348
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,830
That's easy for you to say.

349
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,100
We really are scared!

350
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,100
I want to go home.

351
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,090
You call yourselves my men?!

352
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,670
Come on! I'll prove to you that there are no ghosts!

353
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,100
Don't leave us behind, Colonel!

354
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,140
Here is Warehouse 12.

355
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,170
Beyond it is just an empty lot.

356
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,870
Look! Where do you 
see Warehouse 13?

357
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,090
Maybe it's hiding because 
there are a lot of people here.

358
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,110
Enough already!

359
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,860
Could it be that they mean <i>that</i> 
when they say 13?

360
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:23,370
The letter "B" from the alphabet. It looked like the number 13.

361
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,800
It's true, you could mistake it for that.

362
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,450
So, in the dark and out of fear, what you did was misread it.

363
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,880
Jeez, you're such a scaremonger.

364
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,210
Look! Once you realize what you're dealing with, that's all there is to it!

365
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,800
So, what about the ghosts?

366
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,160
They don't exist!

367
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,250
Thank goodness! Now I can relax walking past here tomorrow.

368
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,630
Now that you know, 
we're done here.

369
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,390
Let's go home!

370
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,450
Now that I can relax, 
I'm feeling hungry.

371
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,010
Once we get back, 
how about some supper?

372
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,390
You guys are buying tonight.

373
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,110
Huh? I don't have any money!

374
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,920
That's what you get 
for scaring us.

375
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,650
Hold it.

376
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,920
What is it?

377
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,940
Look at this.

378
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:57,440
What is it?

379
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,140
Looks like something 
was dug up here.

380
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,060
It couldn't be...

381
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,700
Falman!

382
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,380
Right.

383
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,400
What's this?

384
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,010
A bone.

385
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,630
Sure enough, it's the ghost of an executed prisoner!

386
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,810
I-It's really here!

387
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:28,770
Calm down! Even if this were an execution grounds,

388
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,540
they wouldn't be burying them here too, you know!

389
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,540
This is a case of someone 
dumping a body.

390
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,780
A body illegally dumped in a place 
said to be a former execution grounds.

391
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:40,530
There aren't any criminals who would come 
all the way onto a military base just to bury this.

392
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:44,070
Which means, you're saying that 
this is an incident internal to the military?

393
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,000
It's highly possible. It's also possible that this bone belongs to a soldier.

394
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,440
Establishing the identity of 
the victim is our top priority!

395
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,640
Do not overlook anything!

396
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,850
They won't necessarily be buried in just one spot.

397
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,640
Dig up anywhere 
that looks suspicious.

398
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,730
Roger!

399
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,090
Hey, would you mind if I 
told you what I'm thinking?

400
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,600
Who's the one who put us up to this nonsense?!

401
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,300
Has something happened?

402
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,730
Never mind.

403
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,650
Yes?

404
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,950
Colonel, the tiger is on the move.

405
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,650
I'm looking forward to 
hearing good things from you.

406
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,540
Excuse me!

407
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,570
What is it?

408
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,550
I request permission to go along with the dispatch eastward.

409
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:26,540
I have requested Major Armstrong to oversee combat on this trip.

410
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,550
The Major is staying 
off the front lines

411
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,560
due to the injuries he sustained in the recent fighting in Ishbal.

412
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,040
I question whether the Major, who has not particularly distinguished himself in battle,

413
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,560
should be given command of the forces on the front line.

414
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,410
I also have a responsibility to this case, 
having once been stationed

415
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,610
at the Eastern Command Center.

416
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,670
Please allow me to 
go along with them.

417
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,320
I have no objections.

418
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,520
Very well. 
Colonel Roy Mustang,

419
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,770
I hereby order you to go along with 
the eastern suppression detachment.

420
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,400
I humbly accept your order!

421
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:14,370
On the day you left,

422
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:14,370

426
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:21,660

430
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,880
