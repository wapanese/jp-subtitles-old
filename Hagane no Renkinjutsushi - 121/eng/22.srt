1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,310
What is it? 
It's the middle of the night.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,030
Oh, there's just something that was concerning me.

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,870
If it's about Scar, 
I still don't have anything.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,740
Or is this about Marcoh, 
in the care of the Führer?

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,820
Yeah, there is that too,

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,740
but lately, it feels like 
we haven't even appeared—

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,790
That idiot. 
He doesn't know how I feel.

8
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:26,460
I wonder if you shouldn't have also reported to Colonel Mustang.

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,180
About the brothers, I mean.

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,470
We don't need to tell him. 
Not yet.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,220
The group that I was going to send to the library for security is standing by.

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,430
They should be more reliable than I am for now.

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,520
Does that mean...

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,210
Yeah. On my own authority, 
I approve the entrance and investigation

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,580
of the site of the 5th Laboratory.

16
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,020
However, get ready to be punished.

17
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,370
I hate that place!

18
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,980
It's been a long time, huh, boy?

19
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,450
But then, I guess it was 
four years ago that you first saw me.

20
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,820
That night, 
with the pretty fireworks.

21
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,030
Who in the world are you?

22
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,390
That other guy said 
you were a homunculus.

23
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,080
But that couldn't be...

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,040
Oh, why is that?

25
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,000
A homunculus is an 
artificially created person.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,050
A human who isn't human...

27
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,680
But there has never been anyone 
who could create one. It's impossible.

28
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,950
Impossible? There's no such thing.

29
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,800
After all, there's a boy who is nothing but a soul standing in front of me.

30
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,360
You're not a person!

31
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,470
Can I eat him?

32
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,010
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

33
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,610
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

34
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,660
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

35
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,020
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

36
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,160
Ready, steady, can't hold me back

37
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,510
Ready, steady, give me good luck

38
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,810
Ready, steady, never look back

39
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,210
Let's get started, ready, steady, go!

Created Human

80
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,220
I'm starting to understand 
the research that took place here.

81
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,500
The gist of it is the large-scale military use of alchemy—

82
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,590
in particular, research related to human transmutation.

83
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,600
They used these incomplete Philosopher's Stones.

84
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,460
Knowing you, it's possible that you can complete the Philosopher's Stones.

85
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,480
You know how these things are manufactured?

86
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,110
No. By the time 
I was brought here,

87
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,430
those had already been mass-produced and then abandoned.

88
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:06,710
The person who was in charge here before, 
Doctor Marcoh, must have left them behind.

89
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,410
What's that?

90
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,490
Regardless of what they are made from, 
do they have any meaning?

91
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,110
Even if the ingredients are people,

92
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,550
would you be able 
to turn them back?

93
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,140
In that case, making them into complete Stones would give them a lot more meaning.

94
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,580
I agree with him.

95
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,640
You?

96
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:38,150
As they are, their lives 
will have meant nothing at all.

97
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,250
But...

98
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,030
No meaning, huh?

99
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,580
Al,

100
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,460
your life hasn't lost its meaning, huh?

101
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,440
You have overtime 
this late into the night?

102
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,750
F-Führer! Sorry to cause a commotion.

103
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,950
I hear you have suspicions 
about the 5th Laboratory.

104
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,250
There have been rumors before now, but I always overlooked them,

105
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,700
thinking Brig. Gen. Grand was 
working for the good of the military.

106
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:41,710
However, now that the lives of the two young alchemists are at stake, things are different.

107
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,420
I'll send a squad with the Major, 
and go myself.

108
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,800
There's no way 
I'm having you go in alone.

109
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,480
Where is the scarred man?

110
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,180
He dropped into a nasty place.

111
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,520
I see. No matter.

112
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,090
Greed may be coming to interfere.

113
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,520
We'll have to get the Fullmetal boy 
to speed things up.

114
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,820
This is the area right above 
the transmutation circle, right?

115
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,980
They've been made into storage tanks, to supply the Philosopher's Stones

116
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,080
in the room below us.

117
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,300
All right, I can use this.

118
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:51,460
You humans... Really, a hundred years can go by, and you never change.

119
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,160
What's with that bastard?

120
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,070
Is he really a soldier?

121
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,050
Do you still think that person is His Excellency, Basque Grand?

122
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,200
His Excellency isn't that great a bigwig.

123
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,430
You're going to transmute in 
both rooms at the same time?

124
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:25,060
Yeah. The Philosopher's Stones in this room alone won't be enough,

125
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:30,030
and even Marcoh-san's research suggested a way of using two transmutation circles.

126
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,060
The Philosopher's Stones above, 
and the Philosopher's Stones here,

127
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,260
will collide with the two circles and condense together.

128
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,450
That kind of explosive power is necessary to refine them.

129
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,290
I'm changing the transmutation circle, too.

130
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,340
A transmutation circle with seven corners...

131
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,950
First time I've seen one.

132
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,370
It just came to me.

133
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,460
If I succeed in creating a Philosopher's Stone,

134
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,200
I'm going to return Al to normal and then disappear.

135
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,830
You can do whatever 
you want to after that.

136
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,650
I'm glad to hear that.

137
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,580
Let us out!

138
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,280
Is anyone out there?!

139
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,500
Hey!

140
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,750
Stifle it, will you?

141
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,500
What are you all relaxed about?

142
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,510
Not even you, the comrade-killer, 
once known as the Crimson Alchemist,

143
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,510
can do anything about this, can you?

144
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,900
Do you know why I am 
called the comrade-killer?

145
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,510
Y-You blew up all your comrades, right? 
With bombs?

146
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,730
Bombs?

147
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,970
I have no need for such things.

148
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,140
The human body is 
composed of mostly water,

149
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,530
but there is a certain quantity of metallic atoms included within.

150
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,420
By making use of that composition,

151
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,370
and a small amount of organic compounds,

152
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,000
I can easily transmute 
explosive materials.

153
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,250
And... when surrounded 
by this much red water,

154
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,250
my power becomes...

155
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,780
Why are there people here?

156
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,480
Were there any other 
researchers left beside you?

157
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,340
What those people are wearing are prisoner uniforms.

158
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,730
Why are they here?! If I had transmuted without knowing they were there...

159
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,000
You guys! Who brought you here?!

160
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,050
I did, Fullmetal Alchemist!

161
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,900
Under my orders, the prisoners from the 2nd Prison were relocated here.

162
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,270
And whose permission 
did <i>you</i> obtain to be here?

163
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,250
That was a close one.

164
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,280
The general died, 
right before my eyes.

165
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,440
Who are you?

166
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,940
Nice to meet you, 
Fullmetal Pipsqueak.

167
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm impressed that you found your way here.

168
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,010
Just kidding, you good-for-nothing!

169
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:45,220
Whoa! My, you really 
are driven, huh, Pipsqeak?

170
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,320
That's too bad. I really 
hate fighting, you know?

171
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,150
You shut up with that "Pipsqueak" stuff!

172
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,100
You're the one who 
started this fight!

173
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:02,600
Good grief, you don't even know your own place.

174
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,870
Do you know who you're 
picking a fight with? Huh?

175
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,870
We've only kept you alive because we were told to keep you alive!

176
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,400
You're going to pay...

177
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,710
You're definitely going to pay!

178
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,290
You, who carry his blood!

179
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,680
Envy!

180
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,850
It's your fault for not thoroughly checking the ingredients.

181
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,810
You...

182
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,980
You don't want this experience to become any more painful, right?

183
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,810
If not, would you be good enough to continue with your transmutation for us?

184
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,930
We've had a setback, but there are still ingredients remaining, and all...

185
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,300
Use these prisoners to create a Philosopher's Stone?

186
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,290
You set this up for me to do from the start?

187
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,890
You aren't going to say no to us.

188
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,630
Al!

189
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,070
Brother...

190
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,930
These guys... They're homunculi.

191
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,360
They couldn't be...

192
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,440
He's right.

193
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:26,160
These people are all homunculi—
perfectly created humans.

194
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,870
They have promised to 
reveal their secrets to me.

195
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,900
Once they do, 
Nina will come back to life.

196
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,750
What's the point of bringing just her form back to life?!

197
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,390
Nina's spirit won't be in there!

198
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,460
I <i>do</i> have her spirit.

199
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,960
Right here.

200
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,900
The Nina that lives in my memories.

201
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:52,130
I will transplant all of it 
into the homunculus Nina.

202
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,470
Once I do, the truly perfect Nina—

203
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,840
the greatest one that 
I could desire—will be born.

204
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,230
Transplant... memories?

205
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,450
That won't be Nina!

206
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,440
Okay, that's enough chit-chat.

207
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,380
Fullmetal Pipsqueak,

208
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,910
why don't you start the transmutation already?

209
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,730
First, repair the ceiling.

210
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,860
This is a problem.

211
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,630
We cannot use alchemy.

212
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,660
We have to ask 
someone else to do it.

213
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,120
You can't use alchemy?

214
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,680
So then, why do you need the Philosopher's Stone?

215
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,180
Are you like Cornello?

216
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,010
Are you megalomaniacs, 
with designs on controlling the world?

217
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,860
We want to become human.

218
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,870
That's all.

219
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,150
If you really are homunculi,

220
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,010
then there must be 
an alchemist who created you.

221
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,010
And if even he couldn't create a Philosopher's Stone—

222
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:00,870
We weren't created by anyone! We were born!

223
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,090
All we can do...

224
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,350
is dangle hints about 
the Philosopher's Stone,

225
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:12,680
leading those who desire the Stone to someday complete it.

226
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,560
Hold on. Then you're the ones who taught Mugear how to use the red water?

227
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,060
And informed Marcoh-san and Tucker here in this laboratory of different things?

228
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,690
And in the town of Liore, gave Cornello that fake Philosopher's Stone?

229
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:32,070
By doing so, you fools who held interest in 
the Philosopher's Stone would gather around.

230
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:36,080
And so, we found you.

231
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:41,580
And then I... ended up here?

232
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,240
No! Al and I came this far 
for our own sakes!

233
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,090
Our long journey... 
We've finally arrived...

234
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,100
Because that's what we wanted.

235
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,850
We aren't being controlled by anyone!

236
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,370
It's an equivalent exchange.

237
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,190
We teach you the way to refine the Philosopher's Stone,

238
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,930
you use the Stone

239
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,430
and turn us into humans.

240
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,140
I can't trust you.

241
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,110
Do not misunderstand.

242
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,700
We are not asking you to do this.

243
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,550
This is an order.

244
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,630
After all the trouble it took to bond this soul...

245
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,500
By doing this...

246
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,640
H-Hey! Stop that! 
You stupid bitch!

247
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,640
Edward Elric, I...

248
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,230
It's simple.

249
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,280
Stop!

250
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:03,840
Please stop! Please, don't do anything else to my brother!

251
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,830
Brother!

252
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:09,160
Brother, it's all right. 
After all, I'm just...

253
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,350
<i>Suppose you were an imitation. What would you do then?</i>

254
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:14,840
<i>Do you have any proof that you ever really existed?</i>

255
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,110
You keep quiet, Al!

256
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,870
Brother, stop! Are you serious?!

257
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:54,510
<i>What folly! I knew I should have sent him back to God.</i>

258
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,620
I'm sure the boy can do it.

259
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,220
Brother! Stop!

260
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,730
Brother, stop! 
Those people are human!

261
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,700
Yeah, that's right. So what?

262
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,210
I don't want to go back to my original body if it means sacrificing other humans!

263
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,350
You were aware of that from the beginning,

264
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,420
when you tried to bring your mother back to life, weren't you?

265
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:39,490
Nothing else but a human life will do 
when it comes to human transmutation.

266
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:46,080
For someone to live, they must take from someone else's life, to some degree.

267
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:51,240
In order to accomplish something, a sacrifice must be made.

268
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,260
All grown-ups know that.

269
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,940
But we didn't...!

270
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,380
You didn't care if you are cursed as dogs of the military?

271
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,140
That's what you decided when you entered adult society, isn't it?

272
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:04,790
Don't go turning back into children, now that it suits you.

273
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:11,460
So this is the truth behind truths, is it?

274
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,130
Brother!

275
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,620
Al...

276
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,430
If we give up here, 
then we'll never...

277
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,500
I'm sorry, Al...

278
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,160
I just can't...

279
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,010
Fullmetal Alchemist!

280
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,140
Take your brother and go!

281
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,970
Don't be ridiculous!

282
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,520
The older brother 
protects the younger one!

283
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,600
Al!

284
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,690
We cannot allow 
this to end just yet!

285
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,200
Oh, no...

286
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,870
Even with the unfinished Philosopher's Stone,

287
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,130
with this much of it, 
the caster's power will be augmented.

288
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,510
Ready to charge in 
through the back entrance!

289
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,510
The surrounding area 
is also sealed off!

290
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,850
I repeat, secure the large suit of armor and the boy with the braid.

291
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,730
Take anyone who appears to be 
a civilian employee into custody.

292
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,090
And everyone else?

293
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,400
Mow them down!

294
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,900
Move in!

295
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,790
It couldn't be...! 
The Crimson Alchemist?

296
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,830
Edward-san!

297
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,430
The transmutation reaction 
is increasing without bound!

298
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,930
Lieutenant Ross!

299
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,540
Mom?

300
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,400
Good work.

301
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,790
We are still crying out

302
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,790
bokura wa ima demo sakenderu

304
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,850
You squeeze your right hand, as if to reassure yourself

uzattai housoku o buchikowashite yuke

306
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,700
Go on, take those annoying rules and dash them away!

kizutsuita ashi o yasumaseru gurai nara

308
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,840
If it comes down to having to rest your wounded feet,

tatta ippo demo koko kara susume

310
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,730
you've gotta keep moving forward, if only just a step!

yuganda kaze o kaki wakete

312
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,500
We've pushed our way

313
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,500
through the twisting winds

314
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,630
tsumetai sora o oikoshite

315
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,630
and gotten beyond the cold sky

soredemo mada samayoi tsuzuketeru

317
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,400

319
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,570
We always find ourselves crying out

shinji tsuzukeru dake ga kotae janai

321
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:11,910
Just continuing to believe is not the answer

yowasa mo kizu mo sarake dashite

323
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,620
We must bare our weaknesses and wounds,

mogaki tsuzukenakereba hajimaranai

325
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,300
and continue to struggle,

326
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,300
or nothing will ever turn out!

327
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:29,000

328
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:29,000
Break on through to the other side of the door!

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,600
tobira no mukou e

330
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,600
To the other side of the door!

331
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,460
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

332
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,000
Heart of Steel

333
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,950
Heart of Steel

334
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,020
Heart of Steel

335
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,020
Episode 23: "Heart of Steel"

336
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,400
Brother, what is it that you've been wanting to say for so long, but couldn't?

337
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,030
It's not, by any chance...?
