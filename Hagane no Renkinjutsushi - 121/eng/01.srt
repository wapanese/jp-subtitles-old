1
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,950
It's finished. Al...

2
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,080
It's okay.

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,710
This is perfect.

4
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,490
Let's do it.

5
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,460
Alchemy.

6
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,850
It is the scientific technique of understanding the structure of matter,

7
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,600
decomposing it, and then reconstructing it.

8
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:05,420
If performed skillfully, it is even 
possible to create gold out of lead.

9
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:12,230
However, as it is a science, there are some natural principles in place.

10
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,200
Only one thing can be created from something else of a certain mass.

11
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,470
This is the Principle of Equivalent Exchange.

21

Younger Brother - 10

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,400
What? What's the matter?

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,480
Hold on, Winry!

24
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,870
The Principle of Equivalent Exchange 
states that in order to obtain something,

25
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,790
something else of equal value is required.

26
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,520
Is that some kind of maxim?

27
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,460
Man cannot obtain anything 
without sacrificing something?

28
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,210
Al... Al!

29
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,760
Alphonse!

30
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,070
Dammit! I'm not about to let this happen!

31
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,790
This wasn't... This wasn't supposed to...

32
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,570
Dammit!

33
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,850
He's been taken away!

34
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,320
Mom?

35
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,150
I'm starving...

36
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:04,050
If only there were some grass growing here, 
I could change it into bread.

37
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,660
Al? Al? Where are you?

38
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,120
Al? Al?!

39
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,380
Right here!

40
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,090
Help me, Brother!

41
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,340
You got buried again?

42
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,500
Do that one more time, 
and I'm leaving you behind!

43
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,250
But...

44
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,350
Don't "but" me!

45
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,060
Al...

46
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,480
Wait up, Al!

51
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,370
I'm not waiting!

52
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,870
Stop!

53
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,420
I'm not stopping!

54
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,900
Straighten up!

55
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,200
I won't get buried again!

57
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,210
Those Who Challenge the Sun

58
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,950
Brother, are you okay?

59
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,560
It's all your fault for not stopping.

60
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,190
I don't think anyone would stop 
if they were told to do so like you did.

Town of Liore

65
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,290
Oh, so that's it?

66
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,790
I'm so thirsty...

67
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,280
Water?

68
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,780
Water!

69
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,280
Brother!

70
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,870
Water! Water! Water! 
Water! Water! Water! Water!

71
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,400
<i>This</i> is what I've been smelling all along?

72
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,290
Brother!

73
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,100
Blood?

74
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,480
More like blood-red wine.

75
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,550
Hey, you!

76
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,060
This is off-limits to kids, you know!

77
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,980
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

78
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,110
As travelers, you wouldn't have known that there was wine coming out of there, huh?

79
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,490
Wow! Look at that suit of armor!

80
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,120
The town of Liore here must be pretty prosperous, huh?

81
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,610
Having a wine fountain and all.

82
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,410
Yeah, you might say that. 
Oh, whoops, gotta do this...

83
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,180
All of God's children, 
who live upon this land,

84
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,650
pray in faith, that ye may be saved.

85
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,110
The Sun God Leto 
illuminates thy footsteps.

86
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,500
What's the deal?

87
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,920
God, who watches over thee, 
has descended from his throne,

88
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,920
A religious broadcast?

89
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,830
and saves thee from all thy sins.

90
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,830
As far as I'm concerned, I should be the one 
asking "What's the deal?" of you guys.

91
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,960
I am Leto's representative, and thy father.

92
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,460
Are you guys street performers or something?

93
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,460
I offer up this prayer.

94
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,300
Now look here, Pop! 
Where'd you get that idea from?!

95
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,740
If you're not performers, then what have you come all this way for?

96
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,640
Oh, there's something we're looking for.

97
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,980
So, what's the story with this broadcast?

98
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,240
That's Cornello-sama.

99
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,770
Yeah, and like, who is he?

100
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,850
You don't know the representative of the Sun God Leto?!

101
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,540
No, so who is he?

102
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,300
He's Cornello-sama, 
a performer of miraculous works!

103
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,840
It's because of him that this forsaken town in the middle of the desert

104
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,860
has become as prosperous as it is!

105
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,140
He really is an incredible man!

106
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,950
Yeah! The works that man does are truly miraculous!

107
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,750
I'm not all that interested in religion.

108
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,320
Shall we get going, Al?

109
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,380
Y-Yeah.

110
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,620
Now you've done it, sir!

111
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,000
This is what happens when you 
go around wearing such an outfit!

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,950
Sorry, sorry! I'll fix it right away.

113
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,840
Fix it?

114
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,650
I'm so sorry!

115
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,660
Brother, I'll do it.

116
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,440
Okay.

117
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,000
What's that?

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,190
It's a transmutation circle.

119
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,400
All right...

120
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Transmutation Circle

121
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Transmutation Circle

122
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,530
Okay, here goes!

123
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:24,790
As the representative of Leto, 
I pour out my love unto thee always.

124
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,600
This is a surprise! You guys can also perform miraculous acts?!

125
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,840
What do you mean by that?

126
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,840
We're alchemists.

127
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,930
We're the Elric brothers. 
Our reputation is fairly widespread.

128
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,940
Alchemists?

129
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,060
Then it wasn't a miracle?

130
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,270
I've never heard of any alchemists around these parts.

131
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,900
He's the Fullmetal Alchemist, Edward Elric.

132
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,240
You're famous around East City.

133
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,360
Said to be an alchemist prodigy.

134
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,220
Incredible!

135
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,300
So that's it!

136
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,640
So this is why your 
nickname is "Fullmetal"!

137
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,900
Are you really that famous? Yeah?

138
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,980
Um, not me...

139
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,400
Huh?

140
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,630
You mean the little guy there?

141
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,720
Who are you calling a bean sprout, too tiny to even notice?!

142
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,140
Nobody called you that!

143
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,890
Things sure are bustling today!

144
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,350
Oh, Rose!

145
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,860
My, I haven't seen these folks around.

146
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,550
I'm Alphonse Elric.

147
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:37,620
And I'm the Fullmetal Alchemist, his older brother, Edward Elric.

148
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,330
Oh my, <i>you're</i> the older brother?

149
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,290
Now, now...

150
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,150
Rose, are you already done shopping for your offering?

151
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,120
Yes.

152
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,800
In that case, take these two along with you to the Church of Leto.

153
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,840
They say they're looking for something, so they could ask for God's grace.

154
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,760
Oh, but we don't...

155
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,240
It's all right. There are 
pilgrim's quarters there too.

156
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,100
Please, make your stay there.

157
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,380
Yeah, but...

158
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,170
Really? In that case, let's take them up on it, okay, Al?

159
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,510
O-Okay.

160
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,500
Rose sure has gotten 
a lot more cheerful, huh?

161
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,830
Yeah. That's thanks to the Minister.

162
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,710
Especially after what happened.

163
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,420
Al...

164
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,940
That woman at the shop earlier...

165
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,000
Have we ever seen her before?

166
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,720
Hmm...

167
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,930
It'll be okay!

168
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,020
I'm sure you'll soon find what you're looking for.

169
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,270
And what's more...

170
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,360
If you pray, I'm sure you'll grow taller!

171
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,550
What did you say?!

172
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,300
Don't go making fun of me!

173
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,300
I'm sorry!

174
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,810
Hey, wait up!

175
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,810
Brother...

176
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,910
Pray in faith, that thy entreaties may be accorded thee.

177
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,450
May all of his children 
receive the grace of his light,

178
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,920
both today and tomorrow.

179
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,120
Nicely done, Minister.

180
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,570
Thank you so much for your favorable words today.

181
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,220
Minister...

182
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,600
Oh, Rose.

183
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,350
Um, may I put some travelers up 
in the pilgrim's quarters?

184
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,150
You seem to do all you can each day for God, huh?

185
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,880
Yes. I serve the Lord Leto always.

186
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,970
That's why...

187
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,260
God sees your good works.

188
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,790
The reason your miracle has not occurred is that the time is still a little too short.

189
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,550
Right...

190
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,880
Huh? You say that's the grave of Rose-san's beloved?

191
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,580
Without anyone to rely on, and having lost her boyfriend in an accident,

192
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,270
Rose-san clings to 
Minister Cornello's teachings.

193
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,660
When all the while, there's no way the dead can come back to life.

194
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,510
They <i>do</i> appear to come back.

195
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,640
As the living are given an immortal soul,

196
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,740
so are the dead given resurrection.

197
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,610
The testament is in the 
miraculous works, they say.

198
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,280
Sounds fishy.

199
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,180
What do you think?

200
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,140
There's no two ways about it. 
That metamorphic reaction must be alchemy.

201
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,600
It sure is. But still, the laws—

202
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,310
Oh, it's you two!

203
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,480
What do you think about 
Cornello-sama's miraculous works?

204
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,000
No matter how you slice it, 
that's alchemy.

205
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,360
This Cornello guy is just a swindling bastard.

206
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,850
That's not entirely established. 
We just know that he's ignoring the laws.

207
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,830
The laws?

208
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,600
Alchemy isn't the creation of something out of nothing.

209
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,210
It's a scientific technique, 
which obeys the laws of nature.

210
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,720
You can only get something out of another thing of the same mass.

211
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,720
It's like how I could only make a radio that was the same size as before.

212
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,850
I couldn't make it a bigger radio,

213
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,690
or change it into a piece of paper, or a tree, or something.

214
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:37,260
It's how, if you want to obtain something, you need something of equal value.

215
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,880
But the old guy up there is disregarding that.

216
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,690
It's like I've been saying, 
they're miracles!

217
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,290
Can you bring about 
such a miracle using alchemy?

218
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,300
And Cain will soon be...

219
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,050
The Elric brothers?

220
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:09,080
I heard that the older brother received the 
title of State Alchemist when he was twelve.

221
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,140
He's called the Fullmetal Alchemist.

222
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,100
That little brat?!

223
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,140
He's a dog of the military.

224
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,080
The military has cast their gaze upon our bountiful town here, and plans to intervene.

225
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,050
The people—my children—must be saved.

226
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,400
Cray...

227
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,830
I shall carry out the will of God.

228
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,910
I am grateful to you for 
bringing this to my attention.

229
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,420
Just having that boy here is troubling, huh?

230
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,130
There is still one other way, 
just in case.

231
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,080
Just by serving God so dutifully,

232
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,390
someone who is dead will 
come back to life at some point?

233
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,400
Yes, absolutely.

234
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:11,490
Water, 35 liters; carbon, 20 kilograms; ammonia, 4 liters; lime, 1.5 kilograms;

235
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:18,660
phosphorus, 800 grams; salt, 250 grams; saltpeter, 100 grams; sulfur, 80 grams;

236
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,730
fluorine, 7.5 grams; 
iron, 5 grams; silicon, 3 grams;

237
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,090
and a small amount of 
fifteen other elements.

238
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,010
What's that?

239
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,090
That is the material makeup of a single average adult human body if you were to calculate it.

240
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,490
Despite being able to know 
this much through science,

241
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:39,400
there's never been a successful reported case of anyone actually transmuting a human body.

242
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,360
For several centuries, scientists have been researching what it is that's missing.

243
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,280
Their efforts are more worthwhile than just praying and waiting around, wouldn't you say?

244
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,420
By the way, all of these ingredients

245
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,280
can be bought at a market with the spare change any child might have.

246
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,600
Humans can be made for cheap, you see.

247
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,920
People aren't things! 
Would you blaspheme God?!

248
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,170
Alchemists are scientists,

249
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:09,170
so God is something ambiguous, which we don't believe in.

250
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,510
It's ironic, since we're the ones who are closest to being gods.

251
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,100
You are not a god!

252
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,100
Neither is the sun. 
It's just a very hot mass of stuff.

253
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,710
If you get too close to the sun, 
all you do is burn up.

254
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,450
Jeez, Brother, you're just getting Rose-san upset at you.

255
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,490
Don't worry. Your brother 
will be coming with you soon.

256
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,920
Disciple Cray! 
What are you doing?!

257
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,050
They are enemies of God!

258
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,100
All of this is God's will!

259
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,680
Ah, you startled me!

260
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,390
My head!

261
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,100
Stee-rike!

262
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,580
What's going on here?! His head...

263
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,860
It's nothing.

264
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,610
This is how I am.

265
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,110
There's nothing inside him!

266
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:17,780
You could call this the punishment I got 
for setting foot on holy ground,

267
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,620
which as a person, I should never 
have encroached upon. Both me...

268
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,330
and my brother.

269
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,210
Rose!

270
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,420
<i>It's true! It's just like the Minister said!</i>

271
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,090
<i>Those two are enemies of God!</i>

272
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,230
No one ever told us 
about this place.

273
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,110
Rose!

274
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,110
How good of you to 
bring them here, Rose.

275
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,660
A State Alchemist, huh? I had a feeling you would come here sooner or later.

276
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,040
Is that because you're a swindler who deceives his believers? Or instead...

277
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,710
Is it because you possess the Philosopher's Stone?

278
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,550
You mean this?

279
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,200
Transmuting without drawing any transmutation circles

280
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,400
while disregarding the
Law of Equivalent Exchange...

281
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,080
There could be only one answer.

282
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,490
Quite so.

283
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:27,820
The enchanted sorcery amplifier, said to exist only in legend—

284
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,480
the Philosopher's Stone!

285
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,190
I've been looking for that.

286
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,660
I'll get right to the point. 
Hand over the Philosopher's Stone.

287
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,030
Do that, and I won't say a thing to the people in town.

288
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:43,340
You mean to deprive me of this?

289
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,710
If my miraculous works cease, 
what would become of this town?

290
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,490
Right, Rose?

291
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,700
Rose! That guy is just 
a third-rate con man!

292
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,220
I returned life to this town, just as it was about to crumble from internal strife.

293
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,280
I created water and turned it into wine,

294
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,930
built buildings, and even 
gave money to the people.

295
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,340
I am the representative of God!

296
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:13,230
Do you intend to deprive the 
people of this city of their God?

297
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:16,070
Is that how absolute the 
orders of the military are?

298
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,580
I couldn't care less 
about military orders.

299
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,320
What?

300
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,200
I need...

301
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
We need that thing!

302
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,410
Why?!

303
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,420
Why, even knowing it will rob us of hope, are you still after it?

304
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,920
Rose, we're going to—

305
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,630
It's no use.

306
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:41,390
Now then, why don't we have a look at the power of the Philosopher's Stone?

307
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,350
Al!

308
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,220
Your armor has turned against you, huh?

309
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,070
You can't very well draw a transmutation circle in that sand, either.

310
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,840
Using the Philosopher's Stone, 
you synthesized a kindred life form?

311
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,340
Yes, a Chimera!

312
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,300
It looks like...

313
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,550
taking him on barehanded...

314
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,560
is going to be...

315
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,060
tough!

316
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,570
What?! You transmuted without using a transmutation circle?!

317
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,870
Go get him!

318
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,180
How do you like that?!

319
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,310
Just kidding.

320
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,490
You're not getting away!

321
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,980
What's the matter, 
you pussy bastard?

322
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,840
Get yourself a good taste.

323
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,140
Gluttony, that boy...

324
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,110
I-Impossible!

325
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,030
How could his claws not tear through your leg?

326
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,530
Or his fangs crush your arm?

327
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,240
Don't tell me you're...

328
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
Yeah, that's right.

329
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,160
Rose, take a good look.

330
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,920
This is the body of one who performs a human transmutation...

331
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,420
of one who encroaches upon God or whoever's territory.

332
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,010
This is what happens to such transgressors!

333
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:29,620
A mechanical... arm and leg? Automail?

334
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,800
You performed human transmutation?!

335
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,600
You've committed that 
which is most sanctioned!

336
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,110
You've had your bodies 
taken over to the other side!

337
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,110
<i>If you get too close to the sun, 
all you do is burn up.</i>

338
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:48,820
So this is why your title is "Fullmetal"!

339
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,740
The Fullmetal Alchemist!

340
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,500
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

341
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,500
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

342
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,500
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

344
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,970
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

345
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,970
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

346
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,970
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

347

00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:08,180
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

349
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:08,180
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

350
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:08,180
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

351
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:08,180
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

352
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,970
