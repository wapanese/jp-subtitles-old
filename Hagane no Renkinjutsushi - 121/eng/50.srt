1
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,320
What city is this?

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,590
<i>Who are you?</i>

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,330
<i>Who are you?</i>

4
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,340
Is this not my own body?

5
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,790
Machines that can fly that freely through the sky?

6
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,030
Apparently, in this world,

7
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,950
mechanical technology 
developed instead of alchemy.

8
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,070
That's why there are machines here 
that we cannot comprehend.

9
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,550
"This world"?

10
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,050
Didn't you realize?

11
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,060
This place...

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,820
is the other side of the gate.

13
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,490
The Philosopher's Stone.

14
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:51,640
Those who obtain it are set free from the Law of Equivalent Exchange.

15
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,550
There is no need to pay a price 
in order to obtain something, either.

16
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,130
We sought it and found it.

17
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,020
The reason I want to spit these creaky old memories out

18
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,020
kishinda omoi o hakidashitai no wa

19
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,800
The reason I want to spit these creaky old memories out

20
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,800
kishinda omoi o hakidashitai no wa

21
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,190
is because I don't have any other proof of my existence

22
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,190
sonzai no shoumei ga hoka ni nai kara

23
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,540
The future that I thought I had grabbed hold of

24
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,540
tsukanda hazu no boku no mirai wa

25
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:34,040
is a contradiction of dignity and freedom

26
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:34,040
'songen' to 'jiyuu' de mujun shiteru yo

27
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:44,640
The reason I want to wipe away this distorted afterimage

28
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:44,640
yuganda zanzou o keshisaritai no wa

29
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,730
is because I see my own limitations within it

30
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,730
jibun no genkai o soko ni miru kara

31
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,030
is because I see my own limitations within it

32
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,030
jibun no genkai o soko ni miru kara

33
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:55,390
In the window of my overly self-conscious self

34
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:55,390
jiishikikajou na boku no mado ni wa

35
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:55,650
is last year's calendar, without any dates written in

36
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:55,650
kyonen no calendar, hizuke ga nai yo

37
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,700
is last year's calendar, without any dates written in

38
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,700
kyonen no calendar, hizuke ga nai yo

39
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,620
I'll erase it and rewrite it

40
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,620
keshite rewrite shite

41
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,240
with nonsensical surrealism

42
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,240
kudaranai chougensou

43
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,090
and an unforgettable sense of presence

44
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,090
wasurarenu sonzaikan o

45
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:16,300
Return from the brink of death, and rewrite it

46
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:16,300
kishikaisei rewrite shite

47
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,000
Even meaningless figments of imagination

48
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,000
imi no nai souzou mo

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,200
can be the driving force that gives you form

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,200
kimi o nasu gendouryoku

51
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,460
Give your whole body and soul to me

52
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,460
zenshinzenrei o kure yo

53
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,030
Death

54
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,030
Death

55
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,290
It sounds like something has happened at the Central Command Center.

56
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,090
There's a lot of confusion, 
and I couldn't make out any details.

57
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,330
No matter.

58
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,600
We'll be able to hold out well enough against the ragtag soldiers

59
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,760
that Major General Hakuro 
has scraped together, at least.

60
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,770
And as long as the Colonel realizes his dream during that period, everything will be fine.

61
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,150
Now that I think about it, 
we've been fairly dumb, too.

62
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,690
We only vaguely know 
what the Colonel is up to.

63
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,780
Lt. Colonel!

64
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,860
Reinforcements!

65
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,280
I'll go.

66
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,870
At this point, I'm not impersonating the Colonel anymore, right?

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,150
Something the matter?

68
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,100
No.

69
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,600
Was there something different that you wanted?

70
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,860
We won't tell your mother.

71
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,530
Come on, 
I'll get you one more thing.

72
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,960
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,130
I saw you.

74
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,180
Is your treasure in there, Father?

75
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,690
I was going to give it to you when you were a little more grown up.

76
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,430
Really?

77
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,690
Hold on to this 
for me until then.

78
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,750
I'm entrusting my life to you.

79
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,970
Be sure to guard it well.

80
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,000
Yes, sir, Your Excellency!

81
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,330
What's wrong?

82
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,920
The men outside said that 
they saw someone suspicious!

83
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,870
Lieutenant Hawkeye, isn't it?

84
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,390
I'm honored that you remember me, 
Your Excellency.

85
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,600
Around the front!

86
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,900
Move around to the front! Hurry!

87
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,730
Now!

88
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,440
Let's go.

89
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,130
But where to?

90
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,970
Our friends are planning to stage a wholesale uprising.

91
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,370
We're going there.

92
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,980
Bad news!

93
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,930
What's wrong?

94
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,480
Th-There was a communiqué...

95
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,200
The Führer's residence...

96
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,330
Your Excellency,

97
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,180
I'm on my way.

98
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,000
This world is filled with death.

99
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,060
They've even used a gas that takes 
a great number of lives here in this world.

100
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,220
In the future, people will die 
even more efficiently.

101
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,970
You saw it too, didn't you?

102
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,830
All of those lives, 
spanning past to future,

103
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,900
become the source of our alchemy.

104
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,830
The source? What are you 
talking about? Alchemy is...

105
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,360
Equivalent exchange?

106
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,650
But in order to return a broken radio 
back to the way it was,

107
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,850
you need more than just 
the same amount of mass.

108
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,500
You also need the energy it takes to reconstruct it.

109
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,950
You cannot have an equivalent exchange that ignores that.

110
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:08,470
The lives of those who die in this world 
pass through the gate

111
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,810
and provide the energy for our alchemy. Is that what you're saying?

112
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,510
We all have a small gate, right here.

113
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,650
Alchemists open this gate,

114
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,080
and from there, 
they connect to this world

115
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,810
and exploit those lives 
to obtain power.

116
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,190
Then you <i>are</i> in league 
with that woman after all!

117
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,990
No such thing as 
equivalent exchange, huh?!

118
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,800
She said the same thing!

119
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,530
You've met Dante, have you?

120
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:37,140
I saw the love letter you sent her, too. The one from four hundred years ago!

121
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,220
You two have prolonged your lives by taking over other bodies!

122
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:41,910
Isn't that right?!

123
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,420
Why did you marry Mom?

124
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,790
Did you just want to see how fun it would be to have children like regular people do?

125
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,880
I loved her.

126
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,640
I loved your mom—Trisha.

127
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,930
It was the first time 
I knew love.

128
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,640
You're lying!

129
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,510
Then why didn't you...?!

130
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,480
I didn't want you to see this decaying body.

131
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,950
Eat him.

132
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,540
Make him a complete Stone inside you.

133
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,000
Go on, snap to it.

134
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,680
Lust... What happened to Lust?

135
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,440
Lust! Lust!

136
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,310
What's the matter with you?! Eat him right now!

137
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,520
Let me see his son 
gurgling away inside of you!

138
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,700
Dammit, I wanted to 
tear the runt to pieces, too!

139
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,190
Lust...

140
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,490
Lust... Lust...

141
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,660
I'm sorry.

142
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,740
I know it was sudden.

143
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,400
Gluttony?

144
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,260
Be careful. Right now, 
he possesses nothing but his appetite.

145
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,840
He was originally going to be the homunculus I used to refine red water.

146
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,000
He doesn't need a mind.

147
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,340
Dante cannot create a 
Philosopher's Stone by herself.

148
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,570
That's why I always 
kept myself in hiding.

149
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,890
But once I learned she had set her sights on you...

150
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,380
Were you sent through the gate by Dante too?

151
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,690
Dante separated my soul, mind, and body within the gate

152
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,790
and probably thinks 
I am wandering around.

153
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,390
But I was able to 
get through the gate.

154
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,960
What about this body?

155
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,540
This world differs from ours on the point of the development of alchemy

156
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,870
but is otherwise 
almost identical to ours.

157
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,350
That's why there's a child here who is identical to you.

158
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,040
There's probably a boy out there 
identical to Al too.

159
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,320
So that's why you were living next to this boy?

160
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,880
Your body is still 
inside the gate.

161
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,000
Your soul and mind must be all that were drawn over

162
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,200
to dwell within 
this Edward's body.

163
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,840
General Churchill said he needed to see you.

164
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,720
Hold on!

165
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,800
Open the gate within you.

166
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,230
Find your own body 
within the gate.

167
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,510
You're coming back too, 
aren't you?!

168
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,360
I cannot go back.

169
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,910
My body has already 
passed through the gate.

170
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,310
I cannot use alchemy in this world.

171
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,570
But there's still time for you.

172
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,120
I'll come up with something!

173
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,810
I am going to die here, 
in this body,

174
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,760
with the face and form 
that Trisha loved.

175
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:23,050
I am relieved to know that 
equivalent exchange is not true.

176
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,350
You don't necessarily need to pay a price 
in order to obtain something.

177
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,980
When a parent loves their child, there can be no cost or reward.

178
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,890
Even so, if I stick with it, 
I can still obtain something.

179
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,220
Anyone who makes an effort will be fairly rewarded.

180
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,340
If you pay the price, you can acquire an equal happiness.

181
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,540
That's the kind of equivalent exchange I'd like to believe in.

182
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,530
Reality...

183
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,850
Reality isn't like that.

184
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,580
So if you say it's a childish theory, then I'm fine with being a child.

185
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,390
I don't want to think that you could go unrewarded after paying a price.

186
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,530
There's a zeppelin coming down.

187
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,480
Brigadier General Mustang?

188
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,320
He's supposed to be with you, at the northern front.

189
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,520
That is an impostor.

190
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,670
He is in Central and is after the Führer's life.

191
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,750
It could be a rat. 
This <i>is</i> an old house.

192
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,750
Just to be sure, 
I'll go have a look.

193
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,180
You guys watch after my family.

194
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:20,960
But...

195
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,220
In case anything happens, 
take them to the command center.

196
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,710
My family is more important to me than my life.

197
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,060
I knew you would come alone.

198
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,960
Is this the first time 
you have betrayed my trust?

199
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,600
You're the one 
who betrayed us first.

200
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:11,160
You mean my being a homunculus?

201
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,230
Whether or not you are human 
is no great matter.

202
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,270
Then does it even matter?

203
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:26,710
Since I have become Führer, I have eliminated other races through recurring wars

204
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,550
and have continued to expand our territory.

205
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:33,510
But all of it was so that you could create a Philosopher's Stone.

206
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:40,450
Those who have been made desperate by war 
seek the Philosopher's Stone.

207
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,380
People are fools.

208
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,240
And you have those foolish people 
make Philosopher's Stones, do you?

209
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:54,120
And then we take the Philosopher's Stones from you, saving you from ruin.

210
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,850
You could say that 
we are God's apostles.

211
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,560
There is no God!

212
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,810
That may be so. 
However, there <i>are</i> devils:

213
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,020
you alchemists!

214
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,230
Too bad.

215
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:17,780
The explosive force of an open space 
does not compare to that of a closed space.

216
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,120
Though I'm sure that the great Flame Alchemist 
was already aware of that.

217
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,540
I can see air currents!

218
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,380
That's how I realized that 
this cave had been closed up!

219
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,580
Very soon, you will become me.

220
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,920
Envy!

221
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,960
You can't let him use alchemy.

222
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,270
You dumbass!

223
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:14,010
Bring my... Bring my mama back to life!

224
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,260
Naughty boy.

225
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,290
Right now, the Philosopher's Stone 
has been activated to its maximum level.

226
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,340
If you were to use alchemy here,

227
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,820
the transmutation would be started, 
don't you know.

228
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,230
And here I let you live because 
I thought you were still of use to me.

229
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,210
The gate...

230
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,210
The gate...

231
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,970
It's still here!

232
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:03,720
Ed!

233
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,980
Brother!

234
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:10,890
Al?

235
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,690
I'm back...

236
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,910
So that's it.

237
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,700
That other "me" over there died.

238
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,420
I've used yet another life 
from the other side, have I?

239
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,990
That was amazing, Edward-kun.

240
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,460
Doctor Marcoh?

241
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,370
Why are you here?

242
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,970
You know why, don't you?

243
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,840
Ed,

244
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,860
you're the one who turned Doctor Marcoh 
over to the Führer, aren't you?

245
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,470
There's no way 
he could be safe.

246
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,810
He's long since 
gone into his stomach.

247
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,810
It's as though you were the one who killed him.

248
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,610
And while we're at it, 
that goes for me too.

249
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,950
It must be difficult, 
fighting the faces of those you know.

250
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,090
Even though you've convinced yourself 
that it's not the real person!

251
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,320
Is that it?!

252
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,670
Is that the only power you've got?!

253
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,050
If so, I've got you beat!

254
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,300
I've already defeated 
many other homunculi.

255
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,450
I even defeated the one 
who looked like my mom.

256
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,800
At this point, no matter 
whose face you take on...

257
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,170
That's it.

258
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,810
Kill me right.

259
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,560
See? Hard, isn't it?

260
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,440
Don't do that, Edward.

261
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,300
You've got no right 
to order me around!

262
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,030
Makes no difference to me,

263
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,700
but there's no telling what will happen to your brother.

264
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,930
The Philosopher's Stone has been activated.

265
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,910
If a transmutation were to occur around him, then I'm sure...

266
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,250
...you know what will happen.

267
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,630
Don't get too full of yourself!

268
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,640
It's no use! 
I'm stronger, after all!

269
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,070
Why, you!

270
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,310
Don't, Ed!

271
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,610
Stop messing with me!

272
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,070
Edward-kun!

273
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,250
Ed...

274
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,030
Fullmetal! Are you trying to kill me?!

275
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,540
That face is the easiest one 
for me to hit!

276
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,870
Show me your real face!

277
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:35,240
Is using other people's faces 
and taking advantage of others

278
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,270
the only thing you can do?!

279
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,550
You want to see it that badly?

280
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,800
Show it to me, if you can!

281
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,800
I'll show you!

282
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,190
What's the matter? 
You wanted to see it, didn't you?

283
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,320
Dad?

284
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:07,100
Envy was the first homunculus, 
created when Hohenheim was still young.

285
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,330
The boy that he had with me at the time 
died from mercury poisoning.

286
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,560
He tried to bring him back to life somehow, but he failed.

287
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,200
And then he abandoned me.

288
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,840
You can understand...

289
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,050
why I hate him, right?

290
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,770
Brother?

291
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,700
Ed...

292
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:52,550
Ed!

293
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,710
Ed!

294
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:14,260
As my tears well up,

295
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:14,260

00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,430

00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,540

Stay... stay... stay... stay...

00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:42,720
It's true, I cannot see you now,

307
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,820
