1
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:13,200
The military swarmed into this city, which had lost its priest and had fallen into disorder,

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,900
and attacked the citizens here, 
trying to gain control militarily.

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,280
You were the one who created the opportunity for them to do that, were you not?

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,120
The people of Liore are ethnically very similar to Ishbal.

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,880
The folks at Central

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,540
must not have thought of them as being the same kind of people as themselves.

7
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,220
That is not true!

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,190
I am going to complete 
the Philosopher's Stone

9
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,480
for the sake of all people 
who suffer under tyranny.

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,470
Wait...

11
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,230
Wait!

12
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,140
This one is on a whole other level 
compared with the ones Tucker was creating.

13
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,200
Is this the legacy of 
the 5th Laboratory?

14
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:27,420
All of these things were known to you 
and Colonel Archer, weren't they, Major?

15
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,020
What the hell are you guys hiding? We've had enough already.

16
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,570
Please stop!

17
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,670
Al-kun...

18
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,900
Major Armstrong doesn't have anything to do with this.

19
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,400
<i>I'm</i> the one who was 
harboring Martel-san.

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,580
Wh-What are you talking about, 
Alphonse-kun?

21
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,340
There is something that 
I've come to understand.

22
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,650
I can't say anything 
about it now,

23
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,670
but please, everyone, 
no more fighting.

24
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,880
Please, don't fight.

25
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,440
Major, I know that you're trying to carry on where Hughes left off.

26
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,440
"You can just make your way to the top without having to know about anything."

27
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,900
"I will investigate what's happening behind the scenes myself."

28
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,450
Isn't that right?

29
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,160
I'm terribly sorry. 
Right now, I'm not...

30
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,300
Al!

31
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,550
Martel-san!

32
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,550
Al, listen to me, and tell Ed, too!

33
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,670
Whatever, just get inside me!

34
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,100
Al, listen...

35
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,600
Martel-san, what on earth is it?

36
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Liore is going to be 
turned into another Ishbal!

37
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,110
What do you mean?

38
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,610
That man—the Führer—

39
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,190
is a homunculus!

40
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,620
Far away, far away, our dreams will never fade

41
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,620
tooku tooku omoi hatenaku

42
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,920
If only the two of us could go back to

43
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,920
futari ga mujaki ni waratteta

44
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,770
the days when we laughed so innocently

45
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,770
ano koro ni modoreru nara

46
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:25,870
the days when we laughed so innocently

47
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:25,870
ano koro ni modoreru nara

48
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,700
Just like glassware

49
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,700
konagona ni kudaketa

50
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:40,300
that has been smashed to pieces,

51
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:40,300
glass-zaiku no you na

52
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:48,090
we're putting together the fragments of our memories

53
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:48,090
omoide no kakera o atsumeteru

54
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,880
It's the important things that you notice

55
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,880
daiji na mono wa itsudatte

56
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,700
It's the important things that you notice

57
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,700
daiji na mono wa itsudatte

58
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:59,450
once you've lost them

59
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:59,450
nakushite kara kizuku yo

60
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:06,700
Oh, please, oh, please, stop time for me,

61
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:06,700
douka douka jikan o tomete

62
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,280
and engrave the way you look right now into my heart

63
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,280
kimi no omokage o kono mune ni kizandekure

64
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,830
And if, and if, I were ever allowed to,

00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,830
moshimo moshimo yurusareru nara

66
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,240
I would be willing to sacrifice everything

67
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,240
subete o gisei ni shitemo ii

68
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,890
just to see that smiling face one more time

69
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,890
ano egao o mou ichido

70
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,000
Holy Mother

71
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,000
Holy Mother

72
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,510
The military wants to 
have a just cause!

73
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:46,830
That cause being that ultimately, the town of Liore 
was the one who first attacked the military,

74
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,970
and thus they had no choice but to massacre us!

75
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,070
Lure the military in 
without offering resistance!

76
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,640
When that happens, the wrath of God 
will rain down upon them!

77
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,120
It's pretty bad taste to prop up 
a mute woman as a holy mother.

78
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,650
Rose-san is the one 
who gave us courage!

79
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,630
She's the one who told us

80
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,320
that we can stand under our own power, not by the god Leto, or the military!

81
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,510
It's all the same if it means you're still following somebody else, you know!

82
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,600
What?!

83
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,080
They can't help it. 
We humans are so weak, after all.

84
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,990
Lyra, is that perfume?

85
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes. I haven't had 
a chance to bathe, you see.

86
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,500
I don't like that smell.

87
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,500
Never mind that, 
what are you going to do?

88
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,120
That should be obvious.

89
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,530
You think I can turn a blind eye to what Scar is doing now?

90
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,920
I suppose not.

91
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,600
If this keeps up, there are going to be casualties among the townspeople.

92
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,980
He says he's going to use the inbound military

93
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,860
as ingredients to transmute his Philosopher's Stone. But if that fails...

94
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,020
And here I thought that 
maybe you admired Scar.

95
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,030
We both feel the same way about wanting to protect the city.

96
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,900
Lyra, I need a favor.

97
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,410
Please, I need you to hear me out.

98
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,530
It's Alphonse.

99
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,820
He came from Liore.

100
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,800
He brought a letter 
addressed to me.

101
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,630
It's from Brother? 
Then he's safe, right?

102
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,310
Yes. According to Ed-kun's letter,

103
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,820
Scar has turned the whole town into a transmutation circle.

104
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,810
He also says that by no means are we to enter the town.

105
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,350
I wonder if they're planning

106
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,320
to lure the military in and use them as ingredients for the Philosopher's Stone...

107
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,070
How do you mean?

108
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,080
The ingredients for a 
Philosopher's Stone are live humans.

109
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,880
And a very large 
number of them, at that.

110
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,550
Y-You don't mean...

111
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,050
So that's the truth behind the 5th Laboratory, huh?

112
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,760
Then the higher-ups within the military were sanctioning human experimentation...

113
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,270
Al, you're heading to Liore.

114
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,790
If they're together, 
you should meet up with Ed.

115
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,770
Right. But...

116
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,670
If we leave them alone, 
Liore will surrender in time.

117
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,780
Arresting Scar after that happens will be good enough.

118
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,010
Understood.

119
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,280
Al-kun...

120
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,030
This is Ed-kun's. 
The Major just returned it to us.

121
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,650
You fools, who defy the military,

122
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,110
away with you!

123
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,700
Animals that can talk? 
You must be confused!

124
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,950
Chimeras. It's them, all right.

125
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,220
What's more, they said 
there was a man who could

126
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,080
suddenly create explosions with just his touch.

127
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,920
What?

128
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,080
Is something the matter?

129
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,330
Those guys are just a diversion.

130
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,090
The main enemy forces will 
definitely be invading afterward.

131
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:55,060
As planned, we will draw them into the city, 
without offering any resistance.

132
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,680
Before that happens, you're going to escape through that passageway.

133
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,860
I am going to go dispose of the enemy, who has come here as a diversion.

134
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,680
You have an obligation to 
make sure they get away safely.

135
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,320
Yeah, okay.

136
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,860
Let's go, Rose, Lyra.

137
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,920
You're being a pretty 
good loser, huh?

138
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,420
If that letter has arrived, then the military won't be coming in for the time being.

139
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,200
If Scar can't get the ingredients for his Philosopher's Stone,

140
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,830
then nothing is going to happen.

141
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,400
All I can do

142
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,790
is get you away to someplace 
where the military can't reach you.

143
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,990
Liore is going to fall under military command.

144
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,470
If you have to blame someone, 
blame me.

145
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:59,410
I can't overturn 
the military's decision.

146
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,180
Look at that!

147
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,690
Seven thousand troops total, 
all gathered together.

148
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,690
It would be possible for us to crush Liore right now!

149
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,150
Now, hold on.

150
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,280
Table the attack for now.

151
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,270
What?!

152
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,460
According to the letter that Colonel Mustang received,

153
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,900
the Fullmetal Alchemist appears to still be safe.

154
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,740
Liore may be preparing for a dialogue between us.

155
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,740
There is no possibility of that now!

156
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,970
Still, we cannot very well 
invade the city without just cause.

157
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,470
Pride,

158
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,420
what do you mean, 
delaying the assault?

159
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,100
Do you have some complaint, Lust?

160
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,730
Scar is lying in wait 
for the military to invade.

161
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:15,030
He intends to use those lives to 
transmute the Philosopher's Stone.

162
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,230
So why don't you send 
the military in right now?

163
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,740
I am under orders 
from you-know-who.

164
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,460
I do not know 
what is being considered,

165
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,830
but that person's word is absolute.

166
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,490
Lust...

167
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,470
I cannot accept that.

168
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,810
If Scar is going to create a Philosopher's Stone,

169
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,030
then I am going to help him.

170
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:39,090
Are you sure you don't embrace any wasted feelings for Scar?

171
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,310
We are allowed to live 
because of that person.

172
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,660
Do not forget that.

173
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,970
Which is precisely the reason

174
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,110
why we have been seeking the Philosopher's Stone.

175
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,730
I am going to Liore once again.

176
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,110
Get the military moving as soon as you can.

177
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,610
Gluttony?

178
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,360
But... you-know-who said...

179
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,220
Is fleeing all you can do?

180
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,760
The Ishbalans, who had the 
same color of skin that you do,

181
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,680
were a bit more 
challenging than you are.

182
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,310
Maybe I was expecting too much from them.

183
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,760
After all that we've done, I thought 
they would be fighting back by now,

184
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,700
but I guess we haven't killed enough of them.

185
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,030
So, it <i>is</i> you,

186
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,910
Crimson Alchemist.

187
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,360
And you are?

188
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,130
Ah, I remember.

189
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:00,170
That scar is one of 
my best works.

190
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,760
What's with your right arm?

191
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,490
Of all the State Alchemists 
whom I kill,

192
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,150
you will be the last!

193
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,150
What?!

194
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,740
Damn!

195
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,790
That right arm... I get it. 
It's just like that one time,

196
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,840
when my red stone was taken.

197
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,080
Feed me as many as you like!

198
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,220
I will take that cursed red light...

199
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:51,970
and transmute it into a 
Philosopher's Stone within me!

200
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,620
Why do we have to 
leave the city?

201
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,480
Let's fight!

202
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,100
No! This is the will 
of the Holy Mother.

203
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,990
Rose, what will you do if Scar-san 
does not come, even after we've fled?

204
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,490
Without the Philosopher's Stone, 
we cannot fight.

205
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,740
Cut it out, Lyra.

206
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,630
I'll negotiate with the military.

207
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,580
Somehow or other...

208
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,760
I can't put any trust into that.

209
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,310
We all have to split up and run away in all directions right now.

210
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,840
And then, make our appeals from cities all over.

211
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,330
Tell everyone 
what happened in Liore,

212
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,840
what happened in Ishbal in the past, and of the tyranny of the military.

213
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,570
It'll just become another story.

214
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:34,800
Yet another city tried to create a Philosopher's Stone and was destroyed.

215
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,830
Rose, Lyra, you guys 
get out of here too!

216
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,900
I've been waiting for you

217
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,010
and the rest of my body.

218
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,130
You're... Sensei's...

219
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,010
It's Wrath.

220
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,890
Call me Wrath!

221
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,650
Rose! You idiot, stay back!

222
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,310
Shut up.

223
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,420
Shut up!

224
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,170
Dammit!

225
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,930
Rose! Get out of here!

226
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,240
You're just being used by Scar!

227
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,910
You don't have to die for him!

228
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,960
Get going!

229
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,240
I know you guys' weakness.

230
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,740
Greed told me.

231
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,220
When you guys come in contact

232
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,100
with the bones or other remains of 
the one whose human transmutation

233
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,750
was the subject of an attempt at reanimation, 
you become unable to move.

234
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,740
You guys are impostors.

235
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,470
That's why you cower 
when faced with the real thing.

236
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,450
In that case, 
I don't have a weakness.

237
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:39,100
I was transmuted with the remains of my own body as ingredients, after I was stillborn.

238
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,300
My real body is 
nowhere to be found.

239
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,060
But if it were,

240
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,820
it would be your body!

241
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,620
What?

242
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,160
Go to where 
all the others went!

243
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,040
Okay!

244
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,910
Are you sure 
you want to do this?

245
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,820
While you're chasing me around, 
the military could be on the move.

246
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,730
I am going to at least avenge my brother 
for what you did to him.

247
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,830
What foolishness. 
This is a fight over vengeance?

248
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,640
Then what is in this for you?

249
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,540
Nothing.

250
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,010
Nothing?

251
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,920
You killed that many of the 
Ishbalan people for nothing?!

252
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,840
To put it my own way,

253
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,740
if you alter a person just a little bit, 
they become nothing more than a bomb.

254
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,440
Humans aren't all that great.

255
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,060
You, me—we're all just 
meaningless things.

256
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,100
We're all hollow.

257
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,900
I might indeed be hollow...

258
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,290
but I am not meaningless.

259
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:28,110
Like I said, Alphonse Elric,

260
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,530
I am a State Alchemist, 
just like your brother is.

261
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,110
You're nothing more 
than a murderer.

262
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,620
Scar-san, please stop too. Where is my brother?

263
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,760
Stand aside, Alphonse Elric!

264
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,390
There has been 
enough bloodshed!

265
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,450
Can't you put an end 
to this now, Scar-san?

266
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,030
I did it, I did it!

267
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,880
Your arm has been 
superbly transmuted!

268
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,880
Can you hear that? 
The countdown to your death?

269
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:22,370
Your arm is slowly combining with 
the oxygen in the air, and before long...

270
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,810
Look closely, and see 
whether or not I am hollow...

271
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,820
This is what a real person looks like!

272
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,580
Scar-san!

273
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,280
Go to your brother.

274
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,520
I will do what you two could not.

275
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,020
What are red stones 
doing in his silver watch?!

276
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,230
I made a promise, didn't I?

277
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:22,240
That I was going to 
blow you up?

278
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,490
Alphonse!

279
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,180
Ah, you feel so good!

280
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,630
You should make for...

281
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,830
a magnificent bomb!

282
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,170
You... You're the Führer's...

283
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,890
Edward...

284
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,480
Why didn't you make me right?

285
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,590
E...d...

286
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,670
Give me back my body.

287
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,090
Give it back!

288
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,220
Shut up... Stop...

289
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,010
Make that thing shut up.

290
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,520
Shut up... Shut up...

291
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,030
Get up... and walk!

292
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,490
Shut up!

293
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,870
Move... forward!

294
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,950
Shut up!

295
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,450
Ed!

296
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
On the day you left,

297
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
On the day you left,

298
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330
kimi ga tabidatsu hi wa

299
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,330

300
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,620
I said good-bye and waved, like always

301
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,620
I said good-bye and waved, like always

302

itsumo to onaji 'jaa ne' to te o futta

303
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,620
itsumo to onaji 'jaa ne' to te o futta

304
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840
Almost as if I would see you again

305
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840
Almost as if I would see you again

306
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840

307
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840

I will be here with a smile as I look up at the stars,
