1
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,330
Come on, eat a little.

2
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,120
Eat and get your strength back!

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,300
Fine! Suit yourself!

4
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,700
How come I have to 
take care of this guy?

5
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,900
Say, does it still hurt anywhere?

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,340
Should I get some medicine?

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,350
How's his condition?

8
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,840
He won't listen to 
what we tell him!

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,600
We helped him out before, and then he ran off!

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,110
Those who carry Ishbalan blood 
are protected by our god, Ishbala.

11
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,750
Everything has happened by God's direction.

12
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,600
What's the matter? 
Aren't you going at it?

13
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,480
Of course I'm going.

14
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,800
That's the reason 
you hired me, after all.

15
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:23,890
I'll do my best to cut through their flesh 
and splatter their blood!

16
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,100
That's it, kill them! 
Leave no one alive!

17
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,780
Is God bestowing upon us 
yet another trial?

18
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,510
This is not the will of God.

19
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,220
This is the karmic doing of despicable men!

20
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,730
You mustn't! 
Not in your condition!

21
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,430
God!

22
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,860
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

23
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,460
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

24
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,510
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

25
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,000
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

Ready, steady, can't hold me back

27
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,490
Ready, steady, give me good luck

28
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,790
Ready, steady, never look back

29
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:51,190
Let's get started, ready, steady, go!

30
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,340

00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,510
Brother...

71
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,370
Earlier in Resembool, there was something you were about to tell me, remember?

72
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,060
Something you were too afraid to say to me till now.

73
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,240
It was that my soul and 
memories and everything

74
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,490
are really something fake that you came up with, wasn't it?

75
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,570
No! What Ed wanted 
to say to you was—

76
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,740
Never mind!

77
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,200
Is that all you have to say?

78
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,080
What about you, Brother?! Answer my question!

79
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,650
Why don't you say anything?! Why?!

80
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,260
Brother, why didn't you answer?

81
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,140
If I'm nothing more than memories that Brother made up,

82
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,780
what do I do now?

83
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,060
Really?

84
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,940
Yes. And then I told her...

85
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,380
My memories of being with Mom could be fake too.

86
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,670
Stop! Thief!

87
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,140
Hold it!

88
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,170
You sneaky thieves!

89
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,860
This way!

90
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,070
Hold it!

91
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,460
We made it!

92
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,580
Here, eat.

93
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,670
I don't want any! Stealing things from a store out of the blue—

94
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,710
if Mom knew we were doing this...

95
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,790
There, you see?

96
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,260
Take it easy on yourself.

97
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,000
You shouldn't steal other people's things.

98
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,260
What? This pile of junk spoke!

99
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,590
U-Um...

100
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,480
I'm not a pile of junk.

101
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,010
By any chance,

102
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,790
are you guys from Ishbal?

103
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,010
Um, excuse me...

104
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,020
Have you seen anyone like this?

105
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,100
Nope, I don't know 
anything about him.

106
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,680
I see.

107
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,590
Thank you.

108
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,460
Ed, in any event, we have to find Al and 
talk things over thoroughly with him, right?

109
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,210
Ed?

110
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,610
I'm scared.

111
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,180
I've wanted to ask Al 
something for so long...

112
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,500
but I'm afraid to 
talk to him about it.

113
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,750
About what?

114
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,250
He...

115
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,780
He... for me...

116
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,300
Still...

117
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:53,590
I think there are things you have to talk about, or you'll never know.

118
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,520
You must think it unusual that 
we'd be living in a place like this.

119
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,140
Not at all. I'm the one who 
followed along on my own.

120
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:27,590
No, no, I hear you looked after these children.

121
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,820
By the way, you have 
a most peculiar outfit on.

122
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,350
You can relax. 
He is not a military person.

123
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,350
Scar-san!

124
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,470
We meet again,

125
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,100
Alphonse Elric.

126
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,110
I'm surprised that 
you're here as well.

127
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,700
You two know each other?

128
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,410
Yeah...

129
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,200
somewhat.

130
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,230
In that case, this works out.

131
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:05,210
Visitor, I'd like for you 
not to tell anyone about us.

132
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,710
Th-That's fine.

133
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,610
I know about Ishbal myself.

134
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,970
But why has it come to this?

135
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,910
The military folks 
came and attacked us!

136
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,470
That's right.

137
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,530
In the past, they used every means 
they got their hands on to slaughter us.

138
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,190
But apparently, it wasn't enough.

139
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,350
I despise all State Alchemists.

140
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,700
If they're going to kill me, 
there's no better time than now.

141
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,940
You're injured.

142
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,700
What happened to your brother?

143
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,200
I don't care what happens to Brother.

144
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,460
Rick? What's wrong?

145
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,000
It's gone! Mom's locket!

146
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,860
What? That doesn't make any difference, does it?

147
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,970
Forget about it!

148
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,560
That's when I lost it!

149
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,810
H-Hey! Wait up!

150
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,310
See here! You cannot go outside again!

151
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,620
Rick! Leo!

152
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,050
I will bring them back.

153
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,200
Alphonse Elric, 
I don't know what happened,

154
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,760
but if you and your brother hate each other,

155
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,700
then it works out well for me.

156
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,740
Scar-san,

157
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,210
what do you think about me?

158
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,710
After talking to me, do you... do you sense anything?

159
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,220
I mean about me! In this body, do you think I'm human?

160
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,770
There they are!

161
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,870
No doubt about it. Ishbalans.

162
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,080
Rick, give up already!

163
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,620
Is this what you were looking for?

164
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,410
Yes?

165
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,940
Yes.

166
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,660
Yes. Understood.

167
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,130
Continue tailing them and locate their nest.

168
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,260
So, it's a memento 
of your late mother?

169
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,140
Uh-huh.

170
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,010
What's inside of it?

171
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,570
I don't know. It won't open. But that's okay.

172
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,860
Get rid of that thing!

173
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,620
No way!

174
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,160
You shouldn't talk that way 
about your mother's keepsake.

175
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,560
That woman... 
You call her a mother?

176
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,970
All she ever did was force religious precepts on us.

177
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,290
She was never once kind to us!

178
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,290
She was just thinking of what was best for you.

179
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:55,090
No! She didn't care 
what happened to us!

180
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,890
<i>What is this?</i>

181
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,940
<i>Does this boy want to forget his entire past?</i>

182
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,980
<i>That's the complete opposite of me.</i>

183
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:21,360
<i>I want to get my memories back. 
My real memories.</i>

184
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,930
You guys first.

185
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,580
Ah, hold on.

186
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,050
Okay, it's all right.

187
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,310
Wh-What's happening?

188
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,570
Bastard!

189
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,240
Let go of Rick!

190
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,020
Hold it!

191
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,150
Yes.

192
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,050
Yes. Yes.

193
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,310
Understood. Thanks.

194
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,300
Wait, Al-kun! Where are you?

195
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,260
What are you about to do?

196
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,850
So they're mercenaries, are they?

197
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,930
Apparently, they're using a military installation on the outskirts of town.

198
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,770
Rick should be there as well.

199
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:40,830
But still, Scar-san, are you sure 
this is all right? We're about to go fight.

200
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:44,450
Hey! Do you have a problem with us 
going together with you?!

201
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,990
No, I just...

202
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,750
The people of Ishbal value 
blood relations more than anything else.

203
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,540
If it means saving Rick, then they can have the life of this old fool!

204
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,560
That's right!

205
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,250
That is something important to the people of Ishbal.

206
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,050
But then...

207
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:04,700
our mom...

208
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,800
abandoned us!

209
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,640
A phone call from Al?!

210
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,770
Yes. It sounded like he'd stuck 
his nose into something strange.

211
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,630
On that horrendous day for Ishbal...

212
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:24,780
Mom was offering up prayers to Ishbala, 
just like she always did.

213
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,710
Hey, Rick...

214
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,700
I made up my mind.

215
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,150
There was no need for Rick to know about this.

216
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,450
I would protect Rick.

217
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,460
Over there.

218
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,970
We'll get a load of reward money from the military for this job!

219
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,800
We'll be able to take it easy for a while, huh?

220
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,240
We got one of the kids, just like we were told.

221
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,340
Can we be sure 
the group will be coming?

222
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,480
You know it. 
These folks are tightly united.

223
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,120
As long as we can lure out 
the armored guy and the scarred man...

224
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,230
An alchemist, huh?

225
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,330
Get him!

226
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,410
And there's the scarred man.

227
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,240
You guys take the armored guy. 
I'll take him.

228
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,650
Scar-san!

229
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:20,270
We meet again, Little Brother.

230
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,860
What are you doing here?

231
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:29,370
Don't go pulling out all the stops. 
After all, you don't exist.

232
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,200
You're just created memories.

233
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,100
I'll put you out of your misery!

234
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,410
Then you won't 
have to worry anymore

235
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,830
about whether or not 
your memories are real!

236
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,510
Stop!

237
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,250
Brother! Why are you here?!

238
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,770
What are you talking about, Al?!

239
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:03,480
It's obvious! We were worried sick 
and came looking for you!

240
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,360
Brother...

241
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,690
Fire!

242
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,300
Al! I've been too afraid 
to ask you for too long!

243
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:26,290
Do you blame me?! It's my fault that you wound up in that body!

244
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,850
B-Brother!

245
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,840
That's why... That's why I...

246
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,850
I was wondering...

247
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,430
if you blamed me.

248
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,430
Brother... That's what 
you wanted to say to me?

249
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,180
Al! Behind you!

250
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,180
Brother... How could I... How could I...

251
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,240
blame you?!

252
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,870
What?!

253
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,290
I'm still alive!

254
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,260
Apparently, even that fabled man can fail to kill someone when he's in enough pain.

255
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,700
Shoot him! Somebody get him!

256
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,100
Give up. 
You're the only one left now.

257
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,830
Who the hell are you?!

258
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,590
The same as you, 
a dog of the military.

259
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,090
A dog of the military? 
You're a State Alchemist?! Impossible!

260
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,280
This is a surprise.

261
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,750
You're a State Alchemist, huh?

262
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,810
Let me thank you.

263
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,640
For putting me in this body, that is!

264
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,150
You fool! Get off me!

265
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,340
Rick!

266
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,390
It can't be...!

267
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,930
Rick!

268
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,610
Rick! Rick!

269
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:50,940
Why?

270
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,030
Rick?

271
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,580
Mom saved me.

272
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,960
This is eye medicine.

273
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,050
Medicine?

274
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,580
Your mother's eyes 
must have been ill.

275
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:25,310
But she didn't want to worry you, 
so she pretended that she could still see.

276
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,980
Come to mention it,

277
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,980
she said she wasn't able to do enough for her children because of her body.

278
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,070
But on the inside, it must have been considerably harder for her.

279
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,380
She couldn't see.

280
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,030
Then...

281
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,950
Leo! Rick! Leo! Rick!

282
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,050
Mom couldn't see.

283
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,540
She was looking for us

284
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,500
and went into the children's room.

285
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,550
Mom...

286
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:15,560
What's the meaning of this?! 
I thought I was hired by the military!

287
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:19,070
So why was there a State Alchemist getting in our way?!

288
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,320
Hey, are you listening to me?!

289
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,320
Would you say something—

290
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,840
Where are you going now?

291
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:41,640
There are others who make their way 
while avoiding pursuit.

292
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,420
I think we shall go visit them.

293
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,930
Al, thanks for everything!

294
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:50,350
From now on, I'm going to go on living, holding memories of my mother dear.

295
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:51,660
Uh-huh.

296
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,430
I, too, am going to hold my memories.

297
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:58,660
Really... hold them as real memories.

298
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,360
Alphonse Elric...

299
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,060
Earlier,

300
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,860
I saw something in you.

301
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,280
The tears that you couldn't see in your own eyes.

302
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,830
You are human.

303
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,080
Scar-san...

304
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,080
Scar! Tell me one thing.

305
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,530
Did you, the people of Ishbala, have a Philosopher's Stone,

306
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,170
which the military was after?

307
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,940
No.

308
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,730
We sought a Philosopher's Stone,

309
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,180
to protect ourselves from being destroyed by the military that was after us.

310
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,680
So did you make one? 
A Philosopher's Stone?

311
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,190
Get us underway.

312
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,320
H-Hey! Hold on a minute!

313
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,860
Brother, let him go.

314
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,680
Those people need him.

315
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,500
Al, shall we get going?

316
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,460
Mm-hmm.

317
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:07,510
Now that I think about it, we always argued over the dumbest things, huh?

318
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,960
Mm-hmm, like who had top or bottom of the bunk beds, and stuff.

319
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,170
I lost that one.

320
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,750
And when we fought over toys, I won.

321
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,900
We fought over candy too, huh?

322
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,020
Ah, I never did win.

323
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,890
You squeeze your right hand, as if to reassure yourself

324
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,890

325
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,740

through the twisting winds

344
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,340
and continue to struggle,

345
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,340
or nothing will ever turn out!

356
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,520
We'll leave without telling anyone.
