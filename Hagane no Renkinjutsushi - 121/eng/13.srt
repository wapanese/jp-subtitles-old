East City · Eastern Command Center

3
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,470
We're here...

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,680
Yes, we are.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,830
What's the matter, Brother?

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,960
What do you think the matter is?

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,510
Once again, I'm going to have to hear the Colonel's long-winded, snide remarks.

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,430
"You struck out on the 
Philosopher's Stone at Liore, huh?"

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,070
"Just how much of the military's budget 
are you going to spend

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,210
on this fool's errand 
before you're satisfied?"

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,260
"Uh-oh, I don't see 
Edward-kun around."

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,630
"I'm right here!"

13
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:44,020
"Sorry, sorry, I didn't see you there 
behind my paperwork. Ha ha ha ha!"

14
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:51,200
But then, like you said, we're here now, 
so I guess I've got no choice.

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,230
Let's go, Al.

16
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,350
Huh? Al?

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,850
Al!

18
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,950
Sorry, sorry!

19
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,400
What are you up to?

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,960
What?

21
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,890
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

22
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,500
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

23
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:27,550
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

24
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,980
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

25
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:40,990
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:44,680

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:44,680
And leave me at the highest place there is,

Flame VS Fullmetal

86
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,600
What's the matter, Breda?

87
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,850
H-Havoc, watch out!

88
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,720
O-Over there! Over there!

89
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,610
What do we have here?

90
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,070
I believe it's a dog. A carnivorous canine. 
The scientific name is—

91
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,240
That's not what I was asking, Warrant Officer Falman.

92
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,840
I beg your pardon, Lt. Hawkeye.

93
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,300
I'm terribly sorry. 
I found him this morning.

94
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,870
Master Sgt. Fuery...

95
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,780
You're keeping him?

96
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,180
I wish I could, but as I'm sure you know, Lt. Havoc,

97
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,880
animals are not permitted in the dormitories.

98
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,970
You can't keep him here 
in the office because of that.

99
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:05,200
He was shivering out in the rain, and I felt so sorry for him.

100
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,970
Will anyone else keep him?

101
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,470
I'm also in the dorms.

102
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,230
No way. I hate dogs.

103
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,400
Okay, I guess I'll take him. I do like dogs, after all.

104
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,020
Thank you so much, Lieutenant!

105
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,120
I hear they're good 
when stir-fried.

106
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,180
Out here in the eastern country, 
they're raised for food.

107
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,250
The redder ones in particular—

108
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,140
Let's look for another master.

109
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,070
Right.

110
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,800
I'm kidding!

111
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,970
Um, are you busy?

112
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,050
Edward-kun, Alphonse-kun, 
you're back?

113
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:51,680
Was that...

114
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,440
Why, you... Al, come here!

115
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,650
Edward-kun, your report!

116
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,110
I'll go see the Colonel directly!

117
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,110
We don't have capacity 
or the conditions to keep him.

118
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,610
You can't just go around picking up animals.

119
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,630
But he was shivering out in the rain.

120
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,830
I can keep him, right?

121
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,620
No!

122
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,610
Go drop him off 
where you found him.

123
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,840
Brother, you idiot! 
You're not human!

124
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,420
Don't run! 
Think about the poor cat!

125
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,050
I know! I know!

126
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,310
It sounds like you really did 
quite a number on all of this.

127
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,320
You mean, the town of Liore?

128
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,040
You're the one who gave me the information on the fake Philosopher's Stone, right?

129
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,540
But I never told you to drive 
the Minister from his position.

130
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,190
As a result, the town has come under the rule of the Eastern Command Center, right?

131
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,390
Hey, don't tell me that's what 
you were after in the first place!

132
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,660
I heard that in Xenotime, the great landowner Mugear has gone missing

133
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,900
and that his mansion has collapsed.

134
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,560
Yeah? Where was this Xenotime again?

135
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,680
I wonder if I could get you to submit a report on the red water as well.

136
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,910
There was also an inquiry from the police in the tourist resort of Aquroya.

137
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,540
Is it true that Psiren's 
unmasked face is beautiful?

138
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,990
What you're trying to say is that 
you can tell everything we do, right?

139
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,640
Fullmetal, why don't you try settling down already?

140
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,440
Are you telling me to become one of your toadies?

141
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,100
We ourselves have a purpose.

142
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,350
The Philosopher's Stone, huh?

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,370
But it's been three years, 
and you still haven't found it.

144
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,110
I'll find it, no matter what!

145
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,120
Colonel, do you know 
the name Marcoh?

146
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,670
He's a doctor and an alchemist who showed up in Xenotime five years ago.

147
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,670
Apparently, he cured the poisoning caused by the red water,

148
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,090
something no one else could cure, with some kind of alchemy.

149
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,680
I figured that the military would at least know the name of someone that skilled.

150
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,810
I don't recall it.

151
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,930
But I will check it out.

152
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,320
Colonel...

153
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,790
This is an unexpected pleasure, Brigadier General.

154
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,170
As of today, we'll be using this office as a temporary Central Command Center.

155
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,550
A temporary Central Command Center?

156
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,740
What a hassle this must be!

157
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,720
There, at ease, at ease.

158
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,690
Führer, your Excellency!

159
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,730
Henceforth, His Excellency the Führer, 
and the chief command personnel under him,

160
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,980
will be observing the Eastern Region.

161
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,990
Look at all those chains!

162
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,700
Those are the silver watches that 
show that they're State Alchemists.

163
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,900
Which means that everyone here is a State Alchemist?

164
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,480
Look, look! 
Elicia can ride a tricycle now!

165
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,850
She follows me around everywhere like this!

166
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,720
You're the same as ever, Major.

167
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,710
I've got more. Wanna see?

168
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,320
Ah, no.

169
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,270
But you know, if you're going to come see us, you could've said something ahead of time.

170
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,000
But I wanted to see the surprised look on Mustang's face!

171
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,750
Oh, and I'm a Lt. Colonel now.

172
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,530
I'm in charge of investigations at the Court-Martial Office.

173
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:18,620
Then you should be in Central, shouldn't you?

174
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,510
What can I do?

175
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,610
All of the prominent bigwigs are 
trying to run away from Central—

176
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,620
I mean—never mind. 
Er, how have you been doing...

177
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,510
with the Philosopher's Stone?

178
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,940
We might be getting closer.

179
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,970
Right now, I'm searching for 
a man named Doctor Marcoh.

180
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,930
But the Colonel 
won't tell me anything.

181
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,760
Are you sure he 
just doesn't know?

182
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,270
Nah, that bastard is definitely hiding something.

183
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,270
You just said "Marcoh," didn't you?

184
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,800
Brigadier General Grand...

185
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,920
The Iron Blood Alchemist...

186
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,780
By "Marcoh,"

187
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,390
do you mean the deserter Marcoh?

188
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,990
Six years ago, many State Alchemists 
were called up to the Eastern Rebellion.

189
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,860
However, Marcoh deserted the battlefield before it came to an end

190
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,780
and has been missing ever since.

191
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,800
Deserter?

192
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,640
Don't know him.

193
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,140
Doctor Marcoh... 
Doctor Marcoh... Damn!

194
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,930
Sure enough, all records of him 
have been erased!

195
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:31,050
At this point, I guess I'll just have to 
flatten the Colonel and beat it out of him!

196
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,370
Flatten him, Brother?

197
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,150
Are you still...

198
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,740
Well, you know, it hasn't stopped raining yet...

199
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,740
Yo! I forgot to mention 
something important earlier.

200
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,830
What is it?!

201
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,540
W-Well... because of the situation,

202
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,830
this year's assessments will temporarily be held here rather than at Central.

203
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,990
Assessments?

204
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,430
You mean the assessments to renew certifications for State Alchemists?

205
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,420
I'll let you know later about the provisions and such—

206
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,510
Hang on, Major.

207
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,590
That's Lt. Colonel!

208
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,720
In that case, I have a way I'd like to try handling the assessment.

209
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,220
Right?

210
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,990
Battle assessment?

211
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,200
Is there such a thing?

212
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,160
The alchemist conducts a mock battle,

213
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,700
and the contest itself is what gets assessed.

214
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,720
And Edward himself 
requested to do this?

215
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,710
And what's more, he nominated the Colonel to go against?

216
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,210
Still, if they went at it seriously, 
which one do you think is stronger?

217
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,820
That'd be the Colonel, wouldn't it?

218
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,220
Nah, you can't take 
Fullmetal too lightly, either.

219
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,740
But when you think about the stories of the Colonel's activities during the Eastern Rebellion...

220
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,910
Why would Edward-san propose such a thing?

221
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,730
I heard that he gave the 
condition that if he won,

222
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,060
the Colonel would have to keep a cat.

223
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,670
A cat?

224
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:01,270
Well, I guess we can't have 
the Colonel take this guy, huh?

225
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:06,900
Yes?

226
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:10,830
A dog.

227
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,330
How nice!

228
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,180
Really?

229
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,210
Of course!

230
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,800
They are loyal above all else!

231
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,220
They follow their master's orders unconditionally!

232
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,750
Treat them cruelly, 
and they don't complain!

233
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,330
And they don't require a salary!

234
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,000
Indeed, they are servants to mankind!

235
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,760
How nice! I love dogs!

236
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,770
By the way, Colonel, are you 
going to accept Edward's challenge?

237
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,860
I can't very well go 
all-out against a child.

238
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,410
It will be a shame that I cannot display my true valor.

239
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,620
Sounds interesting.

240
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,050
I will permit this battle assessment.

241
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,840
B-But...

242
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,660
You can use the entire parade grounds.

243
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,130
That way, we won't have to worry about damage to the surrounding area.

244
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,630
It's not as though you 
weren't sure of yourself.

245
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,970
Go on, fight the Fullmetal Alchemist.

246
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,140
For now, I'm just going to 
dutifully obey their words.

247
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:17,940
At least until I achieve the rank of Führer and gain absolute power over the military.

248
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,130
I think you might want to be more discreet about such inappropriate declarations.

249
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,650
Still, what could your purpose be in saying something so presumptuous?

250
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,780
That's a stupid question.

251
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,230
Once I become Führer...

252
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,500
all female military personnel will wear miniskirts!

253
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,240
Colonel! I will follow you to the ends of the earth!

254
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,370
All right!

255
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,640
What pleasure!

256
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,760
Ladies and gentlemen!

257
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,100
Welcome to the Eastern 
Command Center Festival!

258
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,520
And incidentally, this is...

259
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,700
my daughter, 
who turned three this year!

260
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,950
Elicia! Elicia!

261
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,580
And now, we'll move directly to today's main event!

262
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,680
In the red corner, 
the Flame Alchemist,

263
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,430
Roy Mustang!

264
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,350
You ogre!

265
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,170
Only get yourself promoted, will you?

266
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,430
Return my girlfriend!

267
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,980
In the blue corner, 
the Fullmetal Alchemist,

268
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,810
Edward Elric!

269
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,160
Huh? Where? Where?

270
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,430
Wow, he's so small!

271
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,100
I can't see him!

272
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,100
Is he a grade-schooler?

273
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,320
Good luck, bean sprout!

274
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,910
Small?! Don't call me small!

275
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,910
Calm down, Brother.

276
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,880
Fine, then. Today is a great day,

277
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,910
when I bust the Colonel's 
pompous mug in front of everyone!

278
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,200
But, Brother, 
we're indebted to the Colonel.

279
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,950
He's overworked me, 
saying he'd let our secret out!

280
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,630
So, what's your strategy?

281
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,720
Pop him with my fist!

282
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,040
The assessment doesn't matter to me.

283
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,150
If I win, you're giving me your 
information on Doctor Marcoh.

284
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,100
That, and you're 
taking care of the cat.

285
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,600
Very well, then...

286
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,300
Ready...

287
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,280
Fight!

288
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,490
You're too slow!

289
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,690
Give me some warning, dammit!

290
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,660
"A soldier favors foolish haste above cleverness."

291
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,250
That means press the battle quickly, and end the battle quickly.

292
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,260
Those flames are 
appearing out of thin air!

293
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:55,260
Ah, this is the first time you've seen the Colonel do that?

294
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:59,270
His right glove is made of a special fabric, 
called ignition cloth.

295
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,050
If you rub it hard, it creates sparks.

296
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:05,280
All that's left is for him to adjust the density of oxygen in the air,

297
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,480
and "boom!"

298
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,160
Sorry!

299
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,290
Now, then...

300
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,540
It sure is hard to hit 
such a small target!

301
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,000
Don't call me small!

302
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,790
"If your opponent is of choleric temper, 
seek to irritate him."

303
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,380
Don't fall for the enemy's taunts.

304
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,140
You've gotta be kidding!

305
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,890
Perhaps I overdid it a bit.

306
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,230
There you are!

307
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,820
Oh, no!

308
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,700
Now you can't shoot 
any more flames!

309
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,700
You're done for!

310
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,220
Yow...

311
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:28,230
"All war is deception." Even sneak attacks make for worthy strategy, Fullmetal.

312
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,980
Do it!

313
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,250
You need not even ask.

314
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,870
That's far enough!

315
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,580
That was a magnificent fight!

316
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,320
We are honored by 
your words of praise!

317
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,590
Hold on! 
We're not through yet!

318
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,220
Mm-hmm, 
but if you go any further,

319
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,350
it will be tougher to 
tidy up afterward, won't it?

320
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:11,000
They've got no choice. Both of them were ordered to fix everything.

321
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,490
This is why I didn't want to do this.

322
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,410
Colonel, why did you hold back?

323
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,520
Your last shot—

324
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,830
you should've had the timing for it.

325
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,930
This goes back many years now,

326
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,400
but there was something 
called the Ishbalan Rebellion.

327
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,430
In the east, when the Ishbalans clashed with the military?

328
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:48,650
I saw... many unpleasant things...

329
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,470
Doctor Marcoh, 
who deserted the battlefield,

330
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:24,430
was the most sensible man among us. 
I still think so, even now.

331
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,470
Is that why you kept quiet about him?

332
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,670
But then, perhaps you ought to see Marcoh.

333
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,480
He's alive?!

334
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:44,950
Colonel, I still haven't heard the reason why you stopped on that last shot.

335
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,730
Nah,

336
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,950
never mind.

337
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,960
If there are no other 
candidates to keep him,

338
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,520
I will take him.

339
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,770
Really?!

340
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,970
Now, now, just because you're relieved...

341
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,400
My discipline is strict.

342
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,400
Come on now, the bathroom is over here. 
Got that, Black Hayate?

343
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,160
Black Hayate?

344
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:33,160
About the town of Liore, 
in Ed's report...

345
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,350
Did you know that General Hakuro's detachment had been dispatched there?

346
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,670
I hear there's a terrible 
civil war going on.

347
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,680
Ed wrote that the Minister had fallen,

348
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,460
and that the people would likely open their eyes.

349
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,090
The Minister is doing fine.

350
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,680
I understand he's inciting the citizens to wage war against the military.

351
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:56,690
I can't be sure whether or not it's the same minister that Ed defeated, though.

352
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,500
Are you going to send Ed in again to investigate?

353
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,900
He believes he's saved a town.

354
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,700
We can let him believe that.

355
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,190
He'll find out on his own sometime.

356
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,200
We've gotten the information on Marcoh from the Colonel.

357
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,710
We can't very well ask him to take care of this too.

358
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,860
It would go against the 
Principle of Equivalent Exchange.

359
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,090
Yes, it would.

360
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,800
Sorry, but right now, 
this is all we can do.

361
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,820
Isn't it about time you told me?

362
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,320
You're not here to observe us.

363
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,650
The bigwigs conned the Führer 
into fleeing here.

364
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:54,700
In Central alone, there are already five State Alchemists and staff

365
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,750
who have been killed.

366
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,750
East City...

367
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,700
With you always in my sight, I can manage to draw breath

368
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,700
itsumo no shisen ni kimi ga ite kokyuu ga dekiru

369
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:43,100
And for me, that ought to be enough in itself, and yet...

370
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:43,100
boku ni totte nara sore dake de mou juubun na hazu na no ni

371
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:51,000
All little old me ever does is repeat the same old mistakes

372
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:51,000
chippoke na boku wa kurikaesu ayamachi bakari

373
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,460
How much strength do I need to come by

374
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,460
dore hodo tsuyosa wo te ni shitara

375
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,430
before I can get by without hurting anything?

376
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,430
nanimo kizutsukezu ni sumu no?

377
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,960
I am not going to stray, I'm going to trust this love,

378
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,960
mayowazu ni kono ai wo,

379
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,770
and with it I will go on living!

380
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,770
shinjikite yuku

381
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,330
I'm going to take these wounds,

382
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,330
fusagaranu

383
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,020
the ones that will not close, and squeeze them tight!

384
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,020
kizuguchi mo gyutto dakishimete

385
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,280
The two of us must keep on walking,

386
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,280
futari wa arukitsuzukeru

387
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,160
The two of us must keep on walking,

388
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,160
futari wa arukitsuzukeru

389
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,250
since we can never return again

390
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,250
ato ni wa modorenai kara

391
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:29,300
Even now, deep within my heart,

392
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:29,300
ima demo kono mune no oku,

393
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:35,250
I still feel the pain of this indelible sin

394
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:35,250
kesenai tsumi wa itamu kedo

395
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:35,510
Darling

396
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,600
Darling

397
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,280
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

398
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,000
Destruction's Right Hand

399
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,950
Destruction's Right Hand

400
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,020
Destruction's Right Hand

401
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,020
Episode 14: "Destruction's Right Hand"

402
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:47,440
Even if all of the State Alchemists are your enemies,

403
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,610
I won't allow you to kill Brother!
