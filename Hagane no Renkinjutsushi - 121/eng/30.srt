1
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,000
How about it? 
Found anything good?

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,330
No, no such luck...

3
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,500
That won't do. You've got to fend for yourself here.

4
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,280
Thank you very much.

5
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,860
However, are you sure about this?

6
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,990
We are...

7
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,820
Looking at your skin and eyes, I can tell.

8
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,740
You're people from Ishbal, right?

9
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,440
This is a gathering place for 
those who, for whatever reason,

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,750
cannot live in the lands of their birth.

11
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,040
We've got petty criminals and corrupt soldiers

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,960
who have been found out and ousted here as well.

13
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,930
Laughable, isn't it? 
Here, have a drink.

14
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,220
A-An Ishbalan with a scar on his face!

15
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,480
I've heard about this guy before!

16
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,480
Wait! Hey, wait up!

17
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,980
Wait up, I say!

18
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,190
I'm sorry for popping off 
at you like that!

19
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,000
He merged himself with the wall?! Hey, you!

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Dammit!

21
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,000
Jeez, I'm in a hurry here.

22
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,010
Well?

23
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,200
They say that despite 
being a State Alchemist,

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,220
you have an interest in 
the Philosopher's Stone.

25
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,950
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

26
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,480
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

27
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:15,590
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

28
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:21,990
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

29
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,660
Far away, far away, our dreams will never fade

30
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,660
tooku tooku omoi hatenaku

31
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,960
If only the two of us could go back to

32
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,960
futari ga mujaki ni waratteta

33
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,810
the days when we laughed so innocently

34
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,810
ano koro ni modoreru nara

35
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,910
the days when we laughed so innocently

36
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,910
ano koro ni modoreru nara

37
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:52,740
Just like glassware

39
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:58,340
that has been smashed to pieces,

00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:58,340
glass-zaiku no you na

41
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:06,130
we're putting together the fragments of our memories

42
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:06,130
omoide no kakera o atsumeteru

43
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,920
It's the important things that you notice

45
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,740
It's the important things that you notice

47
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:17,490
once you've lost them

48
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:17,490

49
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:24,740
Oh, please, oh, please, stop time for me,

51
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:30,320
and engrave the way you look right now into my heart

53
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,870
And if, and if, I were ever allowed to,

55
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,280
I would be willing to sacrifice everything

57
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,930

60
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,000
Assault on South Headquarters

61
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,280
Ham, 100 grams, 128 cens.

62
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,560
I'd like to see someone named Izumi.

63
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,410
Chicken breasts, 160 cens.

64
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,390
The Elric brothers wouldn't have come visiting here, would they?

65
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:15,090
Do you know them? 
Please do something about them.

66
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,740
No way! I don't know what that person has in mind!

67
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,490
Besides, right now, 
Ed and Al are probably in trouble.

68
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,990
Sliced beef chuck, 200 cens.

69
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,750
We are here on military business.

70
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,500
There is no need to hide anything.

71
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,500
Mixed ground beef and pork, 98 cens.

72
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,960
Allow me...

73
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,350
Wait, Major! Ed... Huh?

74
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,790
It looks like a friendship has been born out of their muscles, huh?

75
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,290
What the?

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,370
So, where are the 
two of them, miss?

77
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,330
What are you talking about?

78
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:01,250
There are stories floating around about how you used your brother as an experimental subject

79
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,550
and transmuted only his spirit.

80
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,420
Or how you're being 
pursued by homunculi.

81
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,220
I'm offering to take you 
someplace safe!

82
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,160
Both you and your 
freak of a brother!

83
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,060
What did you say 
his brother was?

84
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:27,070
He really is hollow! 
Just like Tucker said!

85
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,170
Tucker-san?!

86
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,070
Why, you!

87
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,070
Don't get so upset 
over what people say!

88
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,830
You're not getting away!

89
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,920
Magnificent! However...

90
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,920
I'm magnificent as well.

91
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,780
What was that thing?

92
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,690
A Chimera?

93
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,140
Don't tell me he escaped from the 5th Laboratory.

94
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,650
Oh, Major! It's been a while.

95
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,180
Mm-hmm. This is Lt. Colonel Archer.

96
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,400
He is in charge of the 
Court-Martial Office.

97
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,400
Why are you out here 
in the countryside?

98
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,120
Court-Martial Office? 
Just like Lt. Colonel Hughes, right?

99
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,270
Is the Lt. Colonel doing all right?

100
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:22,630
I'd like to ask you about that Chimera, as well as several other things.

101
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,630
Sorry, but now is not the time.

102
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,140
Let's go.

103
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,140
Yeah.

104
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,020
This is starting to get interesting, is it not?

105
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,860
A perfect Chimera, huh?

106
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,640
I want him.

107
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,160
Huh?

108
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,410
"Huh?" doesn't cover it!

109
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:13,680
How come mine are different from yours, Ed and Al?

110
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,890
This isn't my real arm and leg.

111
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,400
Then what happened to your real ones, Ed?

112
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,190
Where are they?

113
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,000
Say, do you remember 
where you got this scar from?

114
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,370
I don't know where.

115
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,020
Maybe it is just a coincidence after all.

116
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,450
How could that be?

117
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,130
But, Brother, your arm and leg were 
carried away in an equivalent exchange, right?

118
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,790
Why would they be here?

119
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,640
It's just too weird.

120
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,090
Yeah, it's weird. That's for sure.

121
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,080
But you know, supposing that

122
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,150
my arm and leg were brought back from behind that doorway, then maybe...

123
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,660
your body, too, could be...

124
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,260
Take a close look at the sole of his right foot.

125
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,910
We're getting closer to the mystery of the 5th Laboratory.

126
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,450
Let's seize him.

127
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,670
Are we not taking the brothers?

128
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,620
We've got ourselves 
an even bigger catch. Do it.

129
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,180
Say, have I done anything wrong?

130
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,390
Brother!

131
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,270
What do you think 
you're doing, Major?!

132
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,900
Brother, no!

133
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,120
Major, that boy doesn't have any memory! We've already filed a report!

134
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,000
He's an important witness to the 
destructive activities that took place in Central.

135
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,600
We'll question him at the 
Southern Command Center.

136
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,210
What are you talking about?

137
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:19,680
You've seen this crest 
before too, haven't you?

138
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,260
That boy is in league 
with the homunculi?

139
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,650
He's connected to the persons who destroyed the 5th Laboratory.

140
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,480
Major!

141
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,450
Edward Elric, we're going to have to retake your testimonies as well.

142
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,120
Wait for us at 
your master's house.

143
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,130
Wasn't continuing this investigation prohibited by the Führer?

144
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,010
A long time ago,

145
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,300
I was bitten by a fox.

146
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,400
Right here.

147
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,010
That boy has the same scar 
on his shoulder.

148
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,730
What's more, that leg of his 
doesn't appear to be his own.

149
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,710
Are you saying that boy's arm and leg 
are yours? How could that be?

150
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,240
I don't know. 
That's why I want to verify it.

151
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,490
Give it up.

152
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,660
We can't! This is the reason why Brother and I have been struggling all this time!

153
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,230
And if you look into it—actually, 
I don't know how you would look into it—

154
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,920
but if you did find out that that is your brother's arm and leg, what would you do?

155
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,800
Pluck them off, 
and claim them for your own?

156
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,350
Don't be ridiculous!

157
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,330
In that case, you're better off 
not finding out.

158
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,460
Yoki... Yoki... I've heard that name before somewhere.

159
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,370
He said himself that he was once in charge of a mine in the east.

160
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,080
Ah, I remember now.

161
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,080
Yes, it's true! 
It's the honest truth!

162
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:19,090
Y-Yes, that's right!

163
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:24,930
That is wonderful. If it's true, then I will inform the Führer.

164
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,640
He would probably allow you to return to the military.

165
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,350
Yahoo!

166
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,850
So then, the place they took him to was, get this, the Southern Command Center!

167
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,820
That's great. Nice work.

168
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,360
Way to find him.

169
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,690
Forget about the brothers for a while,

170
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,110
and keep an eye on him. Got that?

171
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,570
It sounds like the Elric brothers are just like you said.

172
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:56,710
Y-Yes... I'm sure the two of them 
will be of use to you.

173
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,360
I hear that Envy and Pride and them are after them,

174
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,720
so it sounded like it would be fun 
to make off with them.

175
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,760
But thanks to them, it looks like we'll be able to come by something even better.

176
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:15,480
To think that there would be a homunculus with the ability to use alchemy, like me...

177
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,790
I'll have to get him on my side, or things will be more troublesome down the road.

178
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,480
Please let me go after him.

179
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,150
Dumbass. You think this is someplace that you can just get away with haphazardly busting into?

180
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,990
You guys are former soldiers, so you should understand.

181
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:33,500
I was once posted to the 
Southern Command Center.

182
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,330
Don't go butting in where you 
aren't needed, State Alchemist.

183
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:43,170
No, maybe we can have him at least show the other two the way.

184
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,590
However, if you try to betray us...

185
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:53,600
Please, suit yourself. 
I just want to see some fireworks again.

186
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,750
What did you do with that boy?!

187
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,380
We haven't done anything.

188
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,120
Sensei, why are you so particular about that boy, anyhow?

189
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,730
The military might be able to find out who he is.

190
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,950
Besides, that boy is...

191
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:20,830
Al!

192
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,460
...not human.

193
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,990
You may not believe it,

194
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:32,290
but we've met homunculi—created people.

195
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,560
They all had powers that 
normal humans could not possess.

196
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,150
Like a mouth that could eat any kind of metal,

197
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,240
fingers that could penetrate anything,

198
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,400
and the ability to 
transform their body at will.

199
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,290
That boy did use alchemy,

200
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,160
but he's still some kind of monster.

201
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,120
Do you know why 
a homunculus is born?

202
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,110
Izumi-san...

203
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:09,130
Did you think that I hadn't realized what that boy was?

204
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,760
Sensei!

205
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,760
Izumi-san!

206
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,800
She's been like this for that long?

207
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,160
Mm-hmm.

208
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,750
But she's so strong that 
it always slips our minds.

209
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,640
What kind of illness is it?

210
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,440
It's possible that the hospitals in Central might be able to cure—

211
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,130
Unfortunately, it would probably be too difficult for them.

212
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,870
Why is that?

213
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,260
I hate to say it, but rather than 
treating her in a rural hospital like this—

214
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,850
It's an incurable illness, isn't it?

215
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,770
Her organs from here 
to about here are gone.

216
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,490
Gone?

217
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,470
It's like they were completely cut out from her.

218
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:17,420
And the remaining organs are intricately linked to each other, maintaining their functions.

219
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,000
I don't even know how it is 
that she's holding on to her life.

220
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,500
Brother, that means...

221
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,710
It almost sounds like they were carried away, huh?

222
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,150
Then, Sensei did the 
same thing that we did.

223
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,370
Doctor!

224
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,110
Thanks, dear,

225
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,480
but I'm all right.

226
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,220
I'm going alone.

227
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,950
I wasn't able to do anything for you before, either.

228
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:56,840
Which is why...

229
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,650
Please... I don't want you to see...

230
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,350
what I'm about to do.

231
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,370
Sig-san!

232
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,440
Is Izumi-san inside there?

233
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,870
Why won't you tell me anything?

234
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:38,070
Neither will Izumi-san 
nor Ed nor Al...

235
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,870
Why?!

236
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,580
I didn't know anything.

237
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,250
She told me she was sorry.

238
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:57,340
I was the one who chose to keep her from giving birth, in order to save her life.

239
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:01,350
And yet she told me

240
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:04,020
she was sorry that 
she wasn't able to give birth,

241
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,440
over and over again.

242
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,390
Your baby?

243
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,850
Is that so?

244
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,910
But I didn't know...

245
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,300
her sorrow...

246
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,870
or how hard she was taking it.

247
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,120
I never thought she would do 
something like that on her own.

248
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,120
Something like what?

249
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,250
The same thing 
that Ed and Al did.

250
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,710
Human transmutation?

251
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,420
She tried to bring 
the baby back to life?

252
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,450
She did everything by herself.

253
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,430
I don't know 
what she saw there.

254
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,560
Just that when she came back,

255
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,940
the insides of her belly were completely gone,

256
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,610
and she said she would never 
be able to have children again.

257
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,450
And when she said that,

258
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,380
she told me 
she was sorry again.

259
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,850
It's up to you, mad bomber.

260
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,210
I might be a little 
short on sulfur here.

261
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,680
What was that explosion?

262
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,720
Major, seize that woman!

263
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,150
Major!

264
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,440
Well, well...

265
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,940
It's certainly festive here, huh?

266
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,410
Sensei...

267
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,210
Please put that boy down and get out of here.

268
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,210
Sensei, I am still 
a dog of the military!

269
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,600
Why would the Führer be here?

270
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,700
That lizard bastard!

271
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,090
Pardon me, but we have 
a slight interest in that boy too.

272
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,950
Among Sensei, the Major, 
not to mention these guys...

273
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,250
Damn. A four-way standoff, is it?

274
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,100
No, it's a five-way standoff.

275
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,860
That man just now...

276
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,330
Was he not of 
the people of Ishbal?

277
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,540
Do not approach him.

278
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,620
Did you not notice 
the tattoo on his face?

279
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,200
He is a transgressor.

280
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,440
He has disobeyed God's teachings 
and has been eternally cast out of Ishbal.

281
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:22,310
A group of Ishbalan people, in the south, in Kishua?

282
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,450
It is believed that 
Scar is among them.

283
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,180
You understand, don't you?

284
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,740
Yes, sir!

285
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,980
We're moving out!

286
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,620
Scar is in hiding in the western slums of the city of Kishua.

287
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,670
If he surrenders quietly, 
that will be fine.

288
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,050
If he resists, we will take him down, along with the slum's inhabitants.

289
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:14,380
On the day you left,

290
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:14,380
On the day you left,

291
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:14,380

292
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:14,380

293
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:21,670
I said good-bye and waved, like always

294
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:21,670
I said good-bye and waved, like always

295

296

297
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:27,890
Almost as if I would see you again

298
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:27,890
Almost as if I would see you again

299
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:27,890
