1
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,370
Nice of you to come.

2
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,760
I welcome you.

3
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,840
You don't look very welcoming.

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,990
I am he who was entrusted to guard this place.

5
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,850
For the time being, 
you may call me Number 48.

6
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,490
Number 48?

7
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,470
It's been so long. I'm delighted to be able to go against someone so capable.

8
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,850
You have run out of luck 
by coming up against me.

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,440
Do not think ill of me, kid.

10
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:52,940
And you, don't think ill of me for being the kid who defeated you.

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,690
Nice. You move well for your size. 
That's more like it.

12
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,670
Who are you?!

13
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,420
I should respond when 
asked who I am, huh?

14
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:14,420
My name is Number 66. 
Although, that's just what they call me at work.

15
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,440
Number 66?

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,230
Yes. I do have my own, proper name as well,

17
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,680
but if you heard it, you'd be 
so surprised you'd wet yourself.

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,190
I'll tell you when I finish you off.

19
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,320
<i>His reflexes...</i>

20
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,650
Why, you!

21
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,360
What?!

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,430
You brat!

23
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,090
<i>He's...</i>

24
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,840
<i>the same kind of armored body as Al?!</i>

25
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,810
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

26
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,410
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

27
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,450
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

28
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,980
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

29
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,140
Ready, steady, can't hold me back

30
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,490
Ready, steady, give me good luck

31
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,790
Ready, steady, never look back

32
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,190
Let's get started, ready, steady, go!

33
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,340

72
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,050
Soul of the Guardian

73
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,050
I knew it.

74
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,610
Just as I thought, you're hollow.

75
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,060
Surprising. You've done well to realize it.

76
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,810
I spar against someone like you all the time.

77
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,530
I could tell by 
the way you moved.

78
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,440
There's someone like me 
in the outside world, is there?

79
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,240
It bugs me to think

80
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,470
that there's some idiot besides me who 
thought of bonding a soul to a suit of armor.

81
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,170
Fascinating.

82
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,960
Allow me to reintroduce myself.

83
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,390
"Number 48" is the label I had as a condemned prisoner.

84
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:43,970
Officially, I'm supposed to have been executed two years ago.

85
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,460
A condemned prisoner?

86
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,550
<i>Which means that, sure enough, there's a connection</i>

87
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,310
<i>between the 5th Laboratory here and the prison next door.</i>

88
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,620
When I had a flesh-and-blood body, 
I was called "The Slicer."

89
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,520
I was a mass murderer, 
who caused many public disturbances.

90
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,220
Nowadays, my skills have been called upon, 
and I am the immortal watchdog over this place.

91
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,120
No, you're not immortal.

92
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,280
What?

93
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,280
Your bloodseal!

94
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,680
The iron within the blood is attuned with the metal of your armor,

95
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,530
and that is what keeps your soul 
bound to this world.

96
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,920
If that seal is broken, you'll die.

97
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,450
It appears that after all this time, 
I've encountered someone with a little backbone.

98
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,270
This should prove to be an interesting fight.

99
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,930
Your weak spot 
has been exposed.

100
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,910
If you're going to surrender, now's the time.

101
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,110
I don't care!

102
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,420
I'm the type who seeks a little tension in battle, you see.

103
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,870
Now then...

104
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,460
En garde!

105
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,710
<i>What was that? Just now there was something strange in my shoulder...</i>

106
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,590
<i>Since it's less heavy, 
its strength has dropped as well,</i>

107
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,450
<i>so make sure you don't do anything reckless.</i>

108
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,760
<i>I have to finish this quickly, or I'm in trouble!</i>

109
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,690
Just like a monkey, aren't you?

110
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,580
Hey, what'd you say?!

111
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,910
It's been ages since I've had 
such responsive prey. I'm delighted.

112
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,590
However, judging by your wound and your exhaustion,

113
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,410
the end of this battle is in sight.

114
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,240
As you can see, 
my body knows no fatigue.

115
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:28,010
Surrender. Right now, my companion is disposing of your partner outside.

116
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,410
You can't rely on him to help you.

117
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,430
Hey, this companion 
of yoursâ€”is he strong?

118
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,590
He's strong although not to 
the same extent as myself.

119
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,140
What's so funny?

120
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,150
In that case, 
I don't need to worry.

121
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,360
I've been sparring with him 
for a long time, but I've never won.

122
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,120
Why, you...

123
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,870
Hold still so I can chop you up!

124
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,710
You miserable behemoth!

125
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,220
I'm going to hurt you 
for all you're worth!

126
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,720
So you tell me...

127
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,140
Now!

128
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,770
I'm taking a shoulder roast!

129
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,330
Now you've gone and done it.

130
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,000
My head fell off.

131
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,250
Your body...

132
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,560
Yeah. Thanks to certain circumstances, I've wound up with this body.

133
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,970
You can't tell who I am, can you?

134
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,180
Don't tell me you've forgotten.

135
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,600
Thanks to you guys catching me, 
I was made a condemned criminal, after all.

136
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Number 66 was my label on death row.

137
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,730
When I still had a flesh-and-blood body, the name people called me by was...

138
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,950
the serial killer, Barry the Chopper!

139
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,950
Barry the Chopper?

140
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,790
Barry? You mean, from back then?!

141
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,290
That's right!

142
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,740
After being caught and executed,

143
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,130
I've come back from the depths of hell 
to take revenge against you!

144
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,010
You don't say.

145
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,520
Don't "you don't say" me!

146
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,680
People get surprised when 
an executed prisoner is still alive, you know!

147
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,880
And what's more, when a beheaded suit of armor still moves around,

148
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,310
you should be more like "Gyaah!"

149
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,580
or like "Waah!" or like "What's the deal with your body?!" or like...

150
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,320
Gyaah! What's the deal 
with your body?!

151
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,230
That's awful. You'll hurt my feelings, you know.

152
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,410
Are you a fellow 
executed prisoner too?

153
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,330
I'm no criminal!

154
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,930
Even so, now that I know, this fight is all mine.

155
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,830
I know what your weakness is!

156
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:12,590
If I destroy the bloodseal within 
that armor someplace, you will die.

157
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,230
Brace yourself!

158
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,380
The same goes for you too, right?

159
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:21,590
Yeah, but you don't know 
where my bloodseal is, do you?!

160
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,720
And you don't know 
where mine is, do you?

161
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,760
At this point,

162
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,350
I'll just have to slice you up and 
find out where your bloodseal is!

163
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,150
What's with him? Jeez...

164
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,860
B Block and C Block have both turned up nothing.

165
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,810
He must still be in the area somewhere! Find him, whatever it takes!

166
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:41,660
Yes, sir!

167
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,000
He's pretty bold to be staging an attack on a military facility like this.

168
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,150
Still, why is Scar so preoccupied with coming after Edward-san?

169
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,510
So then, where are 
the Elric brothers?

170
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,890
Uh, yeah, well, you see... 
It's like this...

171
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,160
You're acting suspiciously!

172
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,870
Major Armstrong!

173
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,060
With your authorization, 
could I have the forces here relocate?

174
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,900
What do you mean?

175
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,370
The Elric brothers are currently

176
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,910
at the Central 5th Laboratory.

177
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,030
Tell me more.

178
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,600
What's the matter? 
Your movements are growing poorer.

179
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,980
Are you through already, Pee-Wee?

180
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,740
Who are you calling too small to even see, who doesn't even make for a good target?!

181
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,750
At least your spirits are high.

182
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,740
But I wonder how much longer that will last!

183
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,960
<i>Not the Automail again!</i>

184
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,300
You're open!

185
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,780
You hold me in too low a regard.

186
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,950
Did you think you could best me 
from a spear's distance?

187
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,350
Ridiculous!

188
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,610
You've done well to have fought this long. However, you have reached your limits.

189
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:03,720
Resign yourself. 
There is no way you can win now.

190
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,220
We'll see about that.

191
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,730
You're forgetting that I'm not alone.

192
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,730
Now, Al!

193
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,730
When did you get in here?!

194
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,110
What?!

195
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,200
That's not fair!

196
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,710
All is fair in battle.

197
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:55,430
What's wrong? 
My bloodseal is not yet broken.

198
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,780
If your soul is in your head,

199
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,750
then once I cut it off, 
your body is just a hunk of iron.

200
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,900
There's no reason to 
fight you any longer.

201
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,030
Never mind that, there's something I wanted to ask you.

202
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,910
The Philosopher's Stone?

203
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,910
If you've come to investigate this place, there is little else you could be after.

204
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,820
In that case, 
we can cut to the chase.

205
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,460
Why don't you tell me 
everything you know about it?

206
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,620
I can't tell you.

207
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,960
What?!

208
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,420
Hey, beaten dogs 
don't get to show me up.

209
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,450
I'll break your bloodseal!

210
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,680
I haven't lost yet.

211
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,410
That's...

212
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,360
impossible!

213
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,080
One set of armor isn't necessarily limited to one soul, you know.

214
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,370
The body has a bloodseal as well?

215
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,500
Are you okay, 
my older brother?

216
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,460
Yeah, just barely, 
my younger brother.

217
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,970
Younger brother?

218
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,580
Did I forget to mention that?

219
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,480
The mass murderer known as the Slicer...

220
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,970
was a pair of mass-murdering brothers!

221
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,730
An independent head and body, huh?

222
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,190
That reeks of foul play!

223
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:28,190
Who was it that said 
"All is fair in battle"?

224
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,380
How dare you injure my brother!

225
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,130
You're going to pay for that, Pipsqueak!

226
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,450
Don't call me Pipsqueak!

227
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,380
Don't underestimaâ€”

228
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,080
Whoa, I'm not giving you any time to transmute!

229
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,340
<i>I'm losing too much blood.</i>

230
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,930
<i>I'm seriously starting to get lightheaded.</i>

231
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,880
<i>This is serious trouble.</i>

232
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,170
<i>Am I going to die here?</i>

233
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,660
<i>Dammit!</i>

234
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,330
<i>If I die here...</i>

235
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,150
<i>If I die here...</i>

236
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,130
who's going to return 
Al back to normal?!

237
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,880
How dare you 
do that to my brother!

238
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,800
I can do that too!

239
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,770
I won't give you 
enough time to transmute!

240
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,940
I just remembered that nasty fellow.

241
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,810
<i>What is this?!</i>

242
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,580
<i>He didn't perform transmutation,</i>

243
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,580
<i>just the decomposition technique?</i>

244
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,010
Sorry about that.

245
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,190
I can't die just yet.

246
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,440
Dammit! Now you've gone and done it, you dirty brat!

247
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,450
Ick!

248
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:26,480
Why, you! Dammit! 
I deserve better than this!

249
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,800
Damn. Brother...

250
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,110
As much as it pains me, 
we've lost, Brother.

251
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,190
Don't tell me that there's 
actually three of you brothers.

252
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,120
No, no.

253
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,120
No, no.

254
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,350
Well done, kid.

255
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,370
This time, you truly are victorious.

256
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,360
Well then, this time, 
tell me everything you know.

257
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,020
I cannot tell you.

258
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,120
Now, destroy us at once.

259
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,380
What?

260
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,050
Nothing remains for the defeated except death.

261
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,140
That is our rule.

262
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,890
I'm not about to kill anyone.

263
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,760
Hmph! You're far too generous!

264
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,770
With our bodies like this, 
can you possibly call us "someone"?

265
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,910
I didn't tell you to kill us.

266
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,290
I told you to <i>destroy</i> us.

267
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,150
Come on!

268
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,000
If I were to concede that you aren't people,

269
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,500
I'd... I'd have to concede 
that my younger brother,

270
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,410
Al, is not a person either.

271
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,530
Your younger brother?

272
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,530
Prosti menya, mladshiy brat!

273
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,530
Please forgive me, my junior brother,

274
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:54,610
Ya tak pred toboy vinovat

275
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:54,610
Iâ€™m so guilty towards you

276
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,530
Dammit!

277
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,410
Pyitatsya vernut' nyelzya

278
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,410
One shouldnâ€™t try to regain

279
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,140
Hasn't this gone on long enough, already?

280
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,530
I'm concerned about Brother.

281
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:04,030
togo, chto vzyala zyemlya

282
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:04,030
what was taken by the earth

283
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,000
Brother?

284
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,480
That pipsqueak alchemist 
is your brother?

285
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:09,750
Kto znayet zakon Byitiya,

286
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:09,750
The one who knows the law of Being

287
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,310
Brother gets angry 
if you mention his height.

288
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:12,210
Ah, I see...

289
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:15,050
pomog byi mne nayti otvet

290
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:15,050
would be able to help me to find the answer

291
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,550
What?

292
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,840
Zhestoko oshibsya ya

293
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,840
I was grossly mistaken

294
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:20,240
So it was your brother who 
gave you that armored form!

295
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,550
Ot smerti lekarstva nyet

296
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,550
Thereâ€™s no medicine against death

297
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,380
That's right. He risked 
his life to transmute me.

298
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,950
That's rich!

299
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,540
Milaya mama! Nyezhnaya!

300
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,540
Dear mother! Affectionate one!

301
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,310
What's so funny?!

302
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,560
Oh, how rude of me.

303
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:35,450
Myi tak lyubili tebya

304
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:35,450
We loved you so much

305
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,770
Brotherly love is so beautiful...

306
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:38,860
Even if it <i>is</i> false affection.

307
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:40,330
No vse nashi silyi

308
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:40,330
But all our efforts

309
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,110
False?

310
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,050
That's right! False love!

311
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:45,200
potrachenyi byili zrya

312
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:45,200
were spent in vain

313
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:47,700
That's not so! 
My brother genuinely loves me!

314
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,550
Tebya soblaznil ya

315
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,550
I lured you

316
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,070
What a perfectly naÃ¯ve fellow you are.

317
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,650
pryekrasnoy nadyezhdoy

318
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,650
with the beautiful hope

319
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,040
Suppose you were an imitation. What would you do then?

320
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,750
Suppose your personality and memories

321
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:00,570
vernut' nash semeynyiy ochag

322
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:00,570
to regain our familial hearth

323
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,050
were implanted in you as it suited 
your brother. What would you do then?

324
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:05,760
Moy brat, ya vo vsem vinovat

325
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:05,760
My brother, itâ€™s all my fault

326
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,980
Th-That just isn't so!

327
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,560
I am, without question, a person, whose name is Alphonse Elric!

328
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,460
As a spiritâ€”something indefinite, 
which cannot be seen with the eyeâ€”

329
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,140
how are you to prove that?

330
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:24,280
Your brotherâ€”and the people around youâ€”
could all be deceiving you.

331
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,560
That's...

332
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,930
That's not...

333
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,760
Nye plach', nye pechal'sya, starshiy brat!

334
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,760
Please donâ€™t cry, donâ€™t be sad, my older brother!

335
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,210
My brother is a person,

336
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:36,910
Nye tyi odin vinovat

337
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:36,910
Youâ€™re not the only one to blame

338
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,950
and you guys are people too.

339
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,110
I don't want...

340
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:41,800
Doroga u nas odna

341
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:41,800
Weâ€™re along the same road

342
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,780
to kill you.

343
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,530
Iskupim vinu do dna

344
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,530
Weâ€™ll fully expiate our guilt

345
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:45,930
Brother?

346
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:49,110
Amusing... Quite amusing...

347
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:52,320
Milaya mama! Nyezhnaya!

348
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:52,320
Dear mother! Affectionate one!

349
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,610
For as long as I can remember,

350
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,420
Myi tak lyubili tebya

351
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,420
We loved you so much

352
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,470
my brother and I have made our lives

353
00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:00,370
by stealing, breaking, killing, and being looked down upon as fiends and brutes.

354
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:02,230
No vse nashi silyi

355
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:02,230
But all our efforts

356
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,200
Now that we've abandoned our bodies, to say nothing of our hearts and minds,

357
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,060
potrachenyi byili zrya

358
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,060
were spent in vain

359
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,250
to think that, for the first time, 
we're being treated as people...

360
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:12,390
Ya sam soblaznilsya

361
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:12,390
I was lured myself

362
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,050
It's so amusing!

363
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:16,920
pryekprasnoy nadyezhdoy

364
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:16,920
with the beautiful hope

365
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,040
I'm a person!

366
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,170
I'm Alphonse Elric!

367
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:22,350
vernut' nash semeinyiy ochag

368
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:22,350
to regain our familial hearth

369
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:22,440
Do you have any proof that you ever really existed?

370
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,170
Where is your body?

371
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:27,570
Ya sam vo vsem vinovat

372
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:27,570
Itâ€™s all my own fault

373
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,500
Huh?!

374
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,760
Well, it's...

375
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,510
It can't be...

376
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,610
For all of it to be false...

377
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:35,190
That couldn't possibly be...

378
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,100
Listen, Al...

379
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,010
There's something... I've been meaning to say to you for a long time...

380
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,990
but I've been too scared... 
and I haven't been able to say it.

381
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,880
What is it?

382
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,210
What was Brother trying to tell me?

383
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,170
What was it that 
he was too scared to...

384
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,200
too scared to tell me?

385
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,630
Brother!

386
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:16,790
We are still crying out

387
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:16,790
bokura wa ima demo sakenderu

388
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,890
You squeeze your right hand, as if to reassure yourself

389
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,890
tashikameru you ni nigirishimeta migite

390
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,740
Go on, take those annoying rules and dash them away!

391
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,740
uzattai housoku o buchikowashite yuke

392
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:36,880
If it comes down to having to rest your wounded feet,

393
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:36,880
kizutsuita ashi o yasumaseru gurai nara

394
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,770
you've gotta keep moving forward, if only just a step!

395
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,770
tatta ippo demo koko kara susume

396
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:46,540
We've pushed our way

397
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:46,540
through the twisting winds

398
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:46,540
yuganda kaze o kaki wakete

399
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,670
and gotten beyond the cold sky

400
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,670
tsumetai sora o oikoshite

401
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:58,440
Yet we still continue to wander

402
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:58,440
soredemo mada samayoi tsuzuketeru

403
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,610
We always find ourselves crying out

404
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,610
bokura wa itsudemo sakenderu

405
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:11,950
Just continuing to believe is not the answer

406
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:11,950
shinji tsuzukeru dake ga kotae janai

407
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,660
We must bare our weaknesses and wounds,

408
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,660
yowasa mo kizu mo sarake dashite

409
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,340
and continue to struggle,

410
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,340
or nothing will ever turn out!

411
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,340
mogaki tsuzukenakereba hajimaranai

412
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:29,040
Break on through to the other side of the door!

413
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:29,040
tsukiyabure tobira no mukou e

414
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:34,640
To the other side of the door!

415
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:34,640
tobira no mukou e

416
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,070
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

417
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,000
The Red Glow

418
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,950
The Red Glow

419
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,020
The Red Glow

420
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,480
Episode 21: "The Red Glow"

421
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,720
If there's a color to people's lives...

422
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,140
that's probably the color it would be.
