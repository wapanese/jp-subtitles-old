00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,310
Edward-san!

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,610
Thank goodness! 
You're coming around, right?

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,550
Where am I?

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,910
Al!

5
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,790
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

6
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,380
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

7
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,430
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

8
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,510
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

Ready, steady, can't hold me back

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,520
Ready, steady, give me good luck

11
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,820
Ready, steady, never look back

12
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,220
Let's get started, ready, steady, go!

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,370

Sorry about that.

54
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,130
I'll get you back to normal right away, okay?

55
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,000
Mm-hmm.

56
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,300
Edward-san, what in the world 
happened at the 5th Laboratory?

57
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,490
Nothing much.

58
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,270
Nothing much? And you were this seriously injured?

59
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,210
It's no big deal.

60
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:53,520
Jeez, and I was just one step away from getting my hand on the truth, too.

61
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,270
Well, next time, I won't botch things—

62
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,270
Edward-san!

63
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,830
I apologize in advance 
for my discourtesy.

64
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,800
You nearly lost your life!

65
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,300
You should recognize that you are still a child!

66
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,810
You could trust us adults 
a little more, couldn't you?

67
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,620
My conduct was unbecoming of an inferior officer!

68
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,770
I beg your forgiveness!

69
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,480
I beg your forgiveness!

70
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,150
No, I'm the one 
who's sorry to you.

71
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,890
This is one of Ed's parts, all right.

72
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,640
As someone who's been sung of as 
a young, beautiful, gifted Automail engineer,

73
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,450
this is a terrible blunder for me!

74
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,010
Is something the matter?

75
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,760
Ah, no! N-Nothing at all, nothing at all, really!

76
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,850
Yes, Rockbell Prosthetic-Limb Outfitters.

77
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,100
Winry?

78
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,440
E-Ed?

79
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,190
As it turns out, I can't move my right arm anymore.

80
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:16,980
Sure enough...

81
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,360
Sure enough?

82
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,530
Ah, you see?

83
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,190
Didn't I tell you that I made it lighter, 
so it wouldn't be quite so strong this time?

84
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,240
Jeez, you've gone and done something reckless again, haven't you?

85
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,750
A-Anyhow, I can't get down there right now, so I'm in a fix.

86
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,430
In that case, I'll make the trip! 
I'll dash on over, just wait there.

87
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,750
Aren't you unusually kind today?

88
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,070
Oh, I'm always kind!

89
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,410
Okay then, if you would. Thanks.

90
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,400
This time, make sure you do his maintenance right.

91
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,360
Right...

92
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,740
Yo, Ed!

93
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,960
I heard you could get up.

94
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,520
Lieutenant Colonel!

95
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,580
Al, are you okay too?

96
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,540
Mm-hmm.

97
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,590
Oh, that's right.

98
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,670
Would you guys go buy some lunch for me?

99
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,250
Ah, I'll get that myself.

100
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,960
Lieutenant Ross, you go with him.

101
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,180
Understood.

102
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,460
Sorry, I'm just so hungry.

103
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,950
About the 5th Laboratory...

104
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,750
Everything that happened 
concerning the incident there

105
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:54,070
is being chalked up as the doing of Scar, 
who was pursuing you.

106
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,040
Of course, 
I'm not convinced of that.

107
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,650
There were a lot of bodies left there 
that are thought to have been Chimeras.

108
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:07,370
And a great deal of equipment that I can't help but believe was still operational until just yesterday.

109
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,080
Among the prisoners who were 
forcibly taken there by someone,

110
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,810
there are those who said they saw Brig. Gen. Basque Grand, who was killed in the line of duty.

111
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,030
What the hell happened there?

112
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,890
Ed!

113
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,400
How am I supposed to know?

114
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,470
Just tell me what you saw.

115
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,960
Homunculi.

116
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,710
Homunculi?!

117
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,760
You can't be serious!

118
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,210
Still...

119
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,760
they definitely weren't human.

120
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,260
They're tied in with the 
Philosopher's Stone, huh?

121
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,610
They were trying to make me create a Philosopher's Stone.

122
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,770
And by using live prisoners, at that.

123
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,340
What the hell...

124
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,660
Isn't that right, Al?

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,240
Mm-hmm.

126
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,000
A guardian who was only a spirit...

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,270
A dangerous guy named Envy or something...

128
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:29,510
Not to mention Philosopher's Stone transmutation circles and Uroboros tattoos...

129
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,480
I saw all of them there.

130
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,360
For experiments about a lousy stone, 
none of those are laughing matters, huh?

131
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,120
I heard from Marcoh-san

132
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,730
that Philosopher's Stones were used in the Eastern Rebellion.

133
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,690
They said that for some reason,

134
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,660
I was being kept alive 
for their sakes.

135
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,470
Thanks for telling me.

136
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,280
Let me handle it from here.

137
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,060
Get some rest.

138
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,830
Right now, you should just think about yourselves.

139
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,480
I'm finally here.

140
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,100
Let's see...

141
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,490
He said he was going to have a sign or something ready for me...

142
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,320
Well, well, if it isn't Winry!

143
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,570
Thank you for taking 
the trouble to come so far!

144
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,530
There it is.

145
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,410
No way... I hadn't heard 
that you were in a hospital!

146
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,080
Yeah, well, one thing led to another...

147
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,910
It's nothing to laugh about.

148
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,790
Winry?

149
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,930
I didn't maintain you properly,

150
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,500
and now, this has happened.

151
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,800
This isn't particularly your fault! 
Right, Al?

152
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,680
Mm-hmm.

153
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,670
There, you hear that?

154
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,390
But...

155
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,810
Your maintenance was perfect!

156
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,520
Besides, sometimes it just happens to stop moving.

157
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,540
If the timing had been different, 
what happened might've been worse.

158
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,270
And the reason it broke was because 
I was using it too roughly in the first place.

159
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,490
<i>Could it be that he hasn't noticed 
that I forgot to tighten that screw?</i>

160
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,430
Well, sure! 
Ed, you're always too rough!

161
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,910
Hey...

162
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:32,170
Excuse me. Lt. Colonel, 
there's a phone call from Colonel Mustang.

163
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,500
Yo! You called at a good time! 
I have great news!

164
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,930
You found Scar?!

165
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,960
Huh?! How would that be great news?!

166
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,310
Have you forgotten?

167
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,310
Tomorrow is Elicia-chan's birthday!

168
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,100
Unless you want to turn into charcoal, report your current situation immediately!

169
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,740
Not to worry. 
If anything happens, I'll contact you.

170
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,830
More importantly, be sure to send Elicia-chan a present.

171
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,920
Bye now!

172
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:06,380
Um, are you sure it's okay not to report anything?

173
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,330
It's okay.

174
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,420
Right now, he doesn't 
need to know anything.

175
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,930
Never mind that, how are 
those reports I requested?

176
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,680
Working without rest, 
I've finally finished them!

177
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,570
Okay, here's what's next.

178
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,310
How are you doing, Ed?

179
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,250
What do you know, 
you're done eating already.

180
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,460
Y-Yeah.

181
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,560
Well then, 
let me fix you right away...

182
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,230
You left your milk.

183
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,100
Ed...

184
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,870
Please, anything but that.

185
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,380
What are you talking about?! Milk is good for the body! Drink it right now!

186
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,600
Shut up! 
If I hate it, I hate it!

187
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,430
Not drinking my milk isn't 
particularly going to kill me!

188
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,460
Ah, jeez! This is the reason why you're always going to be such a bean sprout!

189
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,590
Bean sprout?

190
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,590
That's right, bean sprout.

191
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,220
Right, Al?

192
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,600
That's right, Brother. 
You have to drink it.

193
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,890
Yeah, yeah. Good for you, Al.

194
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,060
You got all big without 
having to drink this stuff.

195
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,480
I...

196
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,500
didn't get this body 
because I wanted to.

197
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,490
S-Sorry...

198
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,870
What's the matter between you two?

199
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,410
Al?

200
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,750
Did something happen?

201
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,030
Well?

202
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,170
Why?

203
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,540
How come you never talk to me?

204
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,970
About your injuries,

205
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,860
or about the two of you? 
Here I am, worried sick,

206
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,680
and you won't talk to me 
about anything important?!

207
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,310
Ed! Al!

208
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,280
I don't care anymore!

209
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,230
Yo! Nice to meet you, Winry-chan.

210
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,420
I'm Lt. Col. Maes Hughes. 
It's a pleasure.

211
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,620
And this...

212
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,560
is my adorable Elicia-chan!

213
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,180
How about it? Cute, right? 
You'd like to meet her, right?

214
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,320
Y-Yeah, sure...

215
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,840
All right! 
I'll let you meet her!

216
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,800
Okay then, I'll look after Winry-chan! Later!

217
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,190
U-Um...

218
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,290
You are so lucky!

219
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,520
After all, tomorrow is 
Elicia-chan's birthday.

220
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,690
Now that you mention it, so is Ed's...

221
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,970
Sure.

222
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,020
We'll have to get 
a present for him too.

223
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,440
So, what kind of present 
are you going to give Elicia-chan?

224
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,240
Huh?

225
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:45,180
What? A stuffed teddy bear? And a giant-size one, at that?

226
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,710
Elicia-chan will be thrilled with that!

227
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,710
Happy birthday, Elicia-chan!

228
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,410
Congratulations!

229
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,990
Way to go, Elicia-chan!

230
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,970
Congratulations!

231
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,610
You see, apples are best 
if you coat them with syrup.

232
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,720
So that's how you did it.

233
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,930
Lately, my own daughter has been...

234
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,330
Nice, Elicia-chan.

235
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,210
What a cute bear.

236
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,810
Elicia-chan...

237
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,750
Happy birthday.

238
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,520
Here's your present.

239
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,950
Thanks, Miss Bookworm.

240
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,530
Bookworm?

241
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,840
Miss?

242
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,370
Elicia-chan, can you tell me how old you are now?

243
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,720
Four!

244
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,660
How adorable!

245
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,750
Miss, know what?

246
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,380
Congratulations! 
Congratulations! Congratulations!

247
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,560
Know what? Papa says the more people say "congratulations" to you,

248
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,850
the more good things 
will happen to you.

249
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,230
That's why I'm telling you too, Miss.

250
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,700
Elicia-chan...

251
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,320
You two almost look 
like you're siblings.

252
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,800
Really. I wish I had 
a little sister like this.

253
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,830
I'm an only child, after all.

254
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,280
You do have brothers, you know.

255
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,460
Brothers would talk to me 
more about things.

256
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,710
For a long time now, they've never talked about anything important with me.

257
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,060
Can't help that.

258
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,130
Guys are creatures that demonstrate things more by their actions than with their words.

259
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:32,160
As much as possible, they don't want to burden anyone with their adversities.

260
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,770
Nor do they want to worry others. 
That's why they bottle everything up.

261
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,620
And even so, when those two 
finally do give in and complain,

262
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,580
I'll bet you're the 
only one they do it to.

263
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,560
When that happens, 
you're the one who receives them.

264
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,240
Isn't that enough?

265
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,070
If their older sister 
makes that kind of face,

266
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,500
the younger brothers won't ever 
come to depend on her, will they?

267
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,890
Hughes-san...

268
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,000
Here...

269
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:05,210
Thanks for waiting. I've finished 
baking a birthday cake for Ed-kun.

270
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,880
Go ahead, go, go!

271
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,380
Here.

272
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,490
But, Hughes-san, don't you have a present for Ed?

273
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,720
What are you talking about?

274
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,480
There's no present that's a match for your smiling face, Winry-chan.

275
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,990
Congratulations! 
Congratulations! Congratulations!

276
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,450
Know what? 
They say that on your birthday,

277
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:42,130
the more you get told "congratulations," the happier you'll be.

278
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,270
Here. This is from Gracia-san.

279
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,590
O-Oh...

280
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,450
I made sure to learn 
how to make it from her,

281
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,330
so once you're able to eat, 
I can make it for you at any time, Al.

282
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,480
Mm-hmm.

283
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,680
Now that you mention it, 
when we were kids,

284
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,750
the three of us always 
used to eat cake together, huh?

285
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,440
Uh-huh. And that one time, Den ate Al's cake.

286
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,680
And then Al bawled.

287
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,340
Right, right.

288
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,580
I-Is that so?

289
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,580
You were still little. 
Don't you remember?

290
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,080
Mm-mm.

291
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,160
Is something the matter?

292
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,440
I'll be outside until you 
finish repairing Brother.

293
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,250
Al...

294
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,820
Are you sure 
you're okay out here?

295
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,800
Yes.

296
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,520
Okay, I'll come back 
to get you later.

297
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,810
Thanks.

298
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,870
Say, Ed,

299
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,030
something happened 
between you and Al, huh?

300
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,030
I...

301
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,780
did something awful to him.

302
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:03,160
I had the chance to 
return him back to normal,

303
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,250
but I hesitated.

304
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,610
How come?

305
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:12,760
I would have had to 
sacrifice other people.

306
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,960
In comparison with Al,

307
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,830
they should have been people who I didn't care about...

308
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,060
But I couldn't do it...

309
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,410
while he watched from the sidelines...

310
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,590
It's good that you didn't.

311
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,770
After all, Al wouldn't be happy

312
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,530
if someone else 
ended up being sacrificed,

313
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,940
even if it did mean 
he could return to normal.

314
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,370
But still...

315
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:45,360
More importantly, 
I wonder if Al isn't upset

316
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,840
over seeing you about to sacrifice someone even once, Ed.

317
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,800
Suppose your personality and memories

318
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,960
were implanted in you 
as it suited your brother.

319
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,000
These people are all homunculi—
perfectly created humans.

320
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,320
Was I ever really human?

321
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,160
All finished.

322
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,660
Come on, let's go see Al.

323
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,030
But...

324
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,950
what do I say to him?

325
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,540
What are you talking about?

326
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,310
Just say "sorry" 
and apologize to him.

327
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,520
You're always stuck for words.

328
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,480
All right.

329
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,480
Al...

330
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,540
I'm sorry.

331
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,600
I'll fix you up right away.

332
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,610
Look, I brought a bunch of stuff from Resembool.

333
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,810
Al, I'm not giving up.

334
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,990
We'll do things our way

335
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,330
and get ourselves back to normal for sure, okay?

336
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,910
No matter what.

337
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:13,620
Maybe you can get back to normal like that, Brother,

338
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,920
but I wonder if the same goes for me.

339
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,180
Of course it does. Don't sweat it.

340
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,420
Here goes.

341
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:44,700
How's that?

342
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:52,040
That's the way you bonded my soul to this armor back then, huh?

343
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,500
Yeah.

344
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,170
Along with my memories...

345
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:01,040
Memories are nothing more than simply information, after all.

346
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,230
An alchemist as good as you, Brother,

347
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,060
would have no trouble concocting a person's memories, right?

348
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,800
Is that...

349
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,750
what you've been ruminating about?

350
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,810
Brother...

351
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:17,760
Earlier in Resembool, there was something you were about to tell me, remember?

352
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,780
Something you were too afraid to say to me till now.

353
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,910
It was that my soul and 
memories and everything

354
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,540
are really something fake that you came up with, wasn't it?

355
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,540
No! What Ed wanted 
to say to you was—

356
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,710
Never mind!

357
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:42,800
After all, the person named Alphonse Elric 
never existed in this world.

358
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,090
What are you saying?! 
You two have always been together!

359
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,660
Besides, there's been me 
and Grandma!

360
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,350
Believe me, Al!

361
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,480
What would you have me believe?

362
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,630
What would you have me believe, with this hollow body?

363
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,320
It's possible that all of you are deceiving me together, isn't it?

364
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,530
You've...

365
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,540
been keeping that 
to yourself all this time?

366
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,660
Is that all you have to say?

367
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,920
What about you, Brother?! Answer my question!

368
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,130
Why don't you say anything?! Why?!

369
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,740
Let go of me.

370
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,220
There's no point in me living!

371
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,510
You stupid jerk!

372
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,910
Let go of me! Let go of me!

373
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,000
Al!

374
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,060
Let go of me!

375
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,190
Ed!

376
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,030
Al...

377
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,120
Stay back.

378
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,710
Al...

379
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,160
Stay back...

380
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,750
Keep away!

381
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,000
Al!

382
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,370
Al!

383
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,320
Al!

384
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,250
Ed!

385
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:08,880
Al!

386
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,810
Al!

387
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,780
We are still crying out

388
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,780
bokura wa ima demo sakenderu

389
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,850
You squeeze your right hand, as if to reassure yourself

390
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,850
tashikameru you ni nigirishimeta migite

391
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,700
Go on, take those annoying rules and dash them away!

392
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,700
uzattai housoku o buchikowashite yuke

393
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,840
If it comes down to having to rest your wounded feet,

394
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,840
kizutsuita ashi o yasumaseru gurai nara

395
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,730
you've gotta keep moving forward, if only just a step!

396
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,730
tatta ippo demo koko kara susume

397
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,500
We've pushed our way

398
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,500
through the twisting winds

399
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,500
yuganda kaze o kaki wakete

400
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,630
and gotten beyond the cold sky

401
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,630
tsumetai sora o oikoshite

402
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,400
Yet we still continue to wander

403
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,400
soredemo mada samayoi tsuzuketeru

404
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,570
We always find ourselves crying out

405
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,570
bokura wa itsudemo sakenderu

406
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:11,910
Just continuing to believe is not the answer

407
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:11,910
shinji tsuzukeru dake ga kotae janai

408
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,620
We must bare our weaknesses and wounds,

409
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,620
yowasa mo kizu mo sarake dashite

410
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,300
and continue to struggle,

411
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,300
or nothing will ever turn out!

412
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,300
mogaki tsuzukenakereba hajimaranai

413
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:29,000
Break on through to the other side of the door!

414
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:29,000
tsukiyabure tobira no mukou e

415
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,600
To the other side of the door!

416
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,600
tobira no mukou e

417
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,200
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

418
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,000
Bonding Memories

419
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,950
Bonding Memories

420
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,020
Bonding Memories

421
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,020
Episode 24: "Bonding Memories"

422
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,820
Even if everybody else has forgotten,

423
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,480
I still remember...

424
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,780
your voice...

425
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,510
your warmth...

426
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,740
your smile...
