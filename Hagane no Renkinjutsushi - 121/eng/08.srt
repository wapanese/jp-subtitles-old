1
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:12,340
If ever there were a devilish act 
committed in this world,

2
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,740
this incident would 
definitely have to be it.

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,200
The devil, huh?

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,000
We State Alchemists are human weapons in the service of the military.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,300
Whenever something comes up, 
we are called upon,

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,650
and if ordered to, 
we must dirty our own hands.

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,910
From the point of doing this 
or that with other people's lives,

8
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,650
there's not a huge difference between the position we're in and the actions that Tucker took.

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,700
That is the reasoning of an adult.

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,470
But those children are still so...

11
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,630
Brother... Brother, the Lt. Colonel...

12
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,480
It's a wasted effort.

13
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,290
It is not possible to reconstruct 
a living creature once its life has been lost.

14
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,240
Not for any alchemist.

15
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,410
Who is it going to please to bring an abortive Chimera back to life?

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,050
There will be even greater suffering and anguish than this

17
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,920
waiting for you further down the road you have chosen.

18
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,110
As such, you must keep moving forward, 
even if you have to force yourselves to accept this.

19
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,860
Accept this, you say?!

20
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,090
There is some purpose you're trying to accomplish, right?

21
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,100
Do you have time 
to just stand still?

22
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,240
For crying out loud,

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,100
I won't even be able to get in 
a good bath with my daughter.

24
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,330
Here?

25
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,060
Yes, sir.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,200
From here on, this is a job for 
the Investigations Department.

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,110
Stand aside.

28
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,450
This is something awful.

29
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,100
Is this the work of that serial killer?

30
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,440
That guy specializes in young ladies, right?

31
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,610
What's more, this one 
hasn't been carved up.

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,460
It's almost as if...

33
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,470
they were blown up from the inside or something, from the look of it.

34
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,590
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

35
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,190
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

36
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:13,220
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

37
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:19,310
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

38
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:27,000
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

39
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:27,000
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

40
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:27,000
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

41
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:27,000
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,470
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,470
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,470
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,470

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,670
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

47
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,670
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

48
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,670
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

49
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,670
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

50
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,470
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

51
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,470
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

52
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,470
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

53
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:41,510
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

54
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:41,510
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

55
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,470
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

56
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,470
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

57
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,220
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

58
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,220
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,220

00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,940
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

62
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,940
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

63
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,340
Looking at the sky, 
thinking tomorrow must be coming,

64
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,340
asu ga kuru hazu no sora wo mite

65
00:02:54,530 --> 00:03:01,840
it's too much for my captivated heart to take

66
00:02:54,530 --> 00:03:01,840
mayou bakari no kokoro mote amashite iru

67
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,590
As a bird flutters along beside me,

68
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,590
katawara no tori ga habataita

69
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:12,690
I wonder where he managed to find his light

70
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:12,690
doko ka hikari wo mitsukerareta no ka na

71
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,590
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

72
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,590
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

73
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,130
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

74
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,130
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

75
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,130
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

76
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,130
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

77
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:23,300
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

78
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:23,300
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

79
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:30,690
And leave me at the highest place there is,

80
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:30,690
And leave me at the highest place there is,

81
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:30,690
soshite ichiban takai tokoro de

82
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:30,690
soshite ichiban takai tokoro de

83
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,580
far away from kindness?

84
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,580
okizari ni shite, yasashisa kara toozakete

85
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:45,950
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

86
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:45,950
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

92
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,510
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,510

96
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,490
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

97
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,050
The Philosopher's Stone

98
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,050
The Philosopher's Stone

99
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,040
That's a pretty serious look on your face.

100
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,820
For some reason, it feels like I'm at my wit's end.

101
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,320
And here I thought I was through wavering all over the place.

102
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,930
So then,

103
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,910
what are these orders?

104
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,410
This.

105
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,210
Sort out the materials here and organize them,

106
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,970
and make yourself completely familiar with the results of Tucker's research.

107
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,680
Are you telling me to 
take over Tucker's research?

108
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,930
He went about it the wrong way,

109
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,850
but there were portions of Tucker's research that have merit for the military.

110
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,350
Then you can let Tucker 
take care of it, can't you?

111
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,850
He's...

112
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,560
dead.

113
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,940
Apparently, his guilt was obvious,

114
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,200
so at the discretion of the higher-ups, he was executed.

115
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,570
You mean this was covered up! 
How could they?!

116
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,390
Pledge your loyalty to the military.

117
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,540
That's the main principle 
governing State Alchemists.

118
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,680
Say, it looks like Tucker-san was also doing research on the Philosopher's Stone.

119
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,450
Oh? That's nice.

120
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,930
How long are you going to sulk like this, Brother?

121
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,360
The Philosopher's Stone is the ultimate secret to us alchemists, you know.

122
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,340
It increases your faculty without bound

123
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,190
and makes transmutation 
beyond principles possible.

124
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,050
In other words, the things that 
we weren't able to do could be—

125
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,450
That thing is just a legend!

126
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,450
It's a fairy tale!

127
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,910
But if Tucker-san, a State Alchemist, was doing research on it, then...

128
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,830
Who gives a damn 
about his research?!

129
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,620
Al, have you forgotten about Nina?!

130
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,820
I cannot permit it.

131
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,260
Why not?

132
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,800
That serial killer might've done Nina in like that, right?

133
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,560
I'll help out in finding him!

134
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,010
And the work you were ordered to do?

135
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,270
What about analyzing Tucker's research?

136
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,620
I don't want to.

137
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,530
I'll investigate on my own, then.

138
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,780
Okay. In that case,

139
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,970
leave that here.

140
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,280
I intended to.

141
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,700
Brother!

142
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,640
Just a minute!

143
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,290
You're not the only one

144
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,990
who's upset over not being able to do anything for Nina, Brother!

145
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,010
We're alchemists, right?

146
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,260
Catching criminals isn't 
something that we can do.

147
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,030
We do research so that if another girl like Nina 
ever comes along who we can save...

148
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,030
You...

149
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,950
You... You're the guy from the library.

150
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,040
If you were able to come 
and go at the first branch,

151
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,370
does that mean you're 
a State Alchemist?

152
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,280
At the time, yeah. 
But not anymore.

153
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,250
Is that so?

154
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,260
You're better off.

155
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,680
<i>You're better off, that is...</i>

156
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,680
<i>assuming you don't want to be destroyed by this arm.</i>

157
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,360
Ed and Al sure will be surprised!

158
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,830
They'd never expect me, Winry-chan, 
to come all this way and congratulate them!

159
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,500
All righty!

160
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,200
Excuse me, Lt. Hawkeye?

161
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,540
That's all right.

162
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,710
But then, I don't know much about the Philosopher's Stone, either.

163
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,910
At least, I've never heard of it actually existing.

164
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,040
I thought it was just a legend.

165
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,600
I see...

166
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,720
However, I think you'd be better off 
not paying any interest in such a thing.

167
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,500
It's said that bad things happen to anyone that gets close to the Philosopher's Stone.

168
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,030
Oh, you're interested in the 
Philosopher's Stone, are you?

169
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,100
Who is this?

170
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,810
Th-This gentleman is...

171
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,450
You want to obtain the
Philosopher's Stone, do you?

172
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:36,780
Yes...

173
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,780
For what reason?

174
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,150
For human—

175
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,400
I mean, I want to recover 
something that my brother has lost.

176
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,250
Oh? You must think highly of your brother, huh?

177
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,510
I don't know any particulars myself,

178
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,510
but there are a lot of people who 
believe in the Philosopher's Stone.

179
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,670
What's more, once in a while, 
I hear stories about alchemists

180
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,420
who have succeeded in creating a Philosopher's Stone.

181
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,940
Such rumors naturally have a way of gathering around the military.

182
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:10,940
There should be a number of records about it 
in the first branch of the Central Library.

183
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,880
Really?

184
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,250
But then, only State Alchemists are allowed to make use of it.

185
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:23,400
So, a State Alchemist could verify 
whether the rumors are true or not.

186
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:34,080
Führer, why would you listen in 
on something like that?

187
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,900
It's good for the youth 
to pursue their dreams.

188
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,400
Don't you think so, Lieutenant?

189
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Sure...

190
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,850
See, I'm right! You think 
she's cute too, don't you?

191
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,980
Y-Yeah, I guess...

192
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,990
What do you think?

193
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,240
You think she takes after me?

194
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,200
What can I say? Everyone says so!

195
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,170
Don't bother me, Pops!

196
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,820
There's no need for that kind of talk.

197
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,170
Not when I've been showing you the classified analysis of the serial killer.

198
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,300
You owe me two. One for the train, and one for your wife's delivery.

199
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,360
Oh, yeah? Well, in any case, we're at a standstill.

200
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,370
The crimes happen within the city, but there are no witnesses.

201
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,280
The bodies are outright sliced up,

202
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,190
but nobody believes that he could do it all in such a short time.

203
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,130
Could he have killed them 
and then brought the bodies around?

204
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,760
How much time has passed from the time of death?

205
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,980
Not even the investigators 
are clear on that very often.

206
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,420
But between the military and police,

207
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,990
we've opened up and checked the trunk of every car...

208
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,710
coming into the city.

209
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,800
There must be some sort of blind spot.

210
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,710
A car that can hide the bodies, 
or something...

211
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,220
Or maybe it's the work of an alchemist...

212
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,220
Alchemists are not murderers!

213
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,930
Uh, are you Edward Elric-san?

214
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,280
Yes.

215
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,300
There's a visitor to see you at the Headquarters reception desk.

216
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,310
A visitor?

217
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,870
Howdy!

218
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,830
Thanks, as usual!

219
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,910
It's all right.

220
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,370
They held the state 
certification exams again, right?

221
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,410
Y-Yeah.

222
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,170
Oh, did you hear?

223
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,850
This time, there was a twelve-year-old who passed the test.

224
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,230
I hear he just does this with his hands,

225
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,220
and just like that, he can transmute.

226
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,000
Really?

227
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,430
There, the blond one.

228
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,930
And he's just a child, too.

229
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,280
Oh, come to think of it, 
watch out for that one guy.

230
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,090
They say he only 
cuts up the pretty ones.

231
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,940
Oh my, are you worried about me?

232
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,210
Sure.

233
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,220
I sure hope they catch him soon.

234
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,440
You bet.

235
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,450
So, about these incidents...

236
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,400
Have you heard anything else?

237
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,950
How long is Ed going to 
keep me waiting?

238
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,270
That's a refrigeration unit!

239
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:26,050
Central sure does have 
the latest cars. How nice!

240
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,430
I sure would like to dismantle it!

241
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,020
I'm afraid having it dismantled would put me out.

242
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,980
I'm sorry! Is this your truck?

243
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,370
That's right. This is my 
food shop's delivery truck.

244
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,030
Is something the matter?

245
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,960
If you'd like, would you 
care to look inside?

246
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,730
Huh? I can?! Thanks so much!

247
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,540
Huh?

248
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,650
I told her to wait right here.

249
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,150
That's strange...

250
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,380
Elric-san?

251
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,030
Is this...

252
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,580
Winry?

253
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,300
Huh?

254
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,150
Was there a car stopped here?

255
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,120
Yeah, there are always 
refrigerated trucks stopping here,

256
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,540
whose dealers serve 
the military's cafeteria.

257
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,710
Refrigerated truck?

258
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,850
Something that could hide a body?

259
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,210
It couldn't be...

260
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,130
Elric-san?!

261
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,500
Hey, are you all right?!

262
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,430
Were you kidnapped as well?

263
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,950
Over there, there's someone else.

264
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,620
There is? Okay, let's take them and get out of here, quick!

265
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,890
I'll be here with you, 
so don't worry—

266
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,310
Good morning, junior.

267
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,740
Why, you!

268
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,800
I heard that you can transmute 
without using transmutation circles,

269
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,440
so just to be safe...

270
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,280
Let me introduce myself.

271
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,950
I'm the shop's owner, Barry.

272
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,660
A man?

273
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,270
As a reward for making it this far, 
let me show you something you'll like.

274
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,340
Winry!

275
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,160
I'm about to craftily dissect this little girl.

276
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,960
Be sure to watch closely, now,

277
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,850
Mr. State Alchemist.

278
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,850
Stop! Why are you doing this?!

279
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,740
Why?

280
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,270
Well now, because I enjoy it, I suppose.

281
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,110
The first person I killed was my wife.

282
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,420
We were having some 
petty argument, you see.

283
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,650
Then, without meaning to, I killed her.

284
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,800
But then, she cut up so neatly, you know?

285
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,740
After that, I started wanting to 
cut people up even more neatly.

286
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,340
I wanted everyone to see.

287
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,870
How can one person kill another for something like that?!

288
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,840
Oh, but they can!

289
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,270
Given just the slightest opportunity, a person can kill another.

290
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:56,850
Stay back!

291
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:02,420
If they go off to war, it's even easier for one person to kill another.

292
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,000
Why do you suppose that is?

293
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,610
I-I don't know.

294
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,420
It's because people 
<i>want</i> to kill each other.

295
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,520
On the battlefield, I saw 
a State Alchemist just like you

296
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,350
kill other people with ease.

297
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,400
Splat! Just like that.

298
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,290
No...

299
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,880
No!

300
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,720
Why, you!

301
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,170
What?

302
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,450
Dammit!

303
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,010
Don't!

304
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,720
It'll take more than that to kill me.

305
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,480
They're in here!

306
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,950
Don't move!

307
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,650
Al...

308
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,990
Brother...

309
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,530
Does that hurt?

310
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,380
I thought I was going to get killed.

311
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,240
I really thought that I might die...

312
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,450
I was terrified...

313
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,460
Terribly scared...

314
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,720
Thanks to Hughes-san realizing

315
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,520
that trucks from this same food shop had passed inspections many times,

316
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,300
we somehow managed to get there in time.

317
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,440
Afterward, the case of 
Barry the Chopper became famous,

318
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,230
and it would be spoken of as Brother's first distinguished achievement.

319
00:18:58,850 --> 00:18:59,930
Brother...

320
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,150
The Philosopher's Stone 
might really exist.

321
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,460
But in order to search for it, you have to be certified as a State Alchemist.

322
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Since I don't have a body,

323
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,050
I can't really feel the terror you felt, 
thinking you were going to be killed, Brother.

324
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,650
I'm sure it must've been lonely...

325
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,360
and painful...

326
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,320
Sure, I want my old body back...

327
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,970
to be human again.

328
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,730
Once we find the 
Philosopher's Stone,

329
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,080
even if it means having to go against the flow of the rest of the world,

330
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,200
as though nothing will ever come of it...

331
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,370
Having nearly been killed, I realized something...

332
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,450
All I could do was scream.

333
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,900
My mind just went completely blank.

334
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:52,710
I couldn't even bring myself to think there would be anyone to save me.

335
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,500
For all that we're able to do,

336
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,210
we'll have our hands full just trying to get our own bodies back.

337
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,640
To that end,

338
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,490
whether it means being a dog of the military, or cursed as the devil, I don't care...

339
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,480
But then,

340
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,110
we really aren't devils, much less gods.

341
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,730
We're only human!

342
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,850
Tiny, insignificant humans, 
who couldn't even save Nina...

343
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,450
A condition, you say?

344
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,620
I will obey my duties to the military.

345
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,920
As such, I would like to be told all information there is about the Philosopher's Stone.

346
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,660
When I have no other duties, permit me to search for the Philosopher's Stone.

347
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,740
Are you sure you want it to get out that you committed the sin of human transmutation?

348
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,050
Your brother will be 
brought into the laboratory

349
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,470
as an extraordinary 
example of transmutation.

350
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,480
At least, that's the way I <i>could</i> 
pressure you to make sure you stay in line.

351
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,800
Okay, very well.

352
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:04,170
But you will report to me everything you find out about the Philosopher's Stone.

353
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,050
You have been given 
a title from the Führer.

354
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:12,200
It's quite an ironic title, though.

355
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,710
"We give the name 'Fullmetal' to thee,

356
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,750
Edward Elric, in the name of Führer King Bradley."

357
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,720
Fullmetal?

358
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,850
State Alchemists are given a silver watch, 
as well as a second name.

359
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,730
The second name that you will bear is "Fullmetal."

360
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,230
The Fullmetal Alchemist.

361
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:48,240
I like it. It has an oppressive feel to it. 
Sure, I'll take on that name!

362
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:54,000
To celebrate, you're going to treat me 
to all kinds of delicious things!

363
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,830
You've got it backwards, don't you?

364
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,370
I fixed your arm, didn't I?

365
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:08,200
Brother, I heard that the serial killer 
didn't have anything to do with Nina.

366
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,640
No, he seems to have an alibi for that night.

367
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,140
Then, I wonder who it was that wiped out Nina like that...

368
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:35,780
With you always in my sight, I can manage to draw breath

369
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:35,780
itsumo no shisen ni kimi ga ite kokyuu ga dekiru

370
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:43,180
And for me, that ought to be enough in itself, and yet...

371
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:43,180
boku ni totte nara sore dake de mou juubun na hazu na no ni

372
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:51,080
All little old me ever does is repeat the same old mistakes

373
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:51,080
chippoke na boku wa kurikaesu ayamachi bakari

374
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,540
How much strength do I need to come by

375
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,540
dore hodo tsuyosa wo te ni shitara

376
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,510
before I can get by without hurting anything?

377
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,510
nanimo kizutsukezu ni sumu no?

378
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,040
I am not going to stray, I'm going to trust this love,

379
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,040
mayowazu ni kono ai wo,

380
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,850
and with it I will go on living!

381
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,850
shinjikite yuku

382
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,410
I'm going to take these wounds,

383
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,410
fusagaranu

384
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:11,100
the ones that will not close, and squeeze them tight!

385
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:11,100
kizuguchi mo gyutto dakishimete

386
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,360
The two of us must keep on walking,

387
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,360
futari wa arukitsuzukeru

388
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,240
The two of us must keep on walking,

389
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,240
futari wa arukitsuzukeru

390
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,330
since we can never return again

391
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,330
ato ni wa modorenai kara

392
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:29,380
Even now, deep within my heart,

393
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:29,380
ima demo kono mune no oku,

394
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:35,330
I still feel the pain of this indelible sin

395
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:35,330
kesenai tsumi wa itamu kedo

396
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:35,590
Darling

397
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,680
Darling

398
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,520
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

399
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,040
The Dog of the Military's 
Silver Watch

400
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,990
The Dog of the Military's 
Silver Watch

401
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,060
The Dog of the Military's 
Silver Watch

402
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,290
Episode 9: "The Dog of the Military's 
Silver Watch"

403
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,280
I knew what it would mean to become a State Alchemist

404
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,850
from the very beginning,

405
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,270
Al...
