1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,980
Sure enough, there aren't any more books written about the Philosopher's Stone.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,880
Older Brother - 15

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,880
Older Brother - 15

4
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,880
Younger Brother - 14

5
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,880
Younger Brother - 14

6
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,700
What that minister had was a fake,

7
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,420
and once again, we don't have any other leads.

8
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,190
How about we head 
back to Central, then?

9
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,490
Brother!

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,490
Look!

11
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,500
"An Introduction to Alchemy." 
This sure takes me back.

12
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,500
Huh, it does?

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,510
Hey,

14
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,520
this is boring!

15
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,920
Older Brother - 6

16
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,920
Older Brother - 6

17
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,920
Younger Brother - 5

18
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,920
Younger Brother - 5

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,440
Hold on, just a little longer.

20
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,020
All right, done!

21
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,880
Watch this, Winry!

22
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,780
You said you were giving me a present.

23
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,280
And we're making your present right now.

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,550
That was our very first transmutation.

25
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,450
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

26
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,010
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,090
That is alchemy's
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

28
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:08,200
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

29
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:15,990
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

30
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:15,990
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

31
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:15,990
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

32
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:15,990
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

33
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:21,460
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

34
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:21,460
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

35
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:21,460
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

36
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:21,460
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

37
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:21,660
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

38
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:21,660
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

39
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:21,660
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

40
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:21,660
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

41
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,460
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

42
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,460
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

43
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,460
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

44
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:30,500
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

45
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:30,500
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

46
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,460
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

47
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,460
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

48
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,210
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

49
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,210
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

50
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,210
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

52
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,930
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

53
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,930
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

54
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,330
Looking at the sky, 
thinking tomorrow must be coming,

55
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,330
asu ga kuru hazu no sora wo mite

56
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:50,830
it's too much for my captivated heart to take

57
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:50,830
mayou bakari no kokoro mote amashite iru

58
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,580
As a bird flutters along beside me,

59
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,580
katawara no tori ga habataita

60
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:01,680
I wonder where he managed to find his light

61
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:01,680
doko ka hikari wo mitsukerareta no ka na

62
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,580
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

63
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,580
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

64
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,120
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

65
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,120
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

66
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,120
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

67
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,120
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

68
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,290
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

69
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,290
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

70
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:19,680
And leave me at the highest place there is,

71
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:19,680
And leave me at the highest place there is,

72
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:19,680
soshite ichiban takai tokoro de

73
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:19,680
soshite ichiban takai tokoro de

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,570
far away from kindness?

75
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,570
okizari ni shite, yasashisa kara toozakete

76
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:34,940
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

77
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:34,940
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

78
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:43,780
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

79
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:43,780
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

80
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,950
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,950
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

83
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,500
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

84
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,500
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,480
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

87
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,480
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

88
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,000
Mother...

89
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,000
Mother...

90
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,620
Winry, you were wrong to do that 
after those two went to all that trouble.

91
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,200
That's right. Both Edward-chan and Alphonse-chan were doing it for you.

92
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,850
I'm really sorry about this.

93
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,720
No matter how much they learn,

94
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,150
the usual person gives up 
somewhere along the way.

95
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,530
However, those boys are already magnificent alchemists.

96
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,780
But those boys shouldn't know anything about alchemy.

97
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,790
They are <i>his</i> sons after all.

98
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,300
So when did your dad 
teach you about alchemy?

99
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,520
How could we learn anything from someone who isn't ever around?

100
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,380
It was written in that book.

101
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,000
You can understand something as difficult as this?

102
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,310
More or less.

103
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,770
Did we do anything wrong?

104
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:58,270
No, you did outstanding! 
I think I'll brag to everyone about it.

105
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,030
Be sure to put the books back where you find them.

106
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,070
Once Dad comes home, 
make sure to thank him. And lastly,

107
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,830
do not open that door.

108
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,560
Understood!

109
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,610
Here they are!

110
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,720
Dad departed without telling anyone where he was going,

111
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,650
so Mom started staring off into the distance a lot.

112
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,800
But still, once we began practicing alchemy,

113
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,730
she would smile at us 
more frequently.

114
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,390
Mother was praising us.

115
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,730
We competed with each other 
as we became absorbed in alchemy.

116
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,610
Mom!

117
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,240
Mom!

118
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,140
Older Brother - 8

119
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,140
Older Brother - 8

120
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,140
Younger Brother - 7

121
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,140
Younger Brother - 7

122
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,450
Look, look!

123
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,240
See?

124
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,870
Oh, my!

125
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,040
Brother made it!

126
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,870
I can still only do this.

127
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,040
Incredible, both of you!

128
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,290
You certainly are his children!

129
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,800
Would Father commend us too?

130
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,120
Yes.

131
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,800
Once he comes home, 
I'm sure he will.

132
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,200
I'm going over to Winry's!

133
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,600
Brother!

134
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,110
Brother,

135
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,240
do you hate Father?

136
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,350
I wouldn't say I hate him...

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,830
I just don't remember him too well.

138
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,080
Whenever anyone talks about him, Mom makes a strange face.

139
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,660
That's what I don't like.

140
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,350
S-Sorry...

141
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,100
Let's go over to Winry's!

142
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,050
Wh-What do you mean?

143
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,610
Just like I told you!

144
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,310
My mom and dad are dead.

145
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:12,120
B-But your folks are doctors, right?

146
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,810
That's right. That's why they went to the war in Ishbal,

147
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,370
and now they're dead.

148
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,470
W-Winry,

149
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,600
our father is...

150
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,320
kind of in the same situation...

151
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,130
It's not the same!

152
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,630
If you're dead, that means 
you can never come back again!

153
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,140
It's <i>not</i> as though you can't ever come back.

154
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,170
I read so in a book.

155
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,280
There's this artificial person thing, 
called a homunculus.

156
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,650
It sounds sort of like a doll that doesn't have a mind.

157
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,810
But with alchemy, 
your folks could probably be—

158
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:47,650
Stop right there!

159
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,650
That is something 
which is not allowed!

160
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,130
Alchemy is not all-powerful.

161
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:57,450
That's why we Automail 
engineers exist, you know.

162
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,870
Dirty old hag...

163
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,200
I feel sorry for Winry.

164
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,030
What's the matter with you two?

165
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,700
What's the matter, Edward? You're such a big boy.

166
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,030
This looks funny, you know.

167
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,210
Al, you're so slow!

168
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,280
Older Brother - 10

169
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,280
Older Brother - 10

170
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,280
Younger Brother - 9

171
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,280
Younger Brother - 9

172
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,400
Mom, sorry we're late!

173
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,270
Mom...

174
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,350
Mom!

175
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,600
She hasn't been sick since just today or yesterday.

176
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,400
She must've been suffering 
from this illness for years now.

177
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,960
Honey...

178
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,930
These here are letters 
that came for him.

179
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,020
If we send a letter to 
each one of them...

180
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,300
Someone will know where he is and tell him to come home?

181
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,850
I don't want him to come home! 
But we don't have any choice! Damn!

182
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,650
Your dad...

183
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,380
left us this money.

184
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,230
I haven't touched it.

185
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,660
Use that,

186
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,910
and the two of you 
take care of each other.

187
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,900
What are you talking about, Mom?

188
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,850
Would you transmute something for me...

189
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,350
Edward?

190
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,770
I know...

191
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,920
A corsage would be nice.

192
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,750
He... always...

193
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,350
made them... for me.

194
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,440
The reason Mom was so thrilled to see us practicing alchemy

195
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,440
was that it reminded her of Dad.

196
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,650
That's what we finally realized.

197
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,050
Brother...

198
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,400
I'm hungry.

199
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,700
I'm cold as well.

200
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,170
Let's go home.

201
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,470
Al...

202
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,050
Let's...

203
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,470
bring Mom back.

204
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,150
Look, here in his notes!

205
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,480
I don't understand it all,

206
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,830
but something about human transmutation is written here!

207
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,070
If we can decipher this...

208
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:28,580
But it's written here that human transmutation is forbidden.

209
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,940
If dead people can come back to life, 
then of course it would make anyone happy.

210
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,160
Nobody has succeeded, 
and they're all frustrated,

211
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,700
so the grown-ups have just prohibited it.

212
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,020
Al, if you, me, and Mom can all live happily together again,

213
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,590
then Mom would be thrilled!

214
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,900
Still, maybe we should 
ask Dad about this first...

215
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,510
It's his fault that Mom died!

216
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,850
Mom was always waiting for him,

217
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,860
and he didn't even 
come home for her funeral!

218
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,650
If this is something that he 
couldn't do, then <i>we'll</i> do it!

219
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,860
<i>We're</i> gonna do it!

220
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,350
We found ourselves a teacher 
and learned alchemy from the beginning.

221
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,270
And then, one day...

222
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,880
Water, 35 liters;

223
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,880
carbon, 20 kilograms; ammonia, 4 liters;

224
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,100
lime, 1.5 kilograms...

225
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,880
Phosphorus, 800 grams;

226
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,890
salt, 250 grams; saltpeter, 100 grams;

227
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,390
fluorine, 7.5 grams;

228
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,390
iron, 5 grams; silicon, 3 grams...

229
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,850
These are the elements that comprise an adult human—

230
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,400
the structural formula.

231
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,420
By including a soul in this,

232
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:46,410
we should be able to call Mom's spirit back and connect it with her body once again.

233
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,750
Brother, are you sure we should?

234
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,820
After we've come this far, Al?

235
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,530
But still, alchemy is about 
equivalent exchange, right?

236
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,120
We've got the ingredients for the body,

237
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,360
but what do we exchange for Mom's spirit?

238
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,920
Don't worry, just stick out your finger.

239
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,430
Information...

240
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,300
about the soul...

241
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,700
That's everything.

242
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,940
Let's do it, Al.

243
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,450
The village of Resembool...

244
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,400
Brother, something's not right here!

245
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,700
Al!

246
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,660
Brother!

247
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,830
Brother!

248
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,540
Brother! Brother!

249
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,920
Al!

250
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,420
The last thing I saw

251
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,100
was the sight of Brother's left leg 
being broken down and disappearing.

252
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,430
And then...

253
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,940
What is this?

254
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,040
I'm sorry, Al.

255
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,650
Brother!

256
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,100
Brother, what happened to me? And...

257
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,400
your arm...

258
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,340
With just my right arm,

259
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:14,650
I was only able to bond your spirit to the armor that was sitting over there.

260
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,890
Brother...

261
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,050
So, what about Mom?

262
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:21,900
It wasn't...

263
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,400
human.

264
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,200
That can't be...

265
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,770
How come? Brother, your theories should have been perfect.

266
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:37,350
My theories weren't what was wrong.

267
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,120
What was wrong...

268
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,830
was us.

269
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,580
Grandma!

270
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,590
Brother...

271
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,590
Help my brother!

272
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,590
Al...

273
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,130
is that you?

274
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,100
You guys are back from your training?

275
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,780
So then, why?

276
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:07,860
Don't tell me you were thinking of creating your mom.

277
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,860
So that's it. That was the light 
of human transmutation, huh?

278
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,870
I've never seen such a furious reaction in a transmutation before.

279
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,550
Pardon me.

280
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,930
A State Alchemist?

281
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,030
What business does 
the military have here?

282
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:28,370
As you can see, these boys 
have suffered grave injuries.

283
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,300
This letter came my way.

284
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,130
That's one that Brother sent to Dad's acquaintances!

285
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:39,610
We've been searching for your father, Hohenheim, for a long time.

286
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,530
We still don't know 
where their father is.

287
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,650
There are hurt people here. Go away.

288
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,240
If they performed human transmutation

289
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,320
and escaped with their lives,

290
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,970
then I am more interested in them 
than in their father.

291
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,750
They could make fine State Alchemists.

292
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,830
This boy hasn't done anything.

293
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,050
Go away, we have things to do here.

294
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,960
I am State Alchemist 
Lt. Col. Roy Mustang.

295
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,500
Come pay a visit to Central.

296
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,720
Uh, good morning, Winry.

297
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,830
Al! You're awake?! 
I-I'm sorry, I was just...

298
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,840
Grandma, in the house, there's some money...

299
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,660
You dummy, don't be worried over something as trivial as that.

300
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,300
That's not what I meant.

301
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,810
Use that money and fix me up 
with some Automail.

302
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,210
I'm going to go see that Roy guy from earlier

303
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,470
and become a State Alchemist.

304
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,520
I'll need the freedom of my own arms and legs to do so, right?

305
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,320
You mean, you were listening?

306
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:17,320
I heard about them from my teacher. If I become a State Alchemist,

307
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,260
I'll be able to read valuable documents that the state is in charge of.

308
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,400
I'll also be provided an allowance 
and allowed to do research on my own.

309
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,960
What's more, that watch 
can amplify an alchemist's power.

310
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,460
Didn't your teacher tell you this?

311
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:36,160
Once war breaks out, 
you will be brought into it,

312
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,380
and if ordered, use your alchemy to 
take lives for the good of the people.

313
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,780
In the war that claimed 
my own sons' lives,

314
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,480
there were State Alchemists involved.

315
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,030
I don't care if I have to become 
a dog of the military or whatever.

316
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,570
There is something that I have to do.

317
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,750
Ed, are you still at it?

318
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,280
Just bear with us. This is the highest-quality stuff I can make!

319
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,040
We're okay! Don't come in!

320
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,650
I'm surprised.

321
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:16,210
Even adults scream at the pain of attaching each nerve to the mechanisms.

322
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,220
This pain is nothing...

323
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,660
compared to his.

324
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,360
It's been a while. 
Shall we go at it,

325
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,340
Brother?

326
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,860
"To train the mind, 
one must train the body."

327
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,450
That's what Teacher said.

328
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,380
But, Al, are you going to be able to handle it in that body?

329
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,870
I'm not going to lose 
to some Automail!

330
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,380
Brother, are you serious about becoming a State Alchemist?

331
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:15,820
I don't know whether or not I can become one, 
but I am going to go see that Roy guy.

332
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,180
Don't do it.

333
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,650
I've made up my mind.

334
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,860
Well then, I'll become one!

335
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,270
You can't.

336
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:26,320
Brother, are you still 
planning to transmute Mom?

337
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:32,270
You said at the time that we were wrong to do so, didn't you?

338
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,920
I'll become a State Alchemist,

339
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:44,930
and then I'll find a way to 
get your arm and leg back.

340
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,800
You don't have to worry about that.

341
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,960
But it's my fault!

342
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,940
If I had objected, 
you wouldn't have lost your leg!

343
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,100
And then you lost your arm in order to bond my spirit...

344
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,670
What about you? What are you supposed to do with that body?

345
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,010
Brother...

346
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:12,620
I'm going to go find a way 
to get you back to normal.

347
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,420
You won't try anything with Mom, right?

348
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:20,480
Mnye nye v chem tebya upreknut'

349
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:20,480
I have nothing to reproach you with,

350
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:21,280
It's likely that there isn't anything in the world

351
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:25,640
I ya nye obihen nichut'

352
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:25,640
and I bear no grudge at all

353
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,480
that we can exchange 
equivalently for Mom's life.

354
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,170
And besides...

355
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,550
I don't want to lose you too.

356
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:30,410
Tyazhek, nash gryekh

357
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:30,410
Grievous is our sin

358
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,450
In that case, 
I'm going with you.

359
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:35,010
khotet' byit' silneye vsekh

360
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:35,010
to desire to be stronger than anybody

361
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,500
But why?

362
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,700
Brother, you slack off too quickly! If I'm not around...

363
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:41,160
Milaya mama! Nyezhnaya!

364
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:41,160
Dear mother! Affectionate one!

365
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,640
That's what you're getting at?

366
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,190
And I...

367
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,890
don't ever want us 
to get separated again.

368
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:46,220
Myi tak lyubili tebya

369
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:46,220
We loved you so much

370
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:51,020
No vse nashi silyi

371
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:51,020
But all our efforts

372
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:56,050
potrachenyi byili zrya

373
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:56,050
were spent in vain

374
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:00,740
Ya sam soblaznilsya

375
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:00,740
I was lured myself

376
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,960
Even though they 
were our own bodies,

377
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,100
pryekprasnoy nadyezhdoy

378
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,100
with the beautiful hope

379
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,700
we would still be seeking to perform a forbidden human transmutation.

380
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,970
vernut' nash semeinyiy ochag

381
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,970
to regain our familial hearth

382
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,970
If unsuccessful,

383
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,970
this time we would probably 
disappear from this world for good.

384
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:16,290
Ya sam vo vsem vinovat

385
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:16,290
It’s all my own fault

386
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,550
There would be no telling what further punishment we would receive.

387
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,980
There could be no 
turning back for us.

388
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,900
And so, on the day 
we left on our journey,

389
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,380
Older Brother - 11

390
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,380
Older Brother - 11

391
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,380
Younger Brother - 10

392
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,380
Younger Brother - 10

393
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,480
we burned down our house.

394
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,700
With you always in my sight, I can manage to draw breath

395
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,700
itsumo no shisen ni kimi ga ite kokyuu ga dekiru

396
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:43,100
And for me, that ought to be enough in itself, and yet...

397
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:43,100
boku ni totte nara sore dake de mou juubun na hazu na no ni

398
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:51,000
All little old me ever does is repeat the same old mistakes

399
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:51,000
chippoke na boku wa kurikaesu ayamachi bakari

400
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,460
How much strength do I need to come by

401
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,460
dore hodo tsuyosa wo te ni shitara

402
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,430
before I can get by without hurting anything?

403
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,430
nanimo kizutsukezu ni sumu no?

404
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,960
I am not going to stray, I'm going to trust this love,

405
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,960
mayowazu ni kono ai wo,

406
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,770
and with it I will go on living!

407
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,770
shinjikite yuku

408
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,330
I'm going to take these wounds,

409
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,330
fusagaranu

410
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,020
the ones that will not close, and squeeze them tight!

411
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,020
kizuguchi mo gyutto dakishimete

412
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,280
The two of us must keep on walking,

413
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,280
futari wa arukitsuzukeru

414
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,160
The two of us must keep on walking,

415
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,160
futari wa arukitsuzukeru

416
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,250
since we can never return again

417
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,250
ato ni wa modorenai kara

418
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:29,300
Even now, deep within my heart,

419
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:29,300
ima demo kono mune no oku,

420
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:35,250
I still feel the pain of this indelible sin

421
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:35,250
kesenai tsumi wa itamu kedo

422
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:35,510
Darling

423
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,600
Darling

424
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,570
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

425
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,960
Transmutation of Love

426
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,910
Transmutation of Love

427
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,980
Transmutation of Love

428
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,980
Episode 4: "Transmutation of Love"

429
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:47,280
When a doll takes on life, a man learns of his own foolishness.

430
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,600
And yet he'll do it again 
if he can transmute love.
