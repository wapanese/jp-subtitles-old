1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,320
So then, have you made up 
your mind to take the exam?

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,940
Of course! I can even wag my tail too if you'd like.

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:14,950
Very well.

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,460
From now on, you two will apply yourself to 
your studies wherever you feel is most suitable.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,410
"The Sewing Life Alchemist"?

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,650
Shou Tucker—

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,710
the foremost authority on transmuting living bodies.

8
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:35,390
And so, we came to spend the remaining time before our exam at the Tucker house.

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,750
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,850
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

11
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,370
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

12
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,480
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:04,040
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:04,040
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:04,040
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:04,040
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,510
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,510
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,510
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,510
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

21
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,710
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

22
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,710
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

23
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,710
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

24
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,710
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

25
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,510
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

26
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,510
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

27
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,510
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

28
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,550
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

29
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,550
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

30
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,510
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

31
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,510
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,260
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

33
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,260
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,980
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

38
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,380
Looking at the sky, 
thinking tomorrow must be coming,

39
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,380
asu ga kuru hazu no sora wo mite

40
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:38,880
it's too much for my captivated heart to take

41
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:38,880
mayou bakari no kokoro mote amashite iru

42
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,630
As a bird flutters along beside me,

43
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,630
katawara no tori ga habataita

44
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:49,730
I wonder where he managed to find his light

45
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:49,730
doko ka hikari wo mitsukerareta no ka na

46
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,630
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

47
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,630
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

48
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,170
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

49
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,170
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

50
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,170
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

51
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,170
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

52
00:01:54,170 --> 00:02:00,340
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

53
00:01:54,170 --> 00:02:00,340
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

54
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:07,730
And leave me at the highest place there is,

55
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:07,730
And leave me at the highest place there is,

56
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:07,730
soshite ichiban takai tokoro de

57
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:07,730
soshite ichiban takai tokoro de

58
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:11,620
far away from kindness?

59
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:11,620
okizari ni shite, yasashisa kara toozakete

60
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:22,990
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:22,990
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

72
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,970
State Alchemist Qualification Exam

73
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,970
State Alchemist Qualification Exam

74
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,710
Two years ago,

75
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,480
Mr. Tucker successfully transmuted 
a Chimera that could speak man's language.

76
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,840
He has taken the State Alchemist Certification Examination as well.

77
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,190
A Chimera that speaks man's language?!

78
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,940
It was a composite beast that was created at the cost of multiple creatures that had differing genetics.

79
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,320
Or, to put it another way, a Chimera that could understand what a person says and could speak.

80
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,160
Awesome!

81
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,440
Mr. Tucker also lives with his daughter, who is about to turn four.

82
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,420
Then he doesn't have a wife?

83
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,800
Here we are.

84
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,260
Wow, it's huge!

85
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,130
Incredible, huh, Brother?

86
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,350
What are you doing? 
Come over here, quickly!

87
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,850
Oh, right...

88
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,900
B-Brother?

89
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,100
You can't do that, you know, Alexander!

90
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,160
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

91
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,700
You're Tucker-san?

92
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,100
Yeah, I'm terribly sorry about all this.

93
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,920
We don't have any woman's touch around here.

94
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,670
It's like this inside the house too.

95
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,940
Wow. Bigger Brother's clothes are funny.

96
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,220
Aren't they heavy?

97
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,800
It's all right. 
Big Brother is very strong.

98
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,730
I'm sure you'll have a chance to 
discuss their natures at some point.

99
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,950
Until you do, just accept them.

100
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,490
Okay, Nina, go play outside.

101
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,790
Alexander must be lonesome.

102
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,830
Okay then, I'll see you later.

103
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,220
Who would have thought you'd aspire to be State Alchemists at your ages?

104
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,380
If there's anything I can do for you, 
just let me know, okay?

105
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,000
Well, Tucker-san, I'd like to have you 
show us the Chimera you transmuted.

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,640
Me too.

107
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,350
Oh, it died not long after 
it was transmuted, you see...

108
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,580
Anyways, passing marks come first.

109
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,660
It will take more than just an 
overnight effort to pass this test.

110
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,160
This is the materials room. You're free to use it.

111
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,170
This is incredible, Brother. 
It's full of books I've never even seen!

112
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,350
The materials in here are just a fraction

113
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,800
compared to what they have 
at the National Central Library.

114
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,800
If you pass the test, you can get 
materials that will give you dozens—

115
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,130
no, hundreds of times 
more knowledge than this.

116
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,810
Is that right?

117
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,250
Brother, we should get busy—

118
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,100
Oh, Brother...

119
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,820
Ed-kun, are you making any progress with your studies?

120
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,740
Yeah, some.

121
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,330
But there's so much stuff here that I didn't know.

122
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:56,200
The test is hard even for adults who have received special education.

123
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,680
But you're still so young.

124
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,820
You don't need to force yourself to 
worry about it this year.

125
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,750
No...

126
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,580
I'll try to do everything that I can,

127
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,840
no matter how slim the 
possibilities are of me passing.

128
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,650
If I can keep moving ahead...

129
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,890
Bigger Brother, 
you haven't eaten anything!

130
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,140
That won't do! You have to make sure to eat!

131
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,470
Huh? Um...

132
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,650
Thanks.

133
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,950
This sure does look delicious.

134
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,650
Be sure you chew it well!

135
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,420
Mm-hmm.

136
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,160
This sure is good!

137
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,410
Here! Have another one!

138
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,420
Can't sleep?

139
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,420
Yeah. My head is too full of all the things I learned.

140
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,670
Oh, yeah?

141
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,830
Say, Brother...

142
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,160
I'm sure you'll be able 
to pass the test.

143
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,750
So you should at least get a good night's rest.

144
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,300
It sure takes me back, the way this all feels.

145
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,730
The two of us wanted nothing 
but to become State Alchemists.

146
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,700
Once we did, we felt that some kind of path would become open to us.

147
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,250
Oh no, is it this late already?

148
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,000
Al, where are you?

149
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,700
Is he off playing?

150
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,350
Al!

151
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,840
Brother!

152
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,550
Little Big Brother, it snowed!

153
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,950
Big Brothers,

154
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:59,450
I wish you could stay here all the time 
after you pass your test.

155
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,300
Big Brother, what are you drawing?

156
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,700
It's called a transmutation circle.

157
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,510
It's an incantation to get a wish granted.

158
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,260
All right!

159
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,070
Watch this!

160
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,900
Incredible! Big Brother, 
that was amazing!

161
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,300
Not bad!

162
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,080
Major Hughes!

163
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,680
Hey there! I've come to pick you up.

164
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,360
It's your birthday today, right, Ed?

165
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,480
Now that you mention it...

166
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,330
How would you know 
something like that?

167
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,270
I <i>am</i> with the research department, you know.

168
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,750
Come on, let's go to my house. My wife is waiting.

169
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,670
You too there, little lady.

170
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,170
A celebration is more fun 
if you share it with everyone!

171
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,180
Come on in!

172
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,380
Thank you all for coming.

173
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,760
This is my wife, Gracia.

174
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,100
Your stomach's so big!

175
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,200
Oh, my goodness!

176
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,350
You're going to have a baby?

177
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,720
Very shortly now.

178
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,480
There's a big fuss inside my tummy saying "I want to come out soon!"

179
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,000
Really?

180
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,990
Do you want to feel?

181
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,520
N-No!

182
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,990
Nina wants to feel!

183
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,070
Go ahead, Nina-chan.

184
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:21,990
It moved!

185
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,050
Incredible! Incredible!

186
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,720
Okay then, does anyone want refills on their tea?

187
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,800
Oh, thanks!

188
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,720
Gracia!

189
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,280
Honey, <i>uma</i>—

190
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,260
<i>Uma</i>? [horse]

191
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,560
<i>Umareru</i>! [the baby's coming]

192
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,880
I-It can't be...! 
The due date isn't here yet!

193
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,660
Well, the baby wants to come out already.

194
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,900
A doctor! 
We have to get to a doctor!

195
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,470
Th-There's a blizzard!

196
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
In that case, I'll bring a doctor here!

197
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,250
Sit tight, Gracia!

198
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,230
J-Just a sec—

199
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,170
Sorry about this, everyone.

200
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,800
Gracia-san, I brought some hot water!

201
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,050
Thank you. 
Set it there on the floor.

202
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,400
Wh-What else?

203
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,430
Let' see... I suppose 
we'll need a lot of towels.

204
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,780
Towels, you say? All right!

205
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,150
The doctor sure is taking a long time.

206
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,880
Yeah, with all this snow...

207
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,950
I can't take any more! I'm dying!

208
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,830
Brother! Gracia-san said she's going to die!

209
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,910
Sh-She couldn't be...!

210
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,040
She's not dead, is she?

211
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,040
Mama-san!

212
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,130
You idiot! She's just lost consciousness, right?!

213
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,160
But if you think about it like alchemy,

214
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,560
there's a considerable cost in creating a new life!

215
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,970
Childbirth isn't alchemy, you know!

216
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,980
Th-Thank goodness she's alive! Are you all right, Gracia-san?

217
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,520
Dammit, what should we do?!

218
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,700
How can there be nothing 
we can do at a time like this?!

219
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,320
Big Brother,

220
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,030
the water is cold.

221
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,030
Ah, okay.

222
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,410
Brother! What did you just do?

223
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,830
N-Nothing...

224
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,950
N-Nothing? But where's the transmutation circle?!

225
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,720
Then how did the water get hot?

226
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,200
How would I know?! 
Must've been force of mind!

227
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,840
Here it comes!

228
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,930
What should we do?!

229
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,050
Isn't the doctor here yet?!

230
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,950
Outstanding! Outstanding, Gracia!

231
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,000
Thanks to everybody.

232
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm really, really grateful.

233
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,200
W-We didn't do anything.

234
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,200
That's not true.

235
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,150
You stayed at my side.

236
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:37,730
This alchemy stuff—turns out it wasn't any help at all, huh?

237
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,770
In contrast, mothers are 
something awesome, huh?

238
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:47,480
They can do something an alchemist wouldn't be able to do in a hundred years.

239
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,450
The same goes for our mother.

240
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,000
Al?

241
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:01,000
I wonder if I was that warm and soft when I was born.

242
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,760
O-Of course you were!

243
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,670
Really?

244
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:22,230
After that, we became 
much more absorbed in alchemy.

245
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,270
It was all we could do, wishing to take back the bodies we were born with.

246
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,500
Come to think of it, Brother,

247
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,050
you heated that water before without using a transmutation circle, huh?

248
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,960
Yeah. That situation was something out of the ordinary, though.

249
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,100
Even so, it was still 
incredible of you, Brother.

250
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,780
I'll have to keep at it too.

251
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,550
W-Well then, I'll quiz you.

252
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,610
The test was drawing ever nearer.

253
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:03,920
Every year, the test is held in the order of written exam, then interview, and then practical skills.

254
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,150
I can't say anything about 
how many people will be taking it,

255
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,220
but each year, there are only one or two people who pass.

256
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,230
You mean, that's all?

257
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,660
Um, what kind of things do they do during the interview?

258
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,580
In my case, all they did was a question-and-answer session,

259
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,800
but I understand that there are also physical examinations, depending on the person.

260
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,130
A physical examination, huh?

261
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,720
And another thing...

262
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,280
At the practical skills test,

263
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,500
about half the people brought the results of their research, like I did,

264
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,220
and about half showed off 
their transmuting on the spot.

265
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,700
What are you guys going to do?

266
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,730
I'm at a loss. What are we going 
to do for the practical skills test?

267
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,350
What if they do a physical exam before then?

268
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,740
They'll find out that the inside of this armor is empty.

269
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,250
Hey, I'm sure that Lt. Col. Mustang is thinking up something for us.

270
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,200
I sure hope so.

271
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,500
As we embraced our uneasiness, the day of the test finally came.

272
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,190
We will now begin the 
preliminary examination.

273
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,700
Begin!

274
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,370
Big Brothers! How did it go?

275
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,630
I didn't make it to the last question.

276
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,850
I got through all of it,

277
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,090
but next comes the interview.

278
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,680
I never would've expected the younger brother to pass the written too.

279
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,220
Is there a problem?

280
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,900
The interview...

281
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,480
You can't mean it!

282
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,240
I can't accept this!

283
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,240
Why? Why would you tell me 
not to go through the interview?!

284
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,950
If you wish to go any further 
while still concealing your past,

285
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:18,950
that's the only thing you can do.

286
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,510
But I want to stay together with my brother!

287
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,710
It's okay, Al.

288
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,560
It's like Old Lady Pinako said.

289
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,800
State Alchemists get rounded up 
whenever war breaks out.

290
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,580
Sometimes they have to use 
their alchemy to harm others

291
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,640
for the good of the people.

292
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,140
Passing equals "dog of the military."

293
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,220
But still!

294
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,440
It'll be enough for me alone 
to become a State Alchemist.

295
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,730
I'll make sure I become one and grant you your wish.

296
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,000
Brother...

297
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:15,220
A golden three-legged stool? 
Why doesn't it fall over like that?

298
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,720
Take a seat. If you are a true alchemist,

299
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,720
the chair will not refuse you.

300
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,480
Alchemist, at no time 
allow yourself to be afraid!

301
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,900
Very well.

302
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,240
So then, let's hear your 
motivations for taking the test.

303
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,740
I-It's because...

304
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,000
It's because...?

305
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,710
I made a promise!

306
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,340
I told the only other 
member of my family

307
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,890
that I would make sure 
I became a State Alchemist!

308
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,850
Al...

309
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,360
We chose the right path, didn't we?

310
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:17,320
I don't know. But the one thing 
I am sure about...

311
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,950
is that I want to touch you once again, Brother.

312
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,330
It's strange, huh?

313
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,340
Here we are, always so near each other,

314
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,840
but I can't even remember 
what it feels like to touch you,

315
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,750
or the warmth of your body.

316
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,340
And then, the morning 
of the practical skills test...

317
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,550
I'm off.

318
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,300
Big Brother...

319
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,600
Nina...

320
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,060
Big Brother, here.

321
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,450
It's an incantation 
to grant your wish!

322
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,800
Thanks, Nina!

323
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:21,800
We now offer you all of the matter that exists within these premises.

324
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,810
Please make use of it to 
transmute whatever you like.

325
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,980
Whatever I like?

326
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,630
What on earth should I do in order to pass?

327
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,560
It is a magnificent article,

328
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,210
but the fact that he's used up all of his strength is, well...

329
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,120
Is he serious?!

330
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,710
I'll go next.

331
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,590
<i>Trees and water?</i>

332
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,880
I hope Big Brother is all right.

333
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,850
He has your incantation, Nina, so he'll be fine.

334
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,860
Nicely done.

335
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,550
He made paper and hydrogen 
out of the wood and water, huh?

336
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:33,830
This isn't good!

337
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,420
So he can do it without a transmutation circle...

338
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,670
An underage alchemist, huh?

339
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,100
Intriguing.

340
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,200
Wow! How amazingly beautiful!

341
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,730
Edward Elric

342
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,730
Edward Elric

343
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,730
State Alchemist

344
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,730
State Alchemist

345
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,730
Certification Examination

346
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,730
Certification Examination

347
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,730
PASS

348
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,730
PASS

349
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,290
Al...

350
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,040
I'm going to stop all my wavering!

351
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,550
I'm going to just look straight ahead 
and race forward!

352
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:05,000
If I dead-end, I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.

353
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,260
Someday, no matter what,

354
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,970
I'm going to return you 
back to the way you were!

355
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,980
When you do, Brother, 
<i>your</i> body will be there with me!

356
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:21,840
Older Brother - 12

357
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:21,840
Older Brother - 12

358
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:21,840
Younger Brother - 11

359
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:21,840
Younger Brother - 11

360
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,700
With you always in my sight, I can manage to draw breath

361
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,700
itsumo no shisen ni kimi ga ite kokyuu ga dekiru

362
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:43,100
And for me, that ought to be enough in itself, and yet...

363
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:43,100
boku ni totte nara sore dake de mou juubun na hazu na no ni

364
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:51,000
All little old me ever does is repeat the same old mistakes

365
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:51,000
chippoke na boku wa kurikaesu ayamachi bakari

366
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,460
How much strength do I need to come by

367
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,460
dore hodo tsuyosa wo te ni shitara

368
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,430
before I can get by without hurting anything?

369
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,430
nanimo kizutsukezu ni sumu no?

370
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,960
I am not going to stray, I'm going to trust this love,

371
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,960
mayowazu ni kono ai wo,

372
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,770
and with it I will go on living!

373
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,770
shinjikite yuku

374
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,330
I'm going to take these wounds,

375
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,330
fusagaranu

376
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,020
the ones that will not close, and squeeze them tight!

377
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,020
kizuguchi mo gyutto dakishimete

378
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,280
The two of us must keep on walking,

379
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,280
futari wa arukitsuzukeru

380
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,160
The two of us must keep on walking,

381
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,160
futari wa arukitsuzukeru

382
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,250
since we can never return again

383
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,250
ato ni wa modorenai kara

384
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:29,300
Even now, deep within my heart,

385
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:29,300
ima demo kono mune no oku,

386
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:35,250
I still feel the pain of this indelible sin

387
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:35,250
kesenai tsumi wa itamu kedo

388
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:35,510
Darling

389
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,600
Darling

390
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,960
Night of the Chimera's Cry

391
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,910
Night of the Chimera's Cry

392
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,980
Night of the Chimera's Cry

393
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,260
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

394
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,330
Episode 7: "Night of the Chimera's Cry"

395
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,900
Nina...
