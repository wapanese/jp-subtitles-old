1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,730
Ed! Al! Hurry, hurry!

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,140
This chromium-molybdenum steel spanner set,

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,000
the hydraulic torque wrench, and that micrometer, please!

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,490
Okay!

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,070
Oh, and pick me out whichever ultra-hard tip drill and bit you think is suitable!

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,490
Okay, you got it!

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,780
Just what you'd expect to 
find in a tool store in Central!

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,390
Their selection is far different 
from what's out in the country!

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,450
Ah, I can't get over how good the walnut handle on this screwdriver feels under my fingers!

10
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,710
Say, are you still buying things, Winry?

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,540
Don't you think this is a bit much in the way of souvenirs for your grandma?

12
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,430
But you said you'd buy me anything, didn't you?!

13
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,430
Isn't that right, Ed?

14
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:36,720
Yeah.

15
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,360
Ah! Those are high-carbon chromium-steel cutting pliers, aren't they?

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,400
They'll cut through anything and never rust!

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,720
Can I buy these as well?

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,270
Yeah.

19
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,110
Mister!

20
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,060
Would you throw in this sewing machine oil too?

21
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,330
Sure!

22
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:53,820
Here!

23
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,780
This is for you.

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,950
Without me around, make sure you take care of your Automail!

25
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,170
Edward-san,

26
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,420
Lt. Col. Mustang wants to see you.

27
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,590
A mission for me?

28
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,840
Yeah. Now that you're a State Alchemist,

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,320
you'll be called upon to go on missions, 
so be ready for this.

30
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,370
Lt. Hawkeye?

31
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,100
Yes, sir.

32
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,600
Here are your orders and materials.

33
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,770
Fullmetal Alchemist Edward Elric.

34
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,180
The above-mentioned is hereby ordered to inspect the coal mine at Youswell.

35
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,320
Stuff like this is the job of a State Alchemist?

36
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,570
It includes investigating the mined resources.

37
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,270
As an alchemist, you have knowledge of ores, right?

38
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,450
This is your first mission, so I arranged for your task to be simple.

39
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,000
But don't let yourself get careless just because of that.

40
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,790
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

41
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,390
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

42
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,430
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

43
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:12,480
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

44
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,990
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

45
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,990
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

46
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,990
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

47
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,990
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

48
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:25,460
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

49
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:25,460
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

50
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:25,460
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

51
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:25,460
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

52
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:25,660
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

53
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:25,660
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

54
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:25,660
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

55
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:25,660
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

56
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,460
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

57
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,460
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

58
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,460
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

59
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:34,500
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

60
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:34,500
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

61
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,460
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

62
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,460
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

63
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,210
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

64
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,210
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

65
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,210
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

66
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,210
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

67
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,930
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

68
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,930
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

69
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,330
Looking at the sky, 
thinking tomorrow must be coming,

70
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,330
asu ga kuru hazu no sora wo mite

71
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:54,830
it's too much for my captivated heart to take

72
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:54,830
mayou bakari no kokoro mote amashite iru

73
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,580
As a bird flutters along beside me,

74
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,580
katawara no tori ga habataita

75
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:05,680
I wonder where he managed to find his light

76
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:05,680
doko ka hikari wo mitsukerareta no ka na

77
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,580
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

78
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,580
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

79
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,120
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

80
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,120
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

81
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,120
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

82
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,120
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

83
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:16,290
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

84
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:16,290
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

85
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:23,680
And leave me at the highest place there is,

86
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:23,680
And leave me at the highest place there is,

87
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:23,680
soshite ichiban takai tokoro de

88
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:23,680
soshite ichiban takai tokoro de

89
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,570
far away from kindness?

90
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,570
okizari ni shite, yasashisa kara toozakete

91
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:38,940
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

92
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:38,940
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

93
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:47,780
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

94
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:47,780
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

95
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,950
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,950
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

97
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,500
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

98
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,500
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

99
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,500
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

101
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,480
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

102
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,480
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

103
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,050
The Dog of the Military's 
Silver Watch

104
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,050
The Dog of the Military's 
Silver Watch

105
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,200
It's almost like the whole train was reserved, huh?

106
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,000
Traveling by train is nice, huh? All you have to do is sit, and—

107
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,880
Al...

108
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,560
This is my job, now that 
I'm a dog of the military.

109
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,020
You didn't have to come along too.

110
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,660
Are you still saying that?

111
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,480
I'll always be together 
with you, Brother! After all...

112
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,590
You're coming back to the village sometime, right?

113
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,480
No, we're not going back.

114
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,450
Ed...

115
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,740
Winry, there's no longer any home for us to return to.

116
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,830
Sure enough.

117
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,840
Brother, it's coming into view!

118
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,800
So that's the last town to the east, 
Youswell Coal Mine.

119
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,600
For a coal mine, I thought there'd be more activity.

120
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,260
Everyone looks burned-out.

121
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,800
It doesn't look like there's much to see here either.

122
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,170
Al, let's do this inspection quickly and go home.

123
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,330
Whoa, sorry!

124
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,330
Oww!

125
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,860
Oh, are you tourists?!

126
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,740
Where are you from?!
Have you eaten? Where are you staying?

127
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,100
Wh-Who are you?!

128
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,100
Pop! We've got visitors!

129
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,750
Huh? What'd you say?

130
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,000
Visitors! Visitors! 
Some big spenders are here!

131
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,250
Big spenders?

132
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,200
Nice of you to come!

133
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,210
I'm the inn's manager, Halling!

134
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,130
Yeah, sorry the place is so dusty.

135
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,430
The coal mine's wages are pretty low.

136
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,800
But with this place, 
I've got two irons in the fire.

137
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,560
Now then, overnight 
accommodations for two?

138
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,310
What are your rates?

139
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,560
They're steep!

140
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,060
Not to worry. Despite how we look, we have plenty of money.

141
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,020
200,000.

142
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,090
WHAT?!

143
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,090
WHAT?!

144
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:42,130
WHAT?!

145
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:42,130
WHAT?!

146
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:42,170
WHAT?!

147
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:42,170
WHAT?!

148
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:42,210
WHAT?!

149
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:42,210
WHAT?!

150
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:42,250
WHAT?!

151
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:42,250
WHAT?!

152
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:42,300
WHAT?!

153
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:42,300
WHAT?!

154
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:42,340
WHAT?!

155
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:42,340
WHAT?!

156
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,070
WHAT?!

157
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,070
WHAT?!

158
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,740
200,000?! Don't be ridiculous! 
That much for just a night's stay?!

159
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,540
Ours is the highest-class inn in all of Youswell, such that it is.

160
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,490
Besides, it's the same price no matter where you go!

161
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,960
We haven't had any guests in a long time! 
We have to soak you good!

162
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,780
It's not enough.

163
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,800
Winry had us buy all of those presents for her grandma, after all.

164
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
There's nothing else we can do. 
At this point...

165
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,690
Incredible! It's the way it used to be!

166
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,260
It looks brand-new!

167
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,400
Is there anything else I can fix?

168
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,340
Here, if I could ask you to.

169
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,980
It's something I hold dear, but accidentally broke.

170
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,240
What, you still haven't thrown that away?

171
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,500
You so rarely buy me anything, after all.

172
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,360
All right, let me handle it!

173
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,470
Thank goodness!

174
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,200
That's pretty nice, Hostess!

175
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,040
How delightful! To think that our first guest in so long would be an alchemist!

176
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,800
I took a crack at it once too,

177
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,540
but I didn't have the talent for it, so I gave it up.

178
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,840
Say, what did you come to Youswell for? There's nothing here for anyone to see.

179
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,870
I'm here on business. 
I came to inspect the coal mine.

180
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,150
An inspection?

181
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,810
You're with the military?

182
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,150
I am... a State Alchemist, after all.

183
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,110
That hurt! What was that for?!

184
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,490
We don't have any food or beds to give to any dogs of the military!

185
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,530
Are you a soldier too?

186
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,580
Uh, no...

187
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,290
He's got nothing to do with them!

188
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,790
We just got together on the train here!

189
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,640
Okay, then.

190
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,540
You can go get yourself eaten by dogs!

191
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,490
That was some incredible hatred, huh?

192
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,640
Well, sure it was! Everyone hates military people, after all!

193
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,640
That guy Yoki, who supervises this place, is a fiend for money. He's the worst!

194
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:39,980
Yoki?

195
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,610
And now, he's joined by that State Alchemist.

196
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,940
"Alchemist, be thou for the People."

197
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,960
That's both common sense to them, and their pride.

198
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,360
That's what I've come to learn.

199
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,360
Mister...

200
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,370
I can't stand those who sell their souls to the military in exchange for special privileges.

201
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,950
I'm starving...

202
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,650
Winry, you could worry about the 
human part instead of the machine

203
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,250
once in a while too, you know.

204
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,550
She does worry about you, Brother.

205
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,220
I snuck this out for you.

206
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,000
Al...

207
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,060
I can't eat, after all.

208
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,060
Soldiers really are despised, huh?

209
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,600
Well, I'm prepared for that.

210
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,280
Maybe I should get certified too, 
as a State Alchemist.

211
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,780
No, you shouldn't.

212
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,980
It's bad enough that I have to go through this by myself.

213
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,040
Besides, I really have become a dog of the military, huh?

214
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,660
Brother...

215
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,370
Stand aside!

216
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,830
Your shop is as filthy as ever, Halling.

217
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,370
Well, well, if it isn't Lt. Yoki. 
Welcome to my decrepit establishment.

218
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,840
Enough pleasantries.

219
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,080
The taxes on your place are overdue.

220
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,250
And it's not just you, I could say the same for the whole town.

221
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,350
I apologize. My earnings are so little.

222
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,100
That is because your work is so poor.

223
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,940
What?!

224
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,100
You're the ones who lowered our wages, you know!

225
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,700
On top of that, you raised our taxes!

226
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,280
Lt. Yoki has been placed in charge of this coal mine by Central!

227
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,540
Shut up! You just took the money that we sweat bullets to earn

228
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,620
and used it to bribe them to promote you, didn't you?!

229
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:25,900
Hmph! So why don't you try offering tribute to me?

230
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,600
The world is not a place where everything is provided for you on a silver platter.

231
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,350
You bastard! I can't put up 
with any more of this today!

232
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,400
Nicely done, Lyra.

233
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,990
It seems that the stories of this shop

234
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,720
becoming a hangout for troublemakers have turned out to be true.

235
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,900
In that case, I will have to think about suspending your business license.

236
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,740
What?!

237
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,160
Screw you!

238
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,490
You brat!

239
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,500
Khayal!

240
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,350
Make an example of him. Hurt him just a little.

241
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,790
Stop!

242
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,180
Wh-Who are you?!

243
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,900
I heard the Lieutenant would be coming by,

244
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,020
so I thought I'd say hello.

245
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,810
I-Is that...

246
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,770
Who is this kid, Lieutenant?

247
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,400
You idiot! You don't even 
know about State Alchemists?!

248
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,990
They're an organization under 
the direct control of the Führer!

249
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,350
Oh, my, how terribly 
rude of my subordinate!

250
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,270
I am Yoki, the one who runs this town.

251
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,830
Er, what business might you have in coming to our rural town?

252
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,870
Oh, I'm just here to conduct an inspection.

253
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,700
An inspection?

254
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,650
If only you had contacted me, 
I would've sent someone to meet you.

255
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:58,880
You must be exhausted, right? 
Come, come, please stay at my mansion!

256
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,010
Miserable dogs of the military!

257
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,300
Congratulations, Mustang-kun.

258
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,020
I hear you're going to 
become a full colonel soon.

259
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,180
Hawkeye-kun, I hear you're going to be promoted to 1st Lieutenant too.

260
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,560
Thank you so much, General Hakuro.

261
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,900
I wonder, once your authority increases,

262
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,030
if you would go to the Eastern Command
Center and take charge of it for a while?

263
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,910
Oh, you're demoting me?

264
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,070
I suppose having someone like me around Central does—

265
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,070
What are you talking about?

266
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,250
This isn't a demotion. It's a transfer to a higher post, <i>Colonel</i> Mustang.

267
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,880
However, I've heard there are a good number of untrustworthy folks in the Eastern Division.

268
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,930
Be sure to watch yourself.

269
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,500
I am greatly honored that a State Alchemist 
should come visit my house.

270
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,760
Oh, yes indeed. Since we have such an exceptional alchemist among us,

271
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,100
Lyra, have him take 
a look at your alchemy.

272
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,260
Yes, sir.

273
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,980
Nah, I saw it earlier.

274
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,550
She liquefied the air around her, 
reduced its volume,

275
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,280
and then all at once vaporized it again, 
producing a shockwave.

276
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,230
The light came from the extreme heat that was created by the forced compression, to maintain entropy.

277
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,620
You figured all that out 
with just a glance?

278
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,360
I, too, would like to be certified as a State Alchemist

279
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,400
and become like you, Edward-sama.

280
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,630
Like me?

281
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,660
Yes.

282
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,630
It is my dream to become an outstanding alchemist, 
and do all that I can for the state.

283
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,020
Now, now, please feel free to eat up.

284
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,140
I hope that our rural cooking will agree with you.

285
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,960
You eat well, huh?

286
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,830
Despite the town being in this shape...

287
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,960
Oh, you embarrass me! 
The tax collecting has not been going well,

288
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,360
and I don't know 
what I'm going to do.

289
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,320
On top of that, there are so many 
barbaric residents here, as you saw earlier.

290
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,870
You mean, all they do is assert their rights and neglect their duty to pay their taxes?

291
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:51,220
Oh, indeed, Edward-sama, 
you are a man of understanding.

292
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,760
You can express all the reasoning of the world 
in terms of equivalent exchange,

293
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,950
the basis of alchemy, you see.

294
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,380
Rights come with responsibilities, don't they?

295
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,250
Certainly! Mm, most wonderful!

296
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,500
As such, I wonder if you would accept this,

297
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,730
by way of the reasoning of the world?

298
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:09,640
Lyra?

299
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,440
It is only a small token. 
Please accept it.

300
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,650
Is this what you would call a bribe?

301
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,550
That's far too direct a way of putting it.

302
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,650
If you'd like, call it an equivalent exchange.

303
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,360
And if you would please consider the matter of the inspection...

304
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,240
I'll think about it.

305
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,680
I should have known that you would be so understanding, Edward-sama!

306
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,750
The folks in town should start 
behaving themselves soon enough,

307
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,050
so if you would care to wait briefly.

308
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,050
I wonder if Brother is all right on his own.

309
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,640
Hey, what's going on?

310
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,810
Khayal! Khayal!

311
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,070
Let go of me! Khayal is still in there!

312
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,160
You can't, boss! It's too dangerous! 
There's no telling when it'll collapse!

313
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,300
Leave me alone! Let go of me!

314
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,240
Boss!

315
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,240
Khayal!

316
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,170
Khayal! Khayal!

317
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,600
Khayal! Khayal, where are you?!

318
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,180
Khayal! Khayal!

319
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,670
Daddy!

320
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,100
Daddy...

321
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,560
Is this their doing?

322
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,600
Mm-hmm.

323
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,070
Say, you're a cracker-jack alchemist, right?

324
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,200
So then, transmute some gold for us!

325
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,570
Then you can help my pop...

326
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,000
You could save the whole town for us!

327
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,580
I can't.

328
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,700
Why not?! You don't lose anything!

329
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,120
The basis of alchemy is equivalent exchange.

330
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,330
I have neither the duty nor the obligation to do anything for this town.

331
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,520
Are you telling us to bribe you as well?!

332
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,800
And you call yourself an alchemist?!

333
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,890
"Alchemist, be thou for the People," huh?

334
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,050
Transmuting gold is a serious offense.

335
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,870
If I get caught, I'll be stripped of 
my State Alchemist certification,

336
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,260
and sent to prison.

337
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,540
So, do it so no one finds out!

338
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,130
Even if I do make gold, it'll just be taken in taxes, and that'll be the end of it.

339
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,810
If you're really that hard up,

340
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:36,060
why don't you leave this town and go find some other work?

341
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,410
Kid,

342
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,750
you may not understand this,

343
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,630
but this place is our home, and our coffin.

344
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:53,130
This is your home and coffin, huh?

345
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,010
Brother!

346
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:58,010
Al, we burned down our home ourselves.

347
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,020
We have nowhere to return to, 
and that's all right by us.

348
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,440
But for people who do have somewhere they call home,

349
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,480
they have to look out for it.

350
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,450
Al, what you see here will be our secret.

351
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,370
Brother...

352
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,880
You want to buy the coal mine?!

353
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,710
Yeah! I want you to include everything from the mine to the trade routes.

354
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,260
Is that okay?

355
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:37,100
Well... even at the request of a State Alchemist, that's just something I couldn't...

356
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,130
I see. That's a shame.

357
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,140
And here I got all this money ready...

358
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,150
I-Is that...

359
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,280
all gold?!

360
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,800
Upon investigation, 
it turns out that this mine

361
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,440
had unexploited elements that we use in alchemy research.

362
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,320
I don't want to turn it 
over to anyone else.

363
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,820
Is this enough?

364
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,030
Don't be absurd!

365
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:03,350
However, my selling the mine that 
I was entrusted by the state to govern

366
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,210
for my own profit will look a little...

367
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:09,780
It's all right! This gold doesn't appear on any records,

368
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,140
so as long as you keep your lips sealed, 
you can get by without anyone else knowing.

369
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,130
Still...

370
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,170
I know!

371
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:20,750
Please write up a memo handing over all authority over the coal mine for no charge.

372
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,050
By doing that, this will be 
all yours, Lieutenant Yoki.

373
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,150
Why?!

374
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,400
Why are you stopping me?!

375
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,990
I just am! I will not allow you to fight!

376
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,420
But they were the ones who demolished the store!

377
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,200
It's just one store.

378
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,570
Don't get so fired up.

379
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,250
Hi, everybody! I'm here to cheer up 
those gloomy faces of yours!

380
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,100
What are you doing here?!

381
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,630
Now, now, is that any way to 
talk to the manager of this place?

382
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,550
Manager?! Why, you! 
What have you—

383
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,790
As you can see, this is the title deed for the mining, trade, management,

384
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,470
and all other rights 
to this coal mine.

385
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,300
What?!

386
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,810
In other words, right now, 
this coal mine belongs to me.

387
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:07,810
Nevertheless...

388
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,420
I have to go back to Central.

389
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,950
It would be a nuisance to have to 
carry this title deed back with me.

390
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,820
What to do?

391
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,030
Don't tell me you're 
trying to sell that to us!

392
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,270
It'll cost an arm and a leg!

393
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,000
Whenever you wish to gain anything,

394
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,790
you have to pay for it with something of appropriate value, you see.

395
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:29,000
After all, not only is this title deed written on high-grade parchment,

396
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
it also has gold leaf trim.

397
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,650
What's more, the box 
features finely crushed jade,

398
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,760
in a nonchalant yet luxurious design.

399
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,320
Yeah, this is real craftsmanship, all right.

400
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,350
Oh yeah, and the key is made of sterling silver.

401
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,680
Gee, I would roughly estimate that it's worth 200,000.

402
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,560
200,000?! For the deed to the coal mine?!

403
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,080
200,000?!

404
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,120
That's all?!

405
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:55,400
Come to mention it, the foreman's inn 
cost 200,000, didn't it?

406
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,320
How about I spend the night and we call it even?

407
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,580
Equivalent exchange, huh?

408
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,570
But our inn has been...

409
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,200
Huh? Well then, 
what's that over there?

410
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,480
Our shop!

411
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,030
How can this be?!

412
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,050
This will be enough to 
cover me staying here, right?

413
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,550
Yeah, of course it will.

414
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,630
Okay, then it's an equivalent exchange!

415
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,550
Edward-sama!

416
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,240
Wh-What's going on here?!

417
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,770
The gold bars that I got from you 
have all turned to stone!

418
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,360
Gold bars? Why, whatever are you talking about?

419
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,770
Please don't play dumb!

420
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,770
I traded you that title deed 
for a mountain of gold bars!

421
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:40,450
Huh? You handed over the deed free of charge, didn't you?

422
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,780
Look, I even have the memo here.

423
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,960
Y-You swindled me!

424
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,750
"Swindled" makes it sound so scandalous. It was a legitimate transaction.

425
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,250
The transaction is invalid! Lyra!

426
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,010
Alchemist, be thou for the People!

427
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,090
I don't much care for you using 
alchemy for your own interests!

428
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,320
You're a State Alchemist, aren't you?!

429
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,400
Why would you go against what the military is doing?!

430
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,440
I never sold my soul to them.

431
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,600
Why, you...

432
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,270
Get the title deed back from—

433
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,270
Yoki-sama...

434
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,510
You shouldn't take other people's personal property from them by force, huh?

435
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:02,560
Never underestimate the strength of a coal mining man, Lieutenant!

436
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,240
Saké! Saké! Bring us some saké!

437
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,250
Say, honey, isn't the shop 
a little better than before?

438
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,790
Yeah. He really did a number here...

439
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:23,260
Edward Elric, the Fullmetal Alchemist.

440
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,900
This is the report from Edward Elric.

441
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,680
Thanks.

442
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,020
I hear this will provide the chance to reevaluate Youswell Coal Mine

443
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,180
and the personnel at the Eastern Command Center who oversee it.

444
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,550
Really?

445
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,850
That'll probably make it 
a little easier to live out east.

446
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,940
Rejoice! Even if we are relocated, we'll be able to take it easy.

447
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,820
Don't tell me you meant for 
this to happen from the start!

448
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:50,770
Perhaps. More importantly, it would be nice 
if the women in the east were pretty.

449
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:54,950
Also, their reputations are quickly spreading throughout the east.

450
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,460
They're saying that there is a champion of the people among the dogs of the military.

451
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,960
Three Years Later

452
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,960
Three Years Later

453
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,960
Older Brother - 15

454
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,960
Older Brother - 15

455
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,960
Younger Brother - 14

456
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,960
Younger Brother - 14

457
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,720
Edward Elric?

458
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,640
Yeah, I've heard of him.

459
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,340
So, what kind of guy is he?

460
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,240
According to the stories, 
despite being a State Alchemist,

461
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,550
he's a friend to the common man.

462
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,960
He must be a fairly 
upstanding man then, huh?

463
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,310
But they also say he's short, like a little bean sprout.

464
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,720
Who are you calling "miniature size"?!

465
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,720
Stop that, Brother!

466
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,240
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

467
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,240
Brother! If you keep running like that,

468
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,690
you'll never keep up the strength to reach the town of Liore!

469
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:35,740
With you always in my sight, I can manage to draw breath

470
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:35,740
itsumo no shisen ni kimi ga ite kokyuu ga dekiru

471
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:43,140
And for me, that ought to be enough in itself, and yet...

00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:43,140

00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,500

477
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,470

479
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,000
I am not going to stray, I'm going to trust this love,

480
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,000

481
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,810
and with it I will go on living!

483
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,370
I'm going to take these wounds,

485
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:11,060

00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:17,200
The two of us must keep on walking,

futari wa arukitsuzukeru

491
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:23,290
since we can never return again

493
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:29,340
Even now, deep within my heart,

00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:35,290

Psiren, the Phantom Thief

501
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,950

Episode 10: "Psiren, the Phantom Thief"

00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,300
Say, Brother, isn't it strange how there are people

505
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,530
who you can't tell 
whether they're good or bad?
