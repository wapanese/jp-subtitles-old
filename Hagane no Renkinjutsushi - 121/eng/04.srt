1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,190
On the day we decided to depart,

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,600
we burned down our house.

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,000
Al, are you sure you're okay?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,700
Yeah.

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,100
Leaving the village, I mean. 
You don't have any regrets?

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,100
What are you talking about, Brother?

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,100
We decided to do this ourselves, 
you know.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,670
Actually, I think you're the one 
who'll miss it more.

9
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,110
I'm all excited.

10
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,890
After all, I'm going to 
become a State Alchemist! Me!

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,660
I feel the same way.

12
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,700
I'm going to get your body fixed, after all.

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,520
That's all right. You just need to worry about yourself.

14
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,610
Still, how do we get to be State Alchemists?

15
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,750
What kind of training does it take?

16
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,540
If they performed human transmutation

17
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,400
and escaped with their lives,

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,210
then I am more interested in them. 
They could make fine State Alchemists.

19
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,700
Anyhow, we're going to go meet this Roy person.

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,800
Who knows? With talent as abundant as mine is,

21
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,600
it'll be a piece of cake!

22
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,940
Are you concerned about Winry?

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,820
Nothing we can do about it.

24
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,280
It's something those two have set their minds to.

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,450
I'm sure they'll be back 
once they grow up.

26
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,380
Ed...

27
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,950
Al...

28
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,750
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

29
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:50,350
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

30
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:55,430
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

31
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:01,970
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

32
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:08,980
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

33
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:08,980
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

34
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:08,980
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

35
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:08,980
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

36
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:14,450
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

37
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:14,450
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

38
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:14,450
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

39
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:14,450
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

40
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:14,650
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

41
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:14,650
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

42
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:14,650
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

43
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:14,650
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

44
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,450
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

45
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,450
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

46
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,450
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

47
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:23,490
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

48
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:23,490
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

49
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,450
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

50
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,450
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

51
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,200
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

52
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,200
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,200

55
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,920
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

56
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,920
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

57
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,320
Looking at the sky, 
thinking tomorrow must be coming,

58
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,320
asu ga kuru hazu no sora wo mite

59
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:43,820
it's too much for my captivated heart to take

60
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:43,820
mayou bakari no kokoro mote amashite iru

61
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,570
As a bird flutters along beside me,

62
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,570
katawara no tori ga habataita

63
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:54,670
I wonder where he managed to find his light

64
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:54,670
doko ka hikari wo mitsukerareta no ka na

65
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,570
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

66
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,570
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

67
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,110
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

68
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,110
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

69
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,110
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

70
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,110
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

71
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:05,280
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

72
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:05,280
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

73
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,670
And leave me at the highest place there is,

74
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,670
And leave me at the highest place there is,

75
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,670
soshite ichiban takai tokoro de

76
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,670
soshite ichiban takai tokoro de

77
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,560
far away from kindness?

78
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,560
okizari ni shite, yasashisa kara toozakete

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:27,930
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:27,930
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

86
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,490
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,490

saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

91
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,040
Transmutation of Love

92
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,040
Transmutation of Love

93
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,040
Brother, do you know which train we're supposed to transfer to?

94
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,680
Yeah, it's coming at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.

95
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,150
Until then, let's get some sleep.

96
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,670
My bag!

97
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,370
Al!

98
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,370
That was a cinch!

99
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,560
Kids, huh? Off to bed with you now, 
like good boys!

100
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,070
What the?!

101
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,450
Why don't <i>you</i> give it a rest there, instead?!

102
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,630
Nicely done!

103
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,700
That was something else!

104
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,420
Was that strange power just now alchemy?

105
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,040
Yeah.

106
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,880
To think that boys your age could be alchemists!

107
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:47,020
In these parts, Majhal would have to be the only alchemist around.

108
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,260
Majhal?

109
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,770
Sure. It's said that he has helped others out many times with his alchemy.

110
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,750
He's quite well respected.

111
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,230
Where is this person?

112
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,120
Ah, the next village over.

113
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,190
But you'd better not go there now.

114
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,570
There's this ominous rumor going around.

115
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,620
The rumor has it that dead people

116
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,850
are coming back to life in that village and attacking the villagers.

117
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,920
Do you know about this Majhal person, Brother?

118
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,130
No, but I saw that same name among all those letters of his.

119
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,330
You mean Dad's?

120
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,130
If I remember, he wrote about human transmutation.

121
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,510
If it's the same person, 
it couldn't hurt to meet him, right?

122
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,220
Yeah! This seems like 
it's going to be a good trip.

123
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,230
You sure seem unusually happy.

124
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,840
Well, we did catch that purse-snatcher, and everyone congratulated us.

125
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,080
I'm not sure how to say this,

126
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,250
but I'm happy that our alchemy was able to help others out.

127
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,350
Brother, are you all right?

128
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,480
No, I'm not!

129
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,380
That seat was hard and bounced around something awful.

130
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,320
You weren't bothered?

131
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,390
No.

132
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,140
I'll tell you what,

133
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,020
those are some incredible decorations.

134
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,140
Is there some festival going on?

135
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,520
Yikes! That one went toward the village!

136
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,610
What are you doing here?! This place is off-limits!

137
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,050
We're in the middle of 
a fireworks rehearsal here!

138
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,540
F-Fireworks?

139
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,120
What are you talking about?!

140
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,620
The fireworks for the festival, of course!

141
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,870
I've never seen your faces before, have I?

142
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,500
What's with this guy? 
He's got a strange outfit on!

143
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:44,960
Cut it out!

144
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,710
Let's get 'em. Should be fun.

145
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,430
We got 'em!

146
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,470
They're weak!

147
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,230
What are you doing?

148
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,740
Are you Majhal?

149
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,500
Wow, this is amazing.

150
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,090
An impressive spirit bonding.

151
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,840
H-He knows about me, Brother!

152
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,930
Just what you'd expect of Hohenheim's sons.

153
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,550
Apparently, you've inherited his great talent.

154
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,560
Now then, what can I do for you?

155
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:47,070
I can't very well turn down the 
request of the sons of a dear friend.

156
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,960
We wanted to ask about the human transmutation you wrote about

157
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,070
in the letter you sent him.

158
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,880
Human transmutation?

159
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,160
You do know that it is 
forbidden by law, right?

160
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,860
Maybe so...

161
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,290
But I want to return 
Al's body back to normal.

162
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,900
The costs accompanying a human transmutation are altogether too great.

163
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,620
I know how you must feel,

164
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,010
but such an act is something that only God is allowed to perform.

165
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:21,270
Then why did you correspond with him 
about human transmutation?

166
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,150
Youthful enthusiasm...

167
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,980
I guess you would call it.

168
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,900
Majhal-sama,

169
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:37,240
I made some rose jam, 
if you'd like some.

170
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,720
I'm always grateful, Lebi.

171
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,750
Thanks.

172
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,200
Not at all.

173
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:45,900
Was there something else?

174
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,500
N-No. E-Excuse me.

175
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,600
Okay then, take care.

176
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,680
Come to mention it, there's a festival happening soon, right?

177
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,660
Yeah, the Requiem Festival.

178
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:11,940
The spirits of the dead are sent up 
on fireworks, to return them to Heaven.

179
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,900
I've heard rumors about this village.

180
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,000
They say the dead are coming back to life 
and attacking people here.

181
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,700
Does that have anything to do with it?

182
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,850
That's just a silly, baseless rumor.

183
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,210
My, my, I'm certainly having a lot of visitors today.

184
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,920
You!

185
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,540
Come on, Clause!

186
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,200
Majhal-sama, I'm really sorry about this.

187
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:40,050
Why do I have to apologize?!

188
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,330
It's their own fault for being so weak, isn't it?!

189
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,520
For boys, anyhow!

190
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,020
What?!

191
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,020
Brother, control yourself!

192
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,370
Clause, I know that you're upset about your sister's death.

193
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,230
But you were once 
such a gentle little girl.

194
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,000
What would your late sister think if she saw you now?

195
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,950
Shut up!

196
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,330
Nobody knows how I feel!

197
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,310
My sister didn't just dieâ€”

198
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,080
she was killed when that lady came back to life!

199
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,500
Came back to life?

200
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,290
Clause!

201
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,300
Hey, wait up!

202
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,610
You guys are...

203
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,490
alchemists?

204
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,060
It's been half a year 
since my sister died.

205
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,130
We didn't know the cause.

206
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,060
One of the villagers found her as they were passing by.

207
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,130
She looking like she was asleep, but she was dead.

208
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,830
And then, on the night of her funeral...

209
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,750
Clause...

210
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,860
K-Karin?!

211
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:32,710
Dad said that she was a woman who lived in this village a long time ago.

212
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,740
You know, right? The dead woman 
came back to life and killed my sister!

213
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,210
And not only her!

214
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,970
It's all because of her!

215
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,900
Look, if you're alchemists, then avenge her for me!

216
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,520
I've asked Majhal-san, 
but he won't do anything!

217
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,940
It's only natural that 
Majhal-san won't do anything.

218
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,750
That's because your story is unbelievable.

219
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,700
Besides, I'm not too wild 
about taking any revenge.

220
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,350
What are you talking about?

221
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,780
You guys are really just scared, aren't you?

222
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,860
And you call yourselves alchemists!

223
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,350
You're just a pipsqueak and an armor fanatic!

224
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,280
Pipsqueak?

225
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,670
Armor fanatic?

226
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,850
Don't you call me a pipsqueak! 
I'm still going to grow up ultra-big!

227
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,150
You're a pipsqueak now, aren't you?

228
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,100
Pipsqueak! Pipsqueak! Ultra-hyper-super-pipsqueak!

229
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,300
Shut up!

230
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,890
What about you?! If you're a girl, 
why don't you at least dress a little like one?!

231
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,060
None of your business!

232
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,700
Karin?

233
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,030
Yes, she did live here.

234
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,260
She made a living by raising flowers,

235
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,490
and she was a beautiful woman.

236
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,080
It must be twenty years ago now.

237
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:57,000
She succeeded in cultivating a very difficult blue rose.

238
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,050
Her smile at the time was simply...

239
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,800
However,

240
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,340
while she was riding in a carriage, 
shipping her blue roses to the city...

241
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,810
she fell down along the 
mountain roads and died there.

242
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,070
But they say that this Karin-san is attacking the villagers.

243
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,470
There's no way that could be.

244
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,900
The dead do not come back to life, after all.

245
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,700
And besides, even if she 
were to come back to life,

246
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,120
it's inconceivable that she would attack the other villagers.

247
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,620
What do you think, Brother?

248
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,660
It's true, dead people 
don't come back to life.

249
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,880
But supposing that someone were to perform a human transmutation...

250
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,900
The only person in this village who would be capable of that is Majhal-san.

251
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,200
Did you hear that just now?

252
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,480
Hear what?

253
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,190
We're really going to do it?

254
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:05,350
Yeah, we're going to catch this 
Karin zombie with our own hands!

255
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,340
What, are you afraid?!

256
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,860
Someone else will probably get killed if this keeps up!

257
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,370
Y-Yeah, but...

258
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,080
Jeez, what are you doing, old lady?

259
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,250
I'm sorry.

260
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,950
I don't need your money, just go, would you? 
You can't just stay here all day

261
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,090
Anyhow, we make our 
move tonight. Got that?

262
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,090
over one bowl of soup.

263
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,510
Brother!

264
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,010
Wait up!

265
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,640
What's wrong, Al? Are you scared?

266
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,520
It's not that. There aren't really any zombies around, right?

267
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,400
Don't be ridiculous.

268
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,300
If the rumors are true, then it could only be by human transmutation.

269
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,110
It's worth checking out.

270
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,700
We did it!

271
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,030
We caught her!

272
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,160
You're hurting me, Al.

273
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,370
Oh, you guys...

274
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,290
O-Over there!

275
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,390
<i>You</i>... took my sister...

276
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,470
Clause!

277
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,080
That sound...

278
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,000
The alchemist Majhal...

279
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,830
Second-rate after all, I guess.

280
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,100
That's Majhal-sama for you!

281
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,850
Yeah, Majhal-sama, I knew you would put down that zombie for sure!

282
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,320
What's the matter, Brother?

283
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,450
That was neither a zombie 
nor a human transmutation.

284
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,700
It was the same sound that I heard that other time.

285
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,600
Majhal-sama will be cross with you,

286
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,290
wandering around his residence on your own like this.

287
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,250
And what about you?

288
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,260
Brother!

289
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,930
Wh-What is all of this?

290
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,450
Brother!

291
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,350
Brother, are you okay?

292
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,240
So, you're awake?

293
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,330
It appears that you've seen something that you shouldn't have seen.

294
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:07,050
Yeah, I saw. The identity of that zombie, that is.

295
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,330
This is your doing!

296
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,000
Yes, spirit bonding.

297
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:18,970
I take a mannequin that is the perfect likeness of Karin and bond one of the village girls to it.

298
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,220
By doing so, they were supposed to resemble a living Karin.

299
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,520
But you failed!

300
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,450
Spirits do not tend to bond to vessels that are unlike them.

301
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,680
You may think they are bonded, 
but ordinarily, they are not functional.

302
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,840
There were even those who 
slipped out of here on their own

303
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,030
and wandered around the village.

304
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,280
Do you realize what you've done?!

305
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,430
Why the hell would you do this?!

306
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:47,150
Karin was the only woman I ever loved.

307
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:53,000
No matter how many years pass since Karin's death, my scars will not heal.

308
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,900
I made up my mind

309
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,260
that I would bring Karin 
back to life through alchemy.

310
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,920
However, it was impossible for me to perform human transmutation.

311
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,500
That being the case, I wanted to at least create something that was close to Karin.

312
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,400
That's what I thought.

313
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,070
You're sick!

314
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,520
No! I just love Karin!

315
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,750
You're going to assist me now,

316
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,410
in a spiritual bonding for my love.

317
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,040
No way.

318
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:30,550
Indeed. You're just as stubborn as Hohenheim was.

319
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,510
Um, I wanted to thank you...

320
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,720
You foolish girl.

321
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,680
Stop!

322
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,320
Please stop, Majhal-sama! 
End this already!

323
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:48,180
Shut up! This has nothing to do with you!

324
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,800
Hey, do something, fast!

325
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,440
Just a little more...

326
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,700
A blue rose?

327
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:14,130
Receive this girl's spirit and smile 
upon me this time without fail, Karin!

328
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,370
No! Stop!

329
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,240
Stop, Majhal!

330
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,320
You don't understand a thing!

331
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,890
What you were seeking 
has been right next to you!

332
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,730
What are you talking about?

333
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,420
Karin-san didn't die!

334
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:38,070
After the accident, she lost her memory and lived from then on someplace else!

335
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,850
And then, twenty years later,

336
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:44,320
Karin-san got her memory back and came straight back to you.

337
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,540
But you didn't realize it was her!

338
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,000
Majhal...

339
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,600
Impossible...

340
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,200
Are you saying that this woman is Karin?

341
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:03,480
Karin was more beautiful than any other woman!

342
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,010
Like a rose!

343
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,850
Face reality!

344
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,870
Flowers wither.

345
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:12,350
But Karin-san's feelings 
toward you have not changed!

346
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,880
Silence! Say one more word, 
and I'll kill you!

347
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,640
Majhal! Majhal!

348
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,140
N-No...

349
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,710
You are not... Karin.

350
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,900
There's no way... you could be Karin.

351
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,720
What are you moping about, Al?

352
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,940
I was thinking that alchemy can also delude people.

353
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,220
Yeah, you're right.

354
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,400
Hey!

355
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,580
I'm sorry about everything.

356
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,670
You really are terrific alchemists, huh?

357
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,380
That may be so,

358
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,670
but who are you?

359
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:08,000
Don't tell me you're... Clause?!

360
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,520
What do you mean, "Ehhh!"?

361
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:23,400
You definitely look better in those clothes!

362
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,980
See ya!

363
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,700
With you always in my sight, I can manage to draw breath

364
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,700
itsumo no shisen ni kimi ga ite kokyuu ga dekiru

365
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:43,100
And for me, that ought to be enough in itself, and yet...

366
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:43,100
boku ni totte nara sore dake de mou juubun na hazu na no ni

367
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:51,000
All little old me ever does is repeat the same old mistakes

368
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:51,000
chippoke na boku wa kurikaesu ayamachi bakari

369
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,460
How much strength do I need to come by

370
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,460
dore hodo tsuyosa wo te ni shitara

371
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,430
before I can get by without hurting anything?

372
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,430
nanimo kizutsukezu ni sumu no?

373
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,960
I am not going to stray, I'm going to trust this love,

374
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,960
mayowazu ni kono ai wo,

375
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,770
and with it I will go on living!

376
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,770
shinjikite yuku

377
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,330
I'm going to take these wounds,

378
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,330
fusagaranu

379
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,020
the ones that will not close, and squeeze them tight!

380
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,020
kizuguchi mo gyutto dakishimete

381
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,280
The two of us must keep on walking,

382
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,280
futari wa arukitsuzukeru

383
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,160
The two of us must keep on walking,

384
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,160
futari wa arukitsuzukeru

385
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,250
since we can never return again

386
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,250
ato ni wa modorenai kara

387
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:29,300
Even now, deep within my heart,

388
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:29,300
ima demo kono mune no oku,

389
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:35,250
I still feel the pain of this indelible sin

390
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:35,250
kesenai tsumi wa itamu kedo

391
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:35,510
Darling

392
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,600
Darling

393
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,870
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

394
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,000
Dash! Automail

395
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,950
Dash! Automail

396
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,020
Dash! Automail

397
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:44,580
Episode 5: "Dash! Automail"

398
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,950
You wanted power too, didn't you?

399
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,240
That's what the man with the mechanical arm said to me.
