1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,230
Edward-sama! 
Is something the matter?!

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,150
It's nothing!

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,160
I told them not to disturb us...

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,740
I guess they don't trust you.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,870
You'd feel a lot better after revealing who you really are, wouldn't you?

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,750
Fletcher!

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,920
Run! Hurry!

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,130
Brother...

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,680
If they catch you, 
we won't get off easily, either!

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,030
In time, I'll clear everything up!

11
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,100
Al, let's go!

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,610
I'm sorry,

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,700
Brother...

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,870
Man cannot obtain anything 
without first sacrificing something.

15
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,480
In order to obtain anything, 
something of equal value is required.

16
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,570
That is alchemy's 
Law of Equivalent Exchange.

17
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,980
At the time, we believed that 
to be the true way of the world.

18
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,990
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

19
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,990
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

20
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,990
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

21
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,990
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

22
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:38,460
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

23
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:38,460
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

24
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:38,460
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

25
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:38,460
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

26
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:38,660
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

27
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:38,660
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

28
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:38,660
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

29
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:38,660

00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,460
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,460
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

33
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,500
and squeeze the life out of your sorrows for me

34
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,500
kanashimi no iki no ne wo tomete kure yo

35
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,460
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

36
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,460
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

37
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,210
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

38
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,210
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,210

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,930
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

42
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,930
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

43
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,330
Looking at the sky, 
thinking tomorrow must be coming,

44
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,330
asu ga kuru hazu no sora wo mite

45
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:07,830
it's too much for my captivated heart to take

46
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:07,830
mayou bakari no kokoro mote amashite iru

47
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,580
As a bird flutters along beside me,

48
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,580
katawara no tori ga habataita

49
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:18,680
I wonder where he managed to find his light

50
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:18,680
doko ka hikari wo mitsukerareta no ka na

51
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,580
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

52
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,580
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

53
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,120
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

54
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,120
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

55
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,120
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

56
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,120
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

57
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,290
Say, would you carry me along on your back as well?

58
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,290
naa, omae no se ni ore mo nosete kurenai ka?

59
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:36,680
And leave me at the highest place there is,

60
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:36,680
And leave me at the highest place there is,

61
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:36,680
soshite ichiban takai tokoro de

62
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:36,680
soshite ichiban takai tokoro de

63
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,570
far away from kindness?

64
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,570
okizari ni shite, yasashisa kara toozakete

65
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:51,940
Take the memories of distant days, tear them up with your own hands,

00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:51,940
kimi no te de kirisaite tooi hi no kioku wo

00:02:51,940 --> 00:03:00,780

72
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,500
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,500

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,480
Come on, and pierce my heart as it yearns for your love!

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,480
saa, ai ni kogareta mune wo tsuranuke

77
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,040
Land of Stones, Part 2

78
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,040
Land of Stones, Part 2

79
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,000
You promised not to use alchemy, right?

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,950
Dad didn't like it, you know.

81
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,820
Th-This is terrible!

82
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,060
Mugear-sama...

83
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,350
You two are all right!

84
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,560
And the stone? 
Is the stone all right?

85
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,270
Not to worry, it's right here.

86
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,340
You've done well 
to make it so large.

87
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,310
However, we don't 
have any more time.

88
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,030
Please start using 
that other method.

89
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,040
We don't need to use that method for the stone to—

90
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,870
Are you saying you won't follow my orders?

91
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,870
N-No...

92
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,000
There was once another man who told me the same thing.

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,910
In the end, he ran away, 
like a beaten dog.

94
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:03,760
What's that?

95
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,470
With this, even without being an alchemist, I can do this!

96
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,860
Mugear-sama!

97
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,980
Magnificent!

98
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:25,450
The real Elric brothers are said to 
have blond hair and golden eyes,

99
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,450
sons of Nash Tringham!

100
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,750
Things have sure been bustling over at the mansion, huh?

101
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,100
Oh, really?

102
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,890
You went there again, huh?

103
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,800
There's no helping you.

104
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,280
Huh? Is Elisa still here?

105
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,850
Mm-hmm. The grapevine is withering,

106
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,350
so she wanted to stay here, and she won't listen to me.

107
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,270
But her cough is terrible.

108
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,550
I just put her down.

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,200
Red water?!

110
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,200
They're condensing it, 
trying to turn it into a stone.

111
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,520
Then again, compared to the Philosopher's Stone,

112
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,710
the red-water piece is 
just a pale imitation.

113
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,990
What do you suppose he meant by "his father's dream"?

114
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,540
Probably just some goofy excuse.

115
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,470
Could it be that those two are...

116
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,180
Nash's sons?

117
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,460
Nash?

118
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,680
You mean Nash Tringham, 
the discoverer of the red water?

119
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,150
He was from this town.

120
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,160
He went to Central to 
research the red water.

121
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,690
But then, one day, 
he came back to this town.

122
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,320
Nash? Well, if it isn't Nash!

123
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,080
You've returned, huh? 
How are you?

124
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,860
This town is completely 
on the decline.

125
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,900
I think we should stop relying on gold for our way of life.

126
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,540
How's your research 
on the red water?

127
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,590
Is it coming along?

128
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,480
I gave up. 
I'll never research it again.

129
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,890
I'm not going back to Central, either.

130
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,600
What? What about your family?

131
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,440
I'm a failure,

132
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,110
both as a husband and a father.

133
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,610
Nash...

134
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,840
He'd abandoned everything he had.

135
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,480
He wouldn't tell me anything about what happened in Central.

136
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:40,230
But then the big landowner in 
this town—Mugear—came calling.

137
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,090
He approached Nash about 
his research on the red water.

138
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,970
No matter how many times you come see me, my answer is the same!

139
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,470
You're saying you'd turn your back on this town?!

140
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,810
Right now, the only thing that can produce gold is your red water!

141
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,940
As long as we have gold, 
the town will come back to life!

142
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,950
Nash-san, you're the only one 
who can save this town! Please!

143
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,950
In the end, he secluded himself inside Mugear's mine, and began to research.

144
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,490
The town once again flourished because of the gold.

145
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,170
The furnaces were aflame, goods filled the streets,

146
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,230
and life returned to the people.

147
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:30,880
However, at the same time, an illness of unknown origin began to spread.

148
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,720
Without anyone knowing 
how to treat it,

149
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,580
many, many babies 
died soon after birth.

150
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,360
And Elisa was born around then?

151
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:56,550
Shortly, an alchemist doctor named Marcoh wandered into town.

152
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:07,000
The cause of this is a toxic material called 
red water, which has seeped into the ground.

153
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,140
It glowed?!

154
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,370
Yes.

155
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,250
That light... Could it have been...

156
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:26,360
In any case, we can be sure that 
thanks to his treatment, Elisa survived.

157
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,730
I hounded Nash.

158
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,740
Answer me, Nash! If this keeps up, this will become a town of death!

159
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,740
What the hell have you done?!

160
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,460
I was in the wrong.

161
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,750
Again... Once again...

162
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,880
I'm going to end it all.

163
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,580
End it...

164
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,420
Nash...

165
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,550
After that, no one 
ever saw him again.

166
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,300
Gradually, they couldn't get any more gold,

167
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,630
and the town once again declined.

168
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,750
If those two are Nash's sons,

169
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,650
they must have come after their father.

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,900
Brother...

171
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,860
What?

172
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,450
They had no choice. The only thing those two have is their father.

173
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:21,450
They're just using their pop as 
justification for what they're doing.

174
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,290
Maybe so...

175
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,650
But aren't we doing 
something similar?

176
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,970
I know how those two feel.

177
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,520
For crying out loud!

178
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,770
All you had to do was shut up 
and use that other method...

179
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,800
Brother? What method does he mean?

180
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,730
It's simple, really.

181
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,440
Have newly pregnant women drink the red water.

182
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,250
Soon, the water will pass through the placenta and condense...

183
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,200
You don't mean...

184
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,950
Stop!

185
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,810
At the right time, you get it from them and transmute it into a stone.

186
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,960
It's a simple, reliable method.

187
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,750
My, my, you've got the same sissy streak as your father.

188
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,340
Wait!

189
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,880
I just want you to 
tell me one thing!

190
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,800
Did Dad use that method?

191
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,470
Hmph, at the last moment, he weaseled out.

192
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,480
If only he had done it, 
his life would've been spared.

193
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,230
Why, you... You said 
Dad died from illness!

194
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,550
Wait! Hey, wait!

195
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,070
I've taken care of everything.

196
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,700
Now we just have to use the real Elric brothers and put everything into action.

197
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:52,710
I doubt it will go that smoothly. 
They can be very difficult to deal with.

198
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:58,220
One or two kids won't be any 
trouble at all! Now, please wait.

199
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,470
Please wait for 
just a while longer.

200
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,880
Very well. Go on.

201
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,250
The time for this place is nigh.

202
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,620
I'm so sorry about 
those two impostors.

203
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,490
I, too, was completely 
taken in by them.

204
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,750
I feel terrible about 
adding to our impertinence,

205
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,870
but seeing as how the two of you are among the finest alchemists of our age,

206
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,210
there is a matter that I would like to request your assistance with.

207
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,210
Research on the red water?

208
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,590
Oh! You know about it? 
That will save me time explaining.

209
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,720
The truth is, I happened to overhear

210
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,720
that you are greatly interested in the Philosopher's Stone.

211
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,040
What do you think? It was made by condensing the red water.

212
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,940
You might call it a trial product for a Philosopher's Stone.

213
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,560
What am I supposed 
to do with it now?

214
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,650
I want to save Xenotime.

215
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,070
If I can regenerate the gold vein, 
no one will have to give up on this town!

216
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,100
I get it.

217
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,930
So, where are the impostors?

218
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,910
They're being held in 
an underground cell.

219
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,750
Wh-What are you doing?!

220
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,140
I'm not interested in 
any unfinished goods.

221
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,240
Executing the impostors comes first.

222
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,380
I'm not the type of person who forgives liars.

223
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,090
Oh! Then you're accepting my request?

224
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,210
With us working on it, 
this will be child's play.

225
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,700
Never mind that, I haven't 
executed anyone in a while!

226
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,250
I'm just itching for the chance!

227
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,100
Gonna come watch?

228
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,690
No, I, uh...

229
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,260
I'll pass on that.

230
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,600
Brother...

231
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,300
Hey.

232
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,600
Alphonse-san!

233
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,460
I heard that Nash Tringham was your pop.

234
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,670
What were you trying to do by carrying on his research?

235
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,150
That...

236
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,420
is Dad's water.

237
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,930
It was my duty to 
continue his research.

238
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,430
You are such a naïve bastard.

239
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:14,890
Do you know what the people in town are going through because of that toxic water?

240
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,770
Your pop knew.

241
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,150
That's why he tried to 
give up his research.

242
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,560
You can't obtain happiness by relying on the likes of red water or a Philosopher's Stone!

243
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,930
Move forward! 
Don't act so shamefully!

244
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Not now that you've 
taken on my name.

245
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,330
Al! Let's go!

246
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:48,340
Who cares? As long as the research is successful, those guys will be—

247
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,180
Those guys? 
Who are you talking about?

248
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,390
Something's been bothering me.

249
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:58,020
Wherever did the red-water 
researcher Nash Tringham go?

250
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:03,780
Nash? Ah, his research wasn't going so well, so I fired him.

251
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,840
Oh? You don't seem like someone 
so good-natured as to let somebody

252
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,780
who knew everything 
get away from you.

253
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,290
What are you trying to say?

254
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:17,370
I'm saying that I don't help murderers out, Mugear!

255
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,030
Why, you!

256
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,790
In that case, you're not 
getting out of here alive!

257
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,960
I can get any number of 
other alchemists instead!

258
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,720
A stone?!

259
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,430
There wasn't just that one?!

260
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,800
It may not be as complete as that other one...

261
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,470
Die!

262
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,230
Are you done yet?

263
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,570
What?!

264
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,250
There's plenty more 
where that came from!

265
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,030
You're kidding!

266
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,150
It's useless! Useless!

267
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,880
Equivalent exchange, my ass! Dammit!

268
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,550
I'm not done yet!

269
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,260
What is this?!

270
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,370
Now, Al!

271
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,410
Ed! Looks like you needed my help after all.

272
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,200
What?!

273
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,160
We've given up 
chasing after our dad.

274
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,960
We're going to go 
find our own way.

275
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,460
Brother!

276
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,880
Brother!

277
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,300
A secret passage?!

278
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,930
That bastard, he got away!

279
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,400
Russell, how much farther?

280
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,500
We're almost there! There's a spring where the red water comes out!

281
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,820
That miserable Mugear! He blocked our way!

282
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,900
I'm gonna drag him out of there!

283
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,330
What?!

284
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,050
I'll never surrender the spring!

285
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,750
As long as I have this water, I can continue researching!

286
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,190
I'm not afraid of 
any State Alchemist!

287
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,440
Ed!

288
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,220
Brother!

289
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,820
Now you've said it, Mugear! 
Don't you mock the State Alchemists!

290
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,100
Die!

291
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,110
Do you see now?

292
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,750
I'm on an entirely 
different level than you!

293
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,800
What's that?

294
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,280
Ed! That's enough! 
Let's get out of here!

295
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,080
Brother!

296
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,590
I won't give up this spring!

297
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,190
It's the water! 
The red water is overflowing!

298
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,980
That should hold it for now.

299
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,780
Are the other places all right?

300
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,280
The bedrock will be unstable after that shock. Let's go!

301
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,140
Now, if we can just 
stop it from coming out...

302
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,140
The trees...

303
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,460
They're absorbing the red water!

304
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,840
Brother, these kinds of trees 
were in the laboratory as well!

305
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,840
You had them absorb the red water to detoxify it?

306
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,590
Brother!

307
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,540
Those guys did it.

308
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,120
Thanks. Sorry about this.

309
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,350
Here. These are from Belsio-san.

310
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,440
Thanks!

311
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,360
Big Brother, take care!

312
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,940
Come see us again!

313
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,980
Mm-hmm, we'll come again for sure!

314
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,940
You sure you can get by in this town?

315
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,940
Really? Promise?

316
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,580
We'll accept whatever's coming to us.

317
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,070
Okay, let's do a parting handshake!

318
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,730
Working with Belsio-san, my powers will be useful.

319
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,200
Ed, are you still going to search for the Philosopher's Stone?

320
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,690
Wow, you're so big!

321
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,210
Yeah.

322
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,420
Look, how about I tell you 
how to condense a red stone?

323
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,670
What?

324
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,180
Not by way of apology,

325
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,680
it's just that I think 
you should know.

326
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,700
We don't need that stuff.

327
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,590
We'll find it on our own.

328
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,120
Count on it.

329
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,070
Ed-san! Please come again! 
We're sure to make this town better!

330
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:04,650
When you do, Big Brother, 
be taller, okay?

331
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:08,600
What?! Why, you! 
That wasn't very nice!

332
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,540
Good-bye!

333
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,000
Bye-bye!

334
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,500
Good-bye!

335
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,500
Good-bye!

336
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,110
Good-bye!

337
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,230
A letter, huh?

338
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,230
A letter?

339
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,150
Yeah. What could it be?

340
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,680
What?

341
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,900
I-It's nothing!

342
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,490
Show me! Show me! Show me!

343
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:56,080
Show me, already! 
Come on, Brother!

344
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,930
<i>"Ed,</i>

345
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,250
<i>thanks for all your help."</i>

346
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,760

00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,760
<i>and I'll try hard to follow your example, Ed."</i>

349
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,950
<i>"Well, have a nice trip."</i>

350
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:14,800
<i>"Russell."</i>

351
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:22,060
Damn, how can he be younger than me, 
and still be taller? What a joke!

352
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,960
Those two are going 
to be all right, huh?

353
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,480
Yeah. They had a nice, 
resolute look on their faces.

354
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,700
With you always in my sight, I can manage to draw breath

355
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,700
itsumo no shisen ni kimi ga ite kokyuu ga dekiru

356
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:43,100
And for me, that ought to be enough in itself, and yet...

357
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:43,100
boku ni totte nara sore dake de mou juubun na hazu na no ni

358
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:51,000
All little old me ever does is repeat the same old mistakes

359
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:51,000
chippoke na boku wa kurikaesu ayamachi bakari

360
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,460
How much strength do I need to come by

361
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,460
dore hodo tsuyosa wo te ni shitara

362
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,430
before I can get by without hurting anything?

363
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,430
nanimo kizutsukezu ni sumu no?

364
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,960
I am not going to stray, I'm going to trust this love,

365
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,960
mayowazu ni kono ai wo,

366
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,770
and with it I will go on living!

367
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,770
shinjikite yuku

368
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,330
I'm going to take these wounds,

369
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,330
fusagaranu

370
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,020
the ones that will not close, and squeeze them tight!

371
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,020
kizuguchi mo gyutto dakishimete

372
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,280
The two of us must keep on walking,

373
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,280
futari wa arukitsuzukeru

374
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,160
The two of us must keep on walking,

375
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,160
futari wa arukitsuzukeru

376
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,250
since we can never return again

377
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,250
ato ni wa modorenai kara

378
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:29,300
Even now, deep within my heart,

379
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:29,300
ima demo kono mune no oku,

380
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:35,250
I still feel the pain of this indelible sin

381
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:35,250
kesenai tsumi wa itamu kedo

382
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:35,510
Darling

383
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,600
Darling

384
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,400
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>...

385
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,960
Flame VS Fullmetal

386
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,910
Flame VS Fullmetal

387
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,980
Flame VS Fullmetal

388
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,770
Episode 13: "Flame VS Fullmetal"

389
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,820
Colonel Roy Mustang, State Alchemist.

390
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,560
Title: "Flame."

391
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,320
He's probably stronger than Brother.

392
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,990
Oh, no he's not!
