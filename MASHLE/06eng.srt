1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,440
<i>Mash and the gang were
supposed to defeat forest scorpions</i>

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,020
<i>for their outdoor class.</i>

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,060
<i>By the way, they look like this.</i>

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,940
<i>But Silva from Lang dorm
for some reason came to pick a fight.</i>

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,240
<i>What will you do, Mash?</i>

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:15,990
Oh?

7
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,800
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

8
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,010
<i>The difference in magic power is too big.</i>

9
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,760
<i>Shroom Head looks like
he ain't gonna be of any help.</i>

10
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,970
<i>I gotta think. Think.</i>

11
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,310
<i>How can I save that girl?</i>

12
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,810
Hey, now, was that it?

13
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,480
What a letdown.

14
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,320
What'd you say?

15
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,190
I said it's a letdown
if you don't do anything.

16
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,450
You piece of scum.

17
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,120
So now...

18
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,660
I'm willing to give you guys one chance.

19
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,540
Huh?

20
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,580
A chance?

21
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,410
Yeah, that's right.

22
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,550
Endure five hits from my magic,
and I'll leave that girl alone.

23
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,550
Of course, I'll follow the school rules
and bet one silver coin, too.

24
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,140
How about it?

25
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,100
It's not a bad deal, is it?

26
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,100
Hmm? Well?

27
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,230
Not up for it?

28
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,900
That condition is insane!

29
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,730
All right.

30
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,320
You got a deal.

31
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,610
You can't! If you do,
a serious injury won't be the end of it!

32
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,030
I'll be fine. It's only five hits.

33
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,580
What you talkin' about? It's not just you.
For that Mushroom Head over there, too.

34
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,830
He ain't got nothing to do with this!

35
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,130
Oh, yeah? You don't get to decide that.

36
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,840
All right.

37
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,670
I'll take his hits, too.

38
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,840
Can't complain about that, yeah?

39
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,640
What a riot!

40
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,770
Can you endure ten hits?

41
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,230
Spikes...

42
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,810
This is a problem I got myself into.

43
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,020
I'll get through it somehow.

44
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,160
Iron Fist.

45
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,120
<i>This might be bad.</i>

46
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,170
How's that?

47
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,590
You think you can endure ten of these?

48
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,880
Iron Fist!

49
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,800
I'm not done yet!

50
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,430
Three!

51
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,930
Four!

52
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,980
Five!

53
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,310
Six!

54
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,850
Seven!

55
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,190
Eight!

56
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,560
Nine!

57
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,540
<i>Actually, there's a certain boy
threatening me.</i>

58
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,170
<i>I don't know what I should do.</i>

59
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,050
Bet I look like an idiot.

60
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,420
Even I get it.

61
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,590
It all was too good to be true.

62
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,510
But because I'm an idiot...

63
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,770
I can't fully doubt anything.

64
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Like that girl's tears.

65
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,820
I'm surprised you endured it.

66
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:05,030
As a reward, the last one
will be an extra big one!

67
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,740
Iron Fist!

68
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,760
What a pity.

69
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,840
But did you really think
you could endure—

70
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,680
Ten hits.

71
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,220
You're done.

72
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,520
<i>This guy...</i>

73
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,900
Hey...

74
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,200
that promise...

75
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,450
I ke—

76
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,580
Hmph.

77
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,370
You idiot.

78
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,210
Idiot, idiot, idiot!

79
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,920
Just how stupid can you really be?

80
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,510
Of course you can't stay standing!

81
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,510
I got a clean hit on you with my magic!

82
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,060
Shroom Head...

83
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,180
take that girl, and run.

84
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,770
I'll somehow make everything work.

85
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,020
Iron Fist.

86
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,530
What are you blathering on about?

87
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,320
Shroom Head...

88
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,870
please, take that girl—

89
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,740
What an idiot.

90
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,080
I know you're under my charm spell,

91
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,380
but I didn't think
you'd be this desperate.

92
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,000
Come on, don't say that.

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,420
This guy is truly an idiot.

94
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,470
Basically, he's having a delusion!

95
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,800
Does he think he's
the main character or something?

96
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,010
That's so cheesy.

97
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:59,020
I hate stuffy guys like you.

98
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,270
But, well, seeing you like that
totally cracks me up.

99
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,690
Dissed by the girl
you sacrificed yourself to protect!

100
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,360
This guy is the sorriest excuse for a man!

101
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,580
Huh?

102
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,830
You guys have gone far enough.

103
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,250
Bring it on.

104
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,630
Now it's my turn
to take that ten-hit challenge.

105
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,850
Come at me, scumbag.

106
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,310
I wonder if Mash is all right.

107
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,400
Huh?

108
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,650
He's got to be all right. He's Mash.

109
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,950
That's right! He even bested
that professor during the entrance exams.

110
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,030
There are different types of magic users.

111
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,410
White Mages excel
at scholarship and support magic.

112
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,700
Red Mages excel at combat.

113
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,000
Mash has been facing White Mages so far.

114
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,250
But any Red Mage past their first year
is really tough.

115
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,550
Double-liners are not uncommon.

116
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,550
Among them,
those that equal or surpass Mash...

117
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,350
are a dime a dozen.

118
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,430
Well, well, well.

119
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,810
That's quite a statement.

120
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,770
What really pisses me off
are people like you and this guy...

121
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,650
hypocrites that are weak, but act tough.

122
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,370
Seeing guys like this,
I just wanna completely mess them up,

123
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,580
mess up that disgusting pride
and mentality.

124
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:43,660
When they realize they were tricked
and are left helpless,

125
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,080
their faces start twisting up.

126
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,340
It totally cracks me up!

127
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,170
Huh?

128
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,590
My clothes are slightly singed
thanks to him.

129
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,470
Don't make a fool of me, you scum!

130
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,320
You think you can win against me?

131
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:19,450
I earned two gold coins
during my first year!

132
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,950
My base power
is way stronger than you guys!

133
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,540
And you're in high spirits,
saying you'll kill me?

134
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,460
Go ahead and try, you lowlife!

135
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,970
Come on! Come on!
Where'd that energy go?

136
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,220
Go on and kill me!

137
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,820
Triceps Magic...

138
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,450
Ballista Knuckle.

139
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,330
Triceps Magic, huh?

140
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,990
I've never heard that before.

141
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,000
Are you serious?

142
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,460
Don't make me say it again.

143
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,090
Me and you are on...

144
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,710
differ—

145
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,510
Huh?

146
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,930
Wha?

147
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:35,360
I-I earned two coins last year
as a first-year.

148
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:42,200
My magic is top-tier
among the second-years.

149
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,620
I have the skill!

150
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,350
<i>Crap, crap, crap!</i>

151
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,020
<i>I absolutely can't win. Me?</i>

152
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,610
<i>No good. I can't stand.
I have no strength in my body.</i>

153
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,520
<i>I can't tolerate one more hit!</i>

154
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,480
<i>What the hell is this guy?</i>

155
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,880
<i>He sat down? Why?</i>

156
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,840
That makes two.

157
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,670
Huh?

158
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,180
You're going to endure ten hits, right?

159
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,050
Show me how much better you are.

160
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,100
You have eight more to go.

161
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,950
Well?

162
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,660
Think you can go for the third hit?

163
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,660
<i>Damn it, this is bad, really bad.</i>

164
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,960
<i>Any more hits ain't good. I'll die!</i>

165
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,500
<i>Something...
I have to come up with some plan.</i>

166
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:18,920
<i>Something...</i>

167
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,850
Wha...

168
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,060
<i>Its forehead stone is star-shaped.</i>

169
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:42,530
<i>Perfect! Forest scorpions worth
more than one silver coin exist!</i>

170
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,620
<i>If I can escape while the giant
forest scorpion fights Mushroom Head...</i>

171
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,370
I'm busy right now.

172
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,710
Sorry.

173
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,420
<i>You gotta be kidding me.</i>

174
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,840
<i>I earned two gold coins in my first year!</i>

175
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,180
<i>I can't let them keep mocking me.</i>

176
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,520
Why don't we call it quits?

177
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,440
I kinda feel bad for you.

178
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,660
<i>Crap, crap.
I didn't even imagine Silva losing.</i>

179
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,990
<i>What should I do?
At this rate, I'm gonna be...</i>

180
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,370
I'm sorry.

181
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,960
He made me do it.

182
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,920
I was scared and couldn't disobey.

183
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,340
I truly am sorry.

184
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,260
I'm such a terrible person, aren't I?

185
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:52,720
It's all right.

186
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:54,810
Hmph.

187
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,190
<i>Men are total suckers.</i>

188
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,690
Um...

189
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,650
I...

190
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,770
Oof!

191
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,780
...treat everyone equally.

192
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,370
<i>This guy's got some screws loose.</i>

193
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,000
Mash, are you okay?

194
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,330
You're all beat up!

195
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,920
It's nothing.

196
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,380
So you fought that second-year
named Silva after all?

197
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,720
Yeah.

198
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,220
That's amazing, Mash!

199
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,720
You even defeated a star-stone scorpion.

200
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,640
That's two silver coins!

201
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,140
That's amazing!

202
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,270
You went that far just for me.

203
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,060
Aren't you going at a good pace
since you started, Mash?

204
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,600
I'm sorry.

205
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,600
No, thank you.

206
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,860
Let's hurry over to the Nurse's Office!

207
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,690
<i>What an idiot.</i>

208
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,440
<i>That's so cheesy.</i>

209
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,660
Um...

210
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,580
you look pretty banged up.

211
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,790
Are you okay?

212
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,670
Argh!

213
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,050
Eek!

214
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,300
What's wrong with this guy? Freaky!

215
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,840
Help me!

216
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,550
Shroom Head.

217
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,020
Sorry for getting you
caught up in all that.

218
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,270
Thanks, man.

219
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,270
That's not like you.

220
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,650
Yeah? Shut your damn mouth,
or I'll kill you for real!

221
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,780
I totally felt embarrassed as I
squeezed those words out of my mouth!

222
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,450
Give me a break!

223
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,160
I'm not giving a break or anything.

224
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,990
I'll kill you!

225
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,330
You were targeted, Mash.

226
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,960
I overheard something earlier.

227
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,830
Lang is hunting for coins,
and they're mainly targeting Adler.

228
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,090
That second-year named Silva must have
picked a fight with you because of that.

229
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,720
Lang...

230
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,470
Lang dorm is made up
of the upper crust and their cronies.

231
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,100
They're so-called moralists.
They value birthright above all else.

232
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:02,230
They'll do anything they can
to prevent us nobodies

233
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,940
from getting into the Bureau of Magic.

234
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,070
Looks like it's starting.

235
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:18,330
The great war for the coins
against Lang's elite, the Magia Lupus!

236
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,750
MAGIA LUPUS

237
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,500
Magia Lupus.

238
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,670
I thought of a story idea like that
back when I was about 12.

239
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,130
HONK

240
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,510
I see.

241
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:36,890
Hmm?

242
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:45,150
One from Pierced Eyebrow
and two from the giant scorpion.

243
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,860
With five silvers,
I finally have a gold coin.

244
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,230
Whoa.

245
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,780
That light makes your face—

246
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,070
My eyes!

247
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,330
Wait, I didn't know we had separate dorms.

248
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,750
Of course we were separated.

249
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,040
You know we were sorted
right after entering, right?

250
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,750
Oh. Now that you mention it...

251
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,050
We will now sort the new students
into their dorms.

252
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,050
Touch the unicorn's horn,
and through your magic power,

253
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:21,060
it will read your thoughts and ideas
to select a dorm that suits you.

254
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,310
First up, Egalt Vansom.

255
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,810
Here.

256
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,060
Mm-hmm.

257
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,820
I sense willingness in you
and wisdom to match.

258
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,950
You are most suited for...

259
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,700
Orca dorm.

260
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,950
All right!

261
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,200
- Thank you very much!
- Next, Alben Smith.

262
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,330
Here.

263
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,790
Mm-hmm.

264
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,960
Dauntless courage and a pioneering spirit.

265
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,840
It's Adler dorm for you.

266
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,260
Hmm. You have strong magical power,
radical ideas, and a challenging nature.

267
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,220
You belong in Lang dorm.

268
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,970
<i>Heh. Centuries have passed
since I was given this role.</i>

269
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:06,770
<i>Not once have I misjudged,
as I can read people's thoughts.</i>

270
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,900
- Now, keep them coming!
- Next, Mash Burnedead.

271
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,110
'Kay.

272
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,580
Oh, I need to control my power. Sorry.

273
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,910
<i>Freaky.</i>

274
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,540
<i>Wait, he's only thinking
about cream puffs.</i>

275
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,580
<i>What's with this guy?</i>

276
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,000
<i>Isn't there anything
other than cream puffs?</i>

277
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:34,510
<i>Seriously, what are you thinking about?
What's with that face?</i>

278
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,430
<i>No, this is bad. Several centuries
into dorm selection at our academy,</i>

279
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,930
<i>not once have I
been stumped for an answer.</i>

280
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,430
<i>Okay, let's try this again.</i>

281
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,350
<i>Bliss.</i>

282
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,820
A cream puff is a confection
where batter is baked into a hollow shell

283
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,990
and custard cream is packed
into the empty space inside.

284
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,240
Especially for Choux Au Craquelin,
where gooey cream fills a brittle shell.

285
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,780
And if one were to make an analogy
with humans, it's someone

286
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,160
- harboring kindness within strength—
- It's suddenly gotten eloquent!

287
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,790
Cream puff lovers go to Adler!

288
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,790
That... was a leap of logic!

289
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,420
'Kay.

290
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,380
Oh, yeah, there was that.

291
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,380
<i>So that was...</i>

292
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,380
<i>- Mash.
- This guy.</i>

293
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,550
<i>I see.</i>

294
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,890
Ahem.

295
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,180
Lang's elite, the Magia Lupus,

296
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,930
are a group
of seven distinguished students.

297
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,940
That Pierced Eyebrow
must be one of their lackeys.

298
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,560
They've been grabbing up coins
to sway who the Divine Visionary will be.

299
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,940
Since you have a coin...

300
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,360
keep your distance from Lang,
and stick with dormmates whenever you can.

301
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,660
Okay. I will.

302
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,200
<i>But Lance's warning was in vain...</i>

303
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,920
<i>and Mash found himself lost in school.</i>

304
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,040
Where's the next class?

305
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,420
Here it is, I think.

306
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,680
Should I push or pull to open this door?

307
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,390
Hmm.

308
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,220
I always get it wrong.

309
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:11,190
Do I push or pull? Hmm...

310
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,100
I-I'm sorry!

311
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,690
I'm terribly sorry!

312
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,650
Look, you said you wanted to join us,

313
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,990
and that's why Lord Abel
gave you a chance.

314
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,160
Furthermore, you let Adler take a coin.

315
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,200
O-Once more! Please give me one more chan—

316
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,160
You misunderstand.

317
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,500
Huh?

318
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,830
I gave a chance?

319
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,840
That makes it sound
like I expected something out of him.

320
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,880
Oh, man, sorry 'bout that.

321
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,880
Humans worthy
of making this world go round...

322
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,590
must be chosen individuals.

323
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:51,600
Perfect education.
Overwhelming talent. Noble bloodline.

324
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:58,020
We're collecting coins
to create a world free of impurities.

325
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,400
But what about you?

326
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,240
You can't even become
a sacrificial pawn for our objective.

327
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,450
Pathetic wretch. You have my sympathy.

328
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:12,910
It must be hard to go on living,
knowing that you're worthless.

329
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,670
But rest assured.

330
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,630
You no longer need to think
about such things.

331
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,640
The Divine Visionary should be me.

332
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,230
Not some riffraff from Adler.

333
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,780
Right...

334
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,070
Mother?

335
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,740
A world free of impurities.

336
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,320
It will be my—

337
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,280
Um...

338
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,580
I couldn't figure out
whether to push or pull this door open.

339
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,410
Sorry.

340
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,670
Also, you know
that's a doll you're talking to?

341
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,760
Thank you
for bringing that to my attention.

342
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,980
