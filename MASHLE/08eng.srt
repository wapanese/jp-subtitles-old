1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,480
Do you...

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,690
really think you can just take a gold coin?

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,110
From me?
The magma master of Orca dorm...

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,360
Rhodes Eamus!

5
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,620
I had heard you were
surprisingly aggressive for an Orca...

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,090
But you were nothing more, it seems.

7
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,120
Magically talented, and high self-esteem...

8
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:29,620
Lang's elite, Magia Lupus,
is filled with students of that nature.

9
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,840
Its higher ranks are clearly
the top students in this school.

10
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,630
I'd rather not play defense
against those with actual skills...

11
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,680
But this school hides
the dorms' locations from each other.

12
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,270
This is to encourage
inter-dorm competition.

13
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,270
That's why...

14
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,650
we're going to figure out where
they are, so we can take their coins.

15
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,650
'Kay.

16
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,910
Were you really listening?

17
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,200
Lastly, it's been a month
since you were admitted.

18
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,000
Here's your dorm robe. Put it on.

19
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,670
'Kay.

20
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,170
You're joking around, right?

21
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,680
Whoa, the logo.

22
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,180
That's not a logo. That's Adler's mark.

23
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,430
And by the way, logos are letters
that have been transformed into a design.

24
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:29,930
'Kay.

25
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,310
I hope this makes you more conscious
of the fact that you belong to a dorm.

26
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,730
But first...

27
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,150
Mash!

28
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,440
Big trouble! Tom is...

29
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,320
- Can you hold on? My cream puffs...
- But Tom...

30
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,320
No, my cream puffs...

31
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,200
Tom!

32
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,660
<i>They went to the infirmary.</i>

33
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,290
Hey, guys...
How are you all... bambooing?

34
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,420
Or are you more like bamboo-it?

35
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,670
Captain's character identity...

36
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,720
What happened? You look so drained.

37
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,430
That's the thing. I don't really remember.

38
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,470
When I woke up, I was here.

39
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,480
Usually I live my life at full throttle
so I fall asleep and bam, it's morning.

40
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,940
I don't dream.

41
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,400
But the night I collapsed...

42
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:26,410
I dreamt that I was trapped
and stuffed in some dark box.

43
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,500
I was fully conscious but couldn't speak.

44
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,870
I was in that state for hours.

45
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,500
It was such a nightmare.

46
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,960
Captain is so shook up.

47
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,630
I need to eat a cream puff.

48
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,760
Mash, please keep it down.

49
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,260
Are you okay physically?

50
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,810
Yeah. I just feel slightly woozy.

51
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,270
Also...

52
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,810
I'm temporarily unable to use magic.

53
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,530
I hardly feel magical energy within me.

54
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,490
It's like someone sucked it out of me...

55
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,780
I see. But in any case...

56
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,450
Why are there so many here?

57
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:18,540
Yeah. They all seem to have lost
their magic temporarily, too.

58
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:23,380
Right when our headmaster
got called out to the Bureau of Magic...

59
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,930
Um, Mash. Take this.

60
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,060
HONK

61
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,060
What's this?

62
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,560
That's Creamy.
She's a good luck charm I made.

63
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,310
I've been feeling a little anxious lately.

64
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,070
What's with the ribbon?

65
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,570
You're so tactless!

66
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:51,580
In any case,
don't do anything too risky, all right?

67
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,450
Okay.

68
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,830
And keep that with you at all times,
and always think of me!

69
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,750
S-Sure.

70
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,050
You absolutely have to!

71
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,590
And when you sleep, hold onto it
so that in your dreams, I can...

72
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,760
You beast!

73
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,470
<i>Late night, after lights out in the dorm...</i>

74
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,730
I'm sure the Magia Lupus are behind
these events. What I think is—

75
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:26,400
Should we really be walking
around school after hours?

76
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,860
You really are a straight arrow, aren't you.

77
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,370
It'll be fine if we apologize later!

78
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,740
Don't leave me alone!

79
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,750
Why are you guys tagging along?

80
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:44,380
HEAVE-HO!

81
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,830
Cause I want coins too, moron!

82
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,380
Don't leave me all alone in that room!

83
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,380
I feel bad for them.
Let's take them with us.

84
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,380
- Huh? Are you really gonna do it?
- I'm so scared!

85
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,470
<i>I'm not sure about this.</i>

86
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,140
Hey! See that!?

87
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:04,020
BLOOSH

88
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,560
It's Lemon.

89
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,110
She looks so cute from behind, too.

90
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,190
Hey, Lemo...

91
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,110
Wait.

92
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,700
Something's wrong.

93
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,560
Hey, you've gotta be kidding me.

94
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:49,570
BLOOSH

95
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,560
She didn't have any eyes, but she was
so cute because it was Lemon.

96
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,070
I just realized that.

97
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,320
That's definitely magic all right.

98
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,950
- What should we—
- Wait.

99
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,660
She's going somewhere.

100
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,870
We gotta chase her.

101
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,210
She turned that corner.

102
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,750
She's gone.

103
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,380
You're kidding, right?
This is a dead end.

104
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,970
Hey. Did you hear something?

105
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,350
Huh? I didn't hear anything.

106
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,730
No, I do hear something.

107
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,480
Like the sound of wood creaking!

108
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,480
Don't be spouting random bull...

109
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,610
I heard it too. Just kill me now!

110
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,950
Lemon!

111
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,990
Stay calm. It's just a spell.

112
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,990
Disclose.

113
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,000
What the hell?

114
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,630
A d-door?

115
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,850
Revealing the door
is as far as my magic can go.

116
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,770
So we need another special spell to open it.

117
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,020
Machine Gun Explomb!

118
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,440
Damn thing won't budge!!

119
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,610
What the hell are we supposed to do with it?

120
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,080
H-Hey.

121
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,460
Mash?

122
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,280
He pried the door open
with the power of leverage.

123
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,490
Anything goes for him, huh?

124
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,290
Lemon is inside. And most likely...

125
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,620
the Magia Lupus, too.

126
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,420
<i>Don't do anything too risky, all right?</i>

127
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,220
I'm sorry, but...

128
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,720
I don't think
I'll be able to keep that promise.

129
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,600
Let's go.

130
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,310
I had no idea the school
had a lower level like this.

131
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,530
It's like a secret base. Right, Finn?

132
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,030
Y-Yeah.

133
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,530
You punk! Keep killing
the dramatic tension and I'll kill ya!

134
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:43,330
FLUMP

135
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,160
I'm sorry.

136
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,830
I mean, I wouldn't really... Wait...

137
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,290
Look, I'm sorry too, man.

138
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,330
Mash, don't be so depressed.

139
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,960
Our enemies chose this place as their hideout.

140
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,010
I'm certain this location
gives them an advantage.

141
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,010
Hey, see that?

142
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,340
There's light over there!

143
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,350
An arena?

144
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,650
What is this?

145
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,110
Are you a little slow?

146
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,610
Correct!

147
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,120
It's an ancient dueling field.

148
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,450
So old that current teachers
don't even know it exists.

149
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,910
Are you one of the Magia Lupus?

150
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,630
Me? No, no.

151
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,460
I'm here at Third Fang's request.

152
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:41,130
To eradicate intruders like you.

153
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:47,890
Now, if you want to proceed,
you need to wager coins and challenge me.

154
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,140
Though...

155
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,640
I'll never let you get through!

156
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,060
Very well.

157
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Wait.

158
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,110
Let me.

159
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,400
Dot.

160
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:04,110
'Cause you know that I hate
good-lookin' guys to death.

161
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,120
I see.

162
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,450
Go get 'im.

163
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,790
Good luck.

164
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,170
Hey, you know what?

165
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,670
You have a fan club, don't you?

166
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,800
I do. What of it?

167
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,800
Jealous rant incoming.

168
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,640
Most definitely so.

169
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,050
Very likely.

170
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,310
Livin' the dream, are ya!? I'll kill ya!

171
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,770
As expected...

172
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,230
You could say his jealousy
is even invigorating.

173
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,440
What a pitiful creature.

174
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,320
What? You're jealous of my attractiveness?

175
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,070
I am, so what!?

176
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,070
RAH

177
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,910
You can be jealous and all that.

178
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:50,410
Well, since you lack both a good face
and good brains, I don't see how I could lose.

179
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,750
Rose Whip.

180
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,840
<i>Though they came here to rescue Lemon,</i>

181
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:08,680
<i>the ugly battle of Dot Barrett, envious
of a handsome boy, was about to begin.</i>

182
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,940
<i>This is the Bureau of Magic,
the Magic Realm's highest legal authority.</i>

183
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:20,230
Mr. Wahlberg.
I apologize for the sudden call.

184
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,690
No need for apologies.

185
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,240
But the fact that you called for me means...

186
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,740
That's right.

187
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,370
Six of death row's most notorious inmates
have escaped from Hecatrice.

188
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,080
The prison guards were slaughtered.

189
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,380
And they were assisted by...

190
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,800
Innocent Zero.

191
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,680
<i>Meanwhile, in the underground arena,
Dot was jealous of the handsome guy.</i>

192
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:52,930
Eat this!

193
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,640
Explomb!

194
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,360
You guys beat Silva
the second-year, didn't you?

195
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,870
A-Actually he maybe kinda
beat the crap outta me.

196
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,380
It's a shame a guy like him
is a double-liner.

197
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,420
But magic capacity is worthless
if you don't use it right.

198
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,130
I'll say this outright.

199
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,470
I'm a lot tougher than he is.

200
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,890
Oh?

201
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,100
Well, I'm definitely not gonna lose.

202
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,270
How do you intend on winning?

203
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,230
Like this!

204
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,770
Explombomb!

205
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,620
<i>What are these?</i>

206
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,740
Marks on the ground?

207
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,620
Hey, might wanna watch your step!

208
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,210
This is a conditional spell.

209
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,420
It's got five times
the explosive power than usual!

210
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,760
There's no way I would fall
for such an obvious trap.

211
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,880
Not me.

212
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,970
Nah.

213
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:16,310
A guy like you is sure to fall for it!

214
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,730
<i>How does he intend on making me
step on these marks?</i>

215
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,480
<i>Is there a way to move me from this spot?</i>

216
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,860
I won't fall for that trick.

217
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,320
Rose Whip Absol.

218
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,000
Machine Gun Explomb!

219
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,620
Damn it, it's not working!

220
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,960
Grab.

221
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,840
My wand!

222
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,430
Stab.

223
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,760
That hurts!

224
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,350
Those thorns have completely
immobilized your body.

225
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,560
That tacky bandanna with those goofy eyes?

226
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,860
And lacking sense in magic to boot.

227
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,530
You ultimately failed in making me
step on these marks, too.

228
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,620
You really are a far cry from handsome.

229
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,370
My next attack will definitely finish you off.

230
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,790
Stop it!

231
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,620
Drop.

232
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,380
I never said anything about
making you step on the marks.

233
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:41,350
Explombomb is nothing more
than a time bomb.

234
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:49,150
Didn't think I'd confidently set time bombs
right in front of your face, did ya?

235
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,660
I'll kill ya eightfold!

236
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,450
<i>H-How can I, to someone like him...</i>

237
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,960
Don't judge everything
by their looks, pretty boy!

238
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,630
You did it, Dot!

239
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,550
There's no way I'd lose!

240
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,350
Yeah! Bring on the next guy!

241
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,610
<i>This punk. Striking an attractive pose,
even in defeat...</i>

242
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,320
<i>He sure is unwavering.</i>

243
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,950
<i>I don't exactly hate that.</i>

244
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,580
Is it over?

245
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,830
Wh-What the hell!?

246
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,330
I'm getting sucked into the ground.

247
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,580
Please, save my baby.
At least spare this one.

248
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,880
I assume this means our enemies
have no intention of letting us g...

249
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,630
I'm sinking! I'm going to sink!

250
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,970
<i>I think these guys...</i>

251
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,220
<i>are even more insane than I am?</i>

252
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,950
Their plan is to split us up
and hunt us down.

253
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,960
The double-liner first-year...

254
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,920
I was more interested
in seeing Mushroom Head.

255
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,880
<i>That magic earlier was his, huh?</i>

256
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,640
<i>So this is the upper echelon
of Magia Lupus.</i>

257
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,350
The first-year double-liner, huh?

258
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,730
Being scummy is totally inexcusable, okay?

259
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,400
I am the Third Fang
of Magia Lupus, Wirth Madl.

260
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,490
THIRD FANG: WIRTH MADL

261
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:05,450
Being worthlessly weak
is absolutely inexcusable. Got that?

262
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,840
Ow.

263
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:24,010
Two single-liners? Easy-peasy! Hurray!

264
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:27,770
I'm the Fifth Fang
of Magia Lupus, Love Cute!

265
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,890
FIFTH FANG: LOVE CUTE

266
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,520
And I'm the Fourth Fang, Milo Genius.

267
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,650
FOURTH FANG: MILO GENIUS

268
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:40,030
T-Two double-liners. We're done for.

269
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:45,450
Thank you for bringing me into this world,
Dad and Mom. I'm sorry.

270
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,830
Goodbye.

271
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,790
Hey.

272
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,000
Don't give up before we've even started.

273
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,290
It's a super underdog victory
if we can get through this.

274
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:00,090
I'll show you the power
of the protagonist, you side characters.

275
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:05,260
Wow, so cool!
You really sound like a main character!

276
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:08,890
Ouchies.

277
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,690
Huh?

278
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,480
Where is everyone?

279
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,570
Did you get separated from your friends?

280
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,530
You're from that other day...

281
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,870
It has been a while.

282
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,210
Come to think,
I had not introduced myself yet.

283
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:36,460
I am the Second Fang
of Magia Lupus, Abyss Razor.

284
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,710
SECOND FANG: ABYSS RAZOR

285
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,920
I hope you will remember me.

286
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,050
Oh. Yes, thank you.

287
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,720
How you moved about the other day...

288
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,190
It was quite impressive.

289
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,230
Oh, um, thanks.

290
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,400
I noticed it back then.

291
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,570
You're unable to use magic, aren't you?

292
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,660
Huh?

293
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,040
Th-Th-That's not necessarily t-t-true.

294
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,420
You seem a little agitated.

295
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,590
Wh-What makes you th-think that?

296
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,050
I'm not.

297
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,800
You don't have to worry.

298
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,050
Just like you,

299
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,050
I am someone abhorred by this world.

300
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,940
You must have your reasons for being here.

301
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:41,320
But I, too, have my reasons.

302
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,070
Huh? You sound like
you're planning to defeat me.

303
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,870
I'll beat the stuffing out of you.

304
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,700
With all I've got.

305
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,120
<i>In order to rescue Lemon,</i>

306
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,710
<i>Mash and company's battle against
the Magia Lupus was about to begin.</i>

307
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,980
