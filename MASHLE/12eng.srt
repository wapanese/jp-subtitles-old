1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,980
Abyss Razor.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,980
Starting now, I will give your eye
a better purpose.

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,280
Starting today, you are my tool.

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,160
Come along.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,170
Lord Abel.

6
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:02,010
<i>Around the time when Mash and the gang
were victorious over Magia Lupus...</i>

7
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,430
I wonder how Mash is doing now.

8
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,060
I hope people didn't find out he can't
use magic and make a big deal out of it.

9
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,490
I'm in trouble if he doesn't do his best
to become Divine Visionary.

10
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,740
It's part of my future planning, after all.

11
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,410
You don't need to work?

12
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,290
Time on screen is better than work.

13
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,210
Time on screen is important.

14
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,290
Yeah, it's important.

15
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,090
You want some more tea?

16
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,510
Yeah.

17
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,680
<i>Allow me to regale it again.</i>

18
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:46,430
<i>This story is where Mash Burnedead with
no magical powers enters Easton Magic Academy,</i>

19
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:51,690
Hip, hip, hooray!

20
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,230
<i>and becomes Divine Visionary...</i>

21
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,690
<i>Wait, they're still getting carried away!</i>

22
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,320
Main character! Main character!
Main character! Main character!

23
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,940
Heroine! Heroine! I am heroine!

24
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,410
You are hero?

25
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,700
Oh yeah!

26
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,580
Hip, hip, hooray!

27
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,830
Hip, hip, hooray!

28
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,830
<i>How long are they going to do that?</i>

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,710
How long are they doing that?

30
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,170
Oh, is it all right if I go to the bathroom?

31
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,090
<i>He must’ve been holding it all this time.</i>

32
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,010
Anyway, guess that's over.

33
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,520
Right.

34
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,100
All the students that were turned into puppets
are back to normal now.

35
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,400
But this school
is such a hive of lawlessness.

36
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,940
And that thrill accelerates romance.

37
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,610
What the heck?

38
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,660
By the way, where is that handsome punk?
Did he lose or something?

39
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,870
I don't think Lance would lose.

40
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,620
Huh? That was really fast...

41
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,630
Who are you?

42
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,630
Get lost.

43
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,100
Ow! What the hell d'ya...

44
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,860
What's with the wounds?
Did you lose against someone?

45
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,540
You couldn't even rise
to the top of this school.

46
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,960
You're pretty pathetic.

47
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,290
But I do appreciate you...

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,260
for giving us intel
about Headmaster Wahlberg.

49
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,220
<i>My hands are moving on their own.</i>

50
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,350
You didn't find the one
we're searching for though.

51
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:59,270
But it turns out that
we don't need you anymore.

52
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,400
We don’t need—

53
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,280
We can all party with orange juice
and cream puffs.

54
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,740
Huh?

55
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,330
<i>What's with that brat
who can't read the room?</i>

56
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,670
Huh? It kinda feels like...

57
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,340
Mash, this is bad. We're in no mood
for stuff like that right now.

58
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,630
Wait, where did you get
those cream puffs from?

59
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,150
SPLCK SPLCK SPLCK SPLCK SPLCK

60
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,240
<i>Was it coincidence!?</i>

61
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,650
<i>Was it intentional?</i>

62
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,920
Um, sorry to bother you, but we were gonna
eat those, so could you give them back?

63
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,170
<i>He's going to eat cream puffs in that state?</i>

64
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,930
Shock!

65
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,930
SHOCK

66
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,180
Insolent boy.

67
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,390
<i>What is this headache?</i>

68
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,180
<i>Is it resonance?</i>

69
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,940
<i>But I didn't have this headache
when I arrived.</i>

70
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:26,110
<i>It can't possibly be
this guy that just came in?</i>

71
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,110
<i>Really, him?</i>

72
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:33,910
<i>Huh?</i>

73
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,250
<i>Is this guy
the one we've been searching for?</i>

74
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,790
<i>What?</i>

75
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,960
Oh, fine.

76
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,340
First, to finish what I came here for.

77
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,220
Killing Abel as planned!

78
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,180
It's useless.

79
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,350
Can’t you see? You’re no match...

80
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,060
for someone like me.

81
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,900
Now die.

82
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,160
Abyss!

83
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,750
Mask Guy.

84
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,670
I-I'm sorry, Mash.

85
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:29,340
It looks like I won't be able...
to eat cream puffs with you.

86
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,020
Take this.

87
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,810
A magic handkerchief.

88
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,520
<i>My attack was not fatal?</i>

89
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:56,410
<i>That Mushroom Head threw a rock at me
right before my spell to alter the trajectory.</i>

90
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,120
<i>So this guy really is...</i>

91
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,630
Abel's lapdog, huh? How admirable.

92
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,840
Is that your gratitude for being adopted
despite being an eyesore of society?

93
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,430
That's really revolting.

94
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,600
<i>He's stomping the ground?</i>

95
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,530
He caught it.

96
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,030
Amazing!

97
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,700
Hey. You're quite the rebel.

98
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,790
I won't hesitate to kill you too!

99
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,960
Huh? Why are you licking a rock?

100
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,170
Are you in that kind of phase?

101
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:54,800
Anyway...

102
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,800
I've gotta get Mask Guy to an infirmary.

103
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,770
Try to stop me
and I'll beat the stuffing out of you.

104
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,310
Beat the stuffing outta me, huh?

105
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,100
All right.

106
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,780
How does 30 minutes sound for how long
he has before he's beyond help?

107
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,700
Will you be able to save him?

108
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,920
What's wrong?

109
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,960
I thought you were going
to beat the stuffing outta me?

110
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,590
Or are you all talk?

111
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,350
<i>He can't win.</i>

112
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,980
<i>There's too big of a gap
in the qualities they were born with.</i>

113
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,110
<i>Qualities.</i>

114
00:09:53,780 --> 00:10:01,450
<i>Mother often said to me it was only
by chance that we were born privileged.</i>

115
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,540
<i>Birthright, talent, appearance.</i>

116
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,540
<i>It was chance that bestowed
those advantages on people.</i>

117
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,420
<i>That's why...</i>

118
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,170
Don't zone out now, Abel!

119
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,220
Carborain!

120
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,890
<i>It's impossible.</i>

121
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,020
We are unquestionably inferior.

122
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,190
We cannot win against him.

123
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,940
Abyss was a fool.

124
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,610
He didn't have to make an effort
to protect me at all.

125
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,610
I think he was happy.

126
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,870
He was all alone for the longest time.

127
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,870
It was so tough for him to keep living.

128
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:56,630
And that's why I think
he was happy that you needed him.

129
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,010
I thought about how I would feel
if I was in a similar situation.

130
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,140
So...

131
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,640
I'm going to save him.

132
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,270
I think Mask Guy
wants to eat cream puffs, too.

133
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,270
<i>It was only by chance
that we were born privileged.</i>

134
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:19,610
<i>Birthright, talent, appearance.
They're mere coincidences.</i>

135
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,950
<i>That's why, Abel...</i>

136
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,450
<i>Learn to put yourself in another's position.</i>

137
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,540
<i>If you can do that...</i>

138
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,920
<i>You will become
just a little bit kinder to others.</i>

139
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:41,180
<i>Yes, just a little... kinder to others.</i>

140
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,220
Just accept it!

141
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,600
Carborain!

142
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,730
L-Lord Abel...

143
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,360
Abyss!

144
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,820
<i>It's the Eye of the Devil! Run!</i>

145
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,990
<i>Stay away from me!</i>

146
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,740
<i>I wish I didn't give birth to you!</i>

147
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:13,170
<i>I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I was ever born.</i>

148
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,050
I've heard you possess the Eye of the Devil?

149
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:23,130
I'm sorry.
I'll be careful not to make eye contact.

150
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,140
There's no need to hide it.

151
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,470
Will you use that eye for my sake?

152
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,440
I can't possibly do that.

153
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,480
Because of this eye,
everyone will avoid you as well.

154
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,030
That doesn't matter to me.

155
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:46,240
Starting now,
I will give your eye a better purpose.

156
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,410
Starting today, you are my tool.

157
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,120
Come along.

158
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,670
P-Please...

159
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,890
P-Please... run while... you can...

160
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,310
<i>Always so noble.</i>

161
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,980
<i>Mother.</i>

162
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,730
<i>And Abyss.</i>

163
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,690
Carborain!

164
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,070
Is that all you can manage?

165
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,990
You poor, pitiful, pathetic, miserable thing!

166
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,540
Hurry up, or you'll run out of time!

167
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,000
Mash.

168
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,370
<i>This is bad.</i>

169
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,510
<i>Not only are those carbon-nugget things
rock-solid, but there's too many of them.</i>

170
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:49,510
<i>Mash is slowly pushing forward,
but he doesn't have enough time to get up close.</i>

171
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:55,480
<i>But then, if I headed over to help Mash,
the two left here will be in danger.</i>

172
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,770
<i>I can't move from here.</i>

173
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,770
I'm getting bored of this.

174
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,150
Carbo Heavy Rain!

175
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,030
<i>What? A higher-ranked version!?</i>

176
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,370
<i>Oh no. It's getting even more hopeless
to make it in time.</i>

177
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,450
<i>Should I go assist him? Damn it.</i>

178
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,920
Mash!

179
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:35,100
The strong take from the weak,
and that's their right.

180
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,850
And...

181
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:43,150
The weak oppose the strong,
and that's also their right.

182
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,950
What's the meaning of this, Abel?

183
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,820
I'm seeing for myself what is righteous,

184
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,700
with my own hands.

185
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,620
Hmph. I see.

186
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,090
Carbo Heavy Rain!

187
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,100
Too bad.

188
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,140
You can't win with this kind of magic...

189
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:19,850
Hey there.

190
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,990
You're the first to break through
my rigid epidermis.

191
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,620
Even though I was caught off guard.

192
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,910
What magic did you use?

193
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,750
Huh?

194
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,420
I'm asking you what your personal magic is.

195
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,300
Huh... Um...

196
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,550
Power.

197
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,180
<i>Power!?</i>

198
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,180
<i>Such magic exists!?</i>

199
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,850
Hmph. So you're refusing to answer me.

200
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,060
Whatever.

201
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,190
That's...

202
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,350
the Spellflection Mirror!

203
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,570
A powerful magical item that reflects
any and every spell cast its way!

204
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:12,700
And the stronger the spell,
the more fearsome the mirror makes it!

205
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,950
The most feared magical item
that makes every magic user cower in terror.

206
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,540
I thought the Bureau of Magic
was guarding it. So why...

207
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,620
Mash, don't!

208
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,590
We magic users don't stand a chance
against that thing!

209
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,880
It'll send your spells right back at you!

210
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,220
One mistake and you're as good as dead!

211
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,970
<i>If you're gonna beat it,
you have to do it without using magic.</i>

212
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,850
But such a feat...

213
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,730
It's because you got in my way.

214
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,230
I'll make all of you regret it.

215
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,240
Now, use your magic.

216
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,360
You can fall to your ruin
with your own magical power...

217
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,700
if you can even do...

218
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,630
<i>It's...</i>

219
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,010
<i>It's...</i>

220
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,380
<i>It's...</i>

221
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,220
<i>It's not magic!</i>

222
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,260
<i>Then, that time...</i>

223
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,140
<i>And that time...</i>

224
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,020
<i>And that time...</i>

225
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:22,890
<i>And that time...</i>

226
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,770
<i>And that time...</i>

227
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,400
<i>This, that, and just now!</i>

228
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,320
Y-You mean nothing until now was magic?

229
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,530
Mash did everything with his body alone?

230
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,820
Seriously?

231
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,780
- That would be unbelievable.
- Totally unbelievable, right?

232
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,750
That would be like something
out of a fantasy story.

233
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,790
Like, exactly from a fantasy story.

234
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,840
That sounds like a fantasy story.

235
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,300
What? It didn't work against him at all!

236
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,560
<i>Did this appear because I touched that kid?</i>

237
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,150
<i>That headache earlier, too.</i>

238
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,190
<i>So he really is...</i>

239
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,570
I see.

240
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,780
What is that?

241
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:32,170
Today was surprisingly productive
thanks to meeting you.

242
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,760
My name is Cell War.

243
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,470
INNOCENT ZERO
CELL WAR

244
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,220
I remembered I had an urgent errand,
so I'll be going now.

245
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,980
But we'll be seeing each other again soon.

246
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,060
Bye-bye.

247
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,950
If you're going home,
I'm thankful that you're going home.

248
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,870
Now, let's take Mask Guy
to the infirmary.

249
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,620
You don't have to worry about that.

250
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,960
Thanks to the handkerchief you gave him,
it looks like things won't be too serious.

251
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:19,630
P-Please treat me...
to cream puffs next time.

252
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,510
Mask Guy.

253
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:26,350
I will take responsibility
and take Abyss back.

254
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,400
I give you my thanks,
Mash Burnedead.

255
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,070
I will make sure to return the favor.

256
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,290
I guess that settles it.

257
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,700
Yeah.

258
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:48,950
Wait, hold up!

259
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,080
Whaddaya mean,
none of that was magic!?

260
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,500
That's actually amazing,
but isn't it terrible if people found out?

261
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,800
It's terrible, Mash! Being expelled
might not be the end of it!

262
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,800
N-N-N-N-No-No-No, I-I-I-I c-c-can use m-m-m-magic-c-c-c-c-c-c-c...

263
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:10,560
TREMBLE TREMBLE TREMBLE

264
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,810
He's losing it!

265
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,180
He must have a really important reason.

266
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:15,110
Anyway, we've gotta protect Mash's secret
so people won't find out.

267
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,480
Right!

268
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,650
If Mash's record gets tarnished,
it'll affect our married life, too.

269
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:26,080
Anyway, we can shelter Mash for now,
at least until we figure out a plan.

270
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,080
Thanks, guys.

271
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,700
He just said "thanks"!

272
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,580
I wasn't expecting him
to acknowledge everything.

273
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,040
But this is turning into a hell of a mess.

274
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,840
If they find out we're protecting Mash's secret,
we'll definitely be in trouble, too.

275
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,880
We might be expelled, too.

276
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,380
No!

277
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,130
I heard everything!

278
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:49,270
A student who can't use magic in our school?
That's an outrage!

279
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,600
I'm telling the teachers!

280
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,390
We're in trouble!

281
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,190
The students who were turned into puppets...

282
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,360
They had woken up!

283
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,940
A student at a magic school can't use magic?

284
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,110
Report him! Report, report, report!

285
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:09,490
HONK

286
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,490
This time has finally come.

287
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,000
<i>He's not phased at all!</i>

288
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:17,670
<i>People have finally caught on
to Mash's inability to use magic.</i>

289
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,170
<i>What will you do, Mash!?</i>

290
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:29,010
NOM NOM NOM

291
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,640
<i>This puts a hard stop on a happy life
together with your Pops!</i>

292
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,030
Father.

293
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,620
My apologies for taking so much time.

294
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,000
But I have found it. What was lost.

295
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,540
I see. At last...

296
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,260
At last, my most earnest wish will come true.

297
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,380
Go retrieve it.

298
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:40,020
