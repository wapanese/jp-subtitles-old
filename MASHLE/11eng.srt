1
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,490
To be honest, you surprised me.

2
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,160
Abyss.

3
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:53,710
I thought Rayne was the only student
capable of facing his Evil Eye.

4
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,890
You can't possibly be a better magic user
than Rayne, a Divine Visionary.

5
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,050
But could it be that...

6
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,060
GASP

7
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,180
CLAMP

8
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,100
What's wrong, so suddenly?

9
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,520
No! It's nothing. Please, go on.

10
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,320
In any case, you seem quite capable.

11
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,820
PHEW

12
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:23,330
Which is why someone superior
like you should understand...

13
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,000
that this world does not treat
everyone equally.

14
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:34,960
I mentioned our beastly natures
to you once before.

15
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,970
I can't abide by inferior genes.

16
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,810
They're on the receiving end,
yet they take advantage of our kindness.

17
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,470
And they selfishly assert their rights.

18
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,640
Audacious, is it not?

19
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,440
We don't need to burden ourselves
with useless luggage.

20
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,610
Um, that means
people who can't use magic...

21
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,120
Yes, that's right.

22
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,740
We must dispose of them.

23
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,490
SHOCK

24
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,370
Merely segregating them
from society is too kind.

25
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,960
I will change that system.

26
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:20,220
This includes other underachievers
and people who shelter the weak.

27
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,140
Those sheltering...

28
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,260
Mash.

29
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,270
You really are a good, honest boy.

30
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,360
What? A double back somersault
at this age!?

31
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,530
Here, have my cream puff and...

32
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,410
He's eating it before I told him to!

33
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,160
Mash, I'm so proud of you, my son.

34
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,920
Okay, I understand.

35
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:03,680
Your way is kind of a problem for me.
So I don't think we can be friends.

36
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,760
I see. So you cannot understand.

37
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,600
It seems you're a little dense.

38
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,690
And inferior genes must be eradicated.

39
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,820
Phew, I sure worked hard today.

40
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,830
Huh? It's kinda broken.

41
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,920
<i>Lord Abel and Mushroom Head
are fighting each other!</i>

42
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,840
<i>Talk about bad timing!</i>

43
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,510
That doll has acid in it.

44
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,550
You should be careful.

45
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,510
Okay.

46
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,100
<i>What exactly is his plan
under these circumstances?</i>

47
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,820
<i>Huh-wha?</i>

48
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,620
<i>Huh-wha-wha?</i>

49
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,870
<i>He took them out with one throw
without touching the acidic dolls.</i>

50
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,750
STRIKE

51
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,750
<i>Like a bunch of bowling pins!</i>

52
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,470
So you mentioned something
about inferior genes earlier.

53
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:34,060
But if I beat you,
does that mean you have inferior genes?

54
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,850
You don't know when to keep quiet.

55
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,440
Also, what did you do with Lemon?

56
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,990
Lemon? I have no idea
who you're talking about.

57
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,530
All I'm doing is receiving
magical power from everyone.

58
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,410
All you're doing?
But everyone is getting sick because of it.

59
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,920
I told you.
The strong take from the weak.

60
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,290
That's our right.

61
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,170
You can't even stop them.

62
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,180
But that shows your current skill level.

63
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,430
<i>It's over!</i>

64
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,940
<i>He has grown since last we met.</i>

65
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:27,150
The strong take from the weak,
and that's their right, yes?

66
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,280
Then,

67
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,240
when I win,
you'll tell me where Lemon is.

68
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,750
I think I should move back home.

69
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,750
You're not just talk, I see.

70
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,630
Thanks.

71
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,220
And that's all I have to say about that.

72
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,110
What was that?

73
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,110
Sorry.

74
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,490
That was just too one-sided.
It lacks class.

75
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,660
Finn.

76
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,250
This is your friend, right?

77
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,800
I captured him, thinking
he'd make good entertainment.

78
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:32,050
Your spiky-haired friend
was too badly injured to be useful.

79
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,600
I'm looking forward to an interesting show.

80
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,860
Did I say you could lift a hand against him?

81
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,940
I'm sorry, but you're not allowed to attack.

82
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:54,450
If you break the rules,
I will break your friend apart.

83
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,750
I see, so that's the way you play.

84
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,590
You can break your friend apart
if you'd like.

85
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:13,010
If you don't,
you'll be the one who breaks.

86
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,140
You can't do that?
You can't choose to sacrifice?

87
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,520
Humans always want to believe
they are good.

88
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,900
But I'm saying that is a lie.

89
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,780
<i>It seems the axe broke first.</i>

90
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,910
It kind of sounds like...

91
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,080
you think you're a pretty deep person, huh?

92
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,170
<i>War is on!</i>

93
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,050
Oh, by the way,
you wanted my gold coin, right?

94
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,590
You finally feel like handing it over?

95
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,800
Yes, if you want it that badly.

96
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,480
<i>He used the coin on the threads?</i>

97
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,860
I'm sorry. I guess this coin just likes me.

98
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,870
I'm sick of you nitpicking on what I say.

99
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,660
I'm sorry I can't keep playing along with it.

100
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,790
It's useless. Human power can't resist it.

101
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,220
In the end, you are nothing more
than another puppet.

102
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,390
What I am doesn't matter.

103
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,890
I need to have you...

104
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,560
regret lashing out at my friends.

105
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,460
Marioness Change!

106
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,970
I am impressed.

107
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,720
You made me cast this spell.

108
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:30,230
But, it's still survival of the fittest.

109
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,730
The weak are but prey.

110
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:44,580
In my eyes, you are nothing more
than an unusually clever rabbit.

111
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,250
I will take your coin.

112
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,130
You were good sport for a rabbit.

113
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,340
But in the end, a rabbit is still a rabbit.

114
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,260
You cannot become a wolf...

115
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,970
What is this?

116
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,520
Oh!

117
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,770
Why is my cream puff
that I hid in my robe pocket here?

118
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,030
<i>You don't normally put a cream puff
directly into your robe pocket.</i>

119
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,700
<i>But how could he...</i>

120
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:26,040
<i>He was fully transformed into a puppet.
How did he move on his own?</i>

121
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,000
<i>My puppet magic blocks
electric signals from the brain</i>

122
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,580
<i>and wrests away
voluntary physical movement.</i>

123
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,210
<i>He shouldn't have been able to move.</i>

124
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,510
<i>Was it...</i>

125
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,090
<i>a spinal reflex?</i>

126
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,800
SPINAL REFLEX

127
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,800
<i>Spinal reflex.</i>

128
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,140
<i>It's when you pull back
after touching something hot,</i>

129
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:51,770
<i>or when your foot jolts up when the part
below your kneecap is tapped.</i>

130
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,900
<i>In order to respond quickly
to external threats,</i>

131
00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:01,070
<i>your neurotransmitters use a shortcut
that bypasses your brain.</i>

132
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,620
<i>It's true my magic only transforms
the exterior which I then puppet, but...</i>

133
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,830
<i>internally, they remain human.</i>

134
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,040
<i>A spontaneous response in puppet form</i>

135
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,710
<i>would have to be the result of a spinal reflex.</i>

136
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,840
<i>In other words...</i>

137
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,840
BAM

138
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,840
<i>An unconscious defense against a threat.</i>

139
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,470
Hanging on to that cream puff
was that important to you!?

140
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:31,480
<i>It seems hanging on to the cream puff
was that important to him.</i>

141
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:41,740
Survival of the fittest demands that
the weak fight to protect themselves as well.

142
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,490
All right. I will acknowledge that.

143
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,620
I can extract magic power from my dolls.

144
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,750
And I can use the magic power
that I extract.

145
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:58,750
I'll crush you with the ultimate spell.

146
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,140
Marioness Secondth.

147
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,350
Harm Puppet!

148
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,020
Harm Puppet turns anything
within a 100-meter radius into puppets.

149
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,770
Transformation begins
the moment the strings touch you.

150
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,690
Strings you cannot see, of course.

151
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,910
<i>That means me too?</i>

152
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,910
When the strings descend upon you,
they will rob you of bodily control.

153
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,660
There is no way to counter them.

154
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:39,840
Once you are a puppet, your body
will be toyed with until you can't recover.

155
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,170
This is my respect for you.

156
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,180
Even against a rabbit,
I must use all that I have.

157
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,060
I had too much pride.

158
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,350
And I thank you for showing me...

159
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,660
Huh?

160
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,580
Am I being appreciated?

161
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,080
How did you stop the transformation?

162
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,080
I tore the strings.

163
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,580
<i>He can't have!</i>

164
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,880
<i>It's impossible to see the strings
as they descend.</i>

165
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,300
<i>No human can stop them.</i>

166
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,180
<i>Lemme tell y'all what I saw.</i>

167
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:34,010
<i>Right after Lord Abel used his magic,
the dude turned his body in a peculiar way.</i>

168
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:38,480
<i>It must have been to delay contact
with the rest of the strings.</i>

169
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,980
<i>And most likely,
once he felt the strings on his left side...</i>

170
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,990
<i>before he lost control of his right side,
he snapped the strings!</i>

171
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:50,740
<i>A savage and way too instinctive strategy!</i>

172
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,660
<i>Impossible.</i>

173
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,740
<i>He's inhuman!</i>

174
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,660
What's wrong?

175
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,580
You're sweating, Mr. Rabbit.

176
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:08,010
You really are amusing,
Mash Burnedead!

177
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,730
<i>Ah... I'd never considered...</i>

178
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,730
Erector Spinae Magic.

179
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,360
Hell Fall!

180
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,860
<i>That yours truly could be...</i>

181
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,370
<i>the rabbit.</i>

182
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:42,080
My mother was very kind
and compassionate towards others.

183
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:49,510
Though born into nobility,
she treated commoners just as equally.

184
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:56,680
My mother said it was only by chance
that we were born privileged.

185
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,020
Then one day,
my kind mother was stabbed.

186
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:08,190
She was distributing food to the poor
as she always did.

187
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,910
A man hoarded all the food for himself,
and stabbed my mother when she resisted.

188
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,490
He said that...

189
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:22,080
getting stabbed was a comeuppance
for always having it so lucky.

190
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,670
She believed in the goodness of humanity.

191
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,420
My mother, the noble.
My mother, the na√Øf.

192
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,390
My gentle mother was gone.

193
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,560
Mother was mistaken.

194
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,900
They don't need our pity.

195
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,820
The dregs of society
are there for a reason.

196
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,240
We can't live in harmony.

197
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:58,200
I sought the best talent for my plan.

198
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:03,540
Abyss and others like him,
those who are dissatisfied with this world.

199
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,960
I dipped my hand into powers
I never should have.

200
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,880
All for my goals...

201
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,840
You won't change my mind.

202
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,890
It's only natural to pillage weak scum.

203
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,560
No, they deserve to be pillaged.

204
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,810
Bad guys are bad
no matter what their social status is.

205
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,650
The majority of those fools
are at the bottom.

206
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:31,070
That is why the bottom class
should be cut off altogether.

207
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,240
That would be a problem.

208
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,570
Yeah, a problem. Really.

209
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,990
I heard you the first time.

210
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,040
That aside...

211
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,000
Could you tell me where Lemon is?

212
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,040
Since you lost.

213
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,550
You're right.

214
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:57,760
I will release the students
who I turned into puppets. I have lost.

215
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,180
Thanks.

216
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,300
Oh.

217
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,890
But since you did this
all for your mom,

218
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,850
I guess you're not that terrible a person.

219
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,730
I'm slightly relieved by that.

220
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,820
Marioness Liberation.

221
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,120
Oh, that's right.

222
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,080
I was captured by a puppet.

223
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,630
Mash! Lemon!

224
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,380
I'm glad! You guys were all right!

225
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,880
I'm sorry to make you worry.

226
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,140
I was worried, but I'm glad.
I'm really glad.

227
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,640
Hip, hip, hooray!

228
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:55,150
They're all such fools,
aren't they, Mother?

229
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,410
Hip, hip, hooray!

230
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,910
Coin, coin, coin, coin, coin, coin.

231
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,910
Hero, hero!

232
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,910
Husband! Husband!

233
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,920
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

234
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,920
I was so scared!

235
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,920
- Thank you, Mash!
- It's cool.

236
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,800
Mash.

237
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:23,180
I'm really sorry about this.
It's my fault.

238
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,680
But really, um...

239
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,020
I really, truly thank you very much.

240
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,150
Yeah. I'm glad you're safe.

241
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,570
You cad!

242
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,700
Why?

243
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,070
Me too! I worked hard too!

244
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,740
Oh, Dot.

245
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,040
It's Dot.

246
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,080
Dot.

247
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,080
Hip, hip, hooray!

248
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,080
Truly, they're all fools.

249
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,590
Huh? By the way, where's Lance?

250
00:19:59,090 --> 00:19:59,970
Huh?

251
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,890
Stop.

252
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,600
You don't belong
at this school, do you?

253
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,230
Whatever might you be suggest...

254
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,360
<i>My magic was countered?</i>

255
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,730
Spider counter maxed!

256
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,740
However did you find me out?

257
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,990
Guilty until proven innocent
is more expedient.

258
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,040
I see. So you were fooled at first.

259
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,750
I even chose the face of a student here, too.

260
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,750
Innocent Zero.

261
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,260
A dark magic organization
working in the shadows of society.

262
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:47,010
What are sewer rats like you
doing in this school?

263
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,560
Tell me.
If you speak nonsense, I'll kill you.

264
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,230
Searching.

265
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,850
Searching?

266
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,770
Yes, it's something
very, very, very important to us.

267
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:03,280
It should be in this school right now.
How strange.

268
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,780
SLUMP

269
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,780
We had Abel searching for it,
but he couldn't find it at all.

270
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,660
He's so useless.

271
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,210
That's not an answer, punk.

272
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,290
You're so dumb.

273
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,790
Why would I tell you?
We're not even friends.

274
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:24,180
To get information out of someone,
you have to open their heart first.

275
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,100
That's just common sense.

276
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,930
Oh, no, no, no.

277
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,350
I don't have time
to be doing things like this.

278
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:37,150
I have to go kill Abel
now that we're done with him.

279
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,940
Sorry. I won't be able to deal with you.

280
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:53,500
I'll be your opponent.
The serial killer and cannibalist, Jon Pierre.

281
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,380
<i>This is bad. His power's on par
with a Divine Visionary's.</i>

282
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,090
<i>They won't stand a chance against him.</i>

283
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,970
Hip, hip, hooray!

284
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,980
