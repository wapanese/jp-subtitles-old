1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,980
<i>Finishing the outdoor class
held with Adler and Lang dorms,</i>

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,980
<i>Mash obtained a gold coin.</i>

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,360
<i>However, despite Lance's warning,
Mash got lost at school,</i>

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,490
<i>and somehow found himself
at the center of rivaling Lang dorm.</i>

5
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,160
<i>The headquarters of Magia Lupus.</i>

6
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,130
You know
that's a doll you're talking to?

7
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,550
Thank you for bringing that to my attention.

8
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,430
You're welcome.

9
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,640
So you're the first-year with the gold coin.

10
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,770
Yes, that's me.

11
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,400
Why do you wish to be a Divine Visionary?

12
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,690
To live peacefully with my family.

13
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,910
Splendid. However...

14
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,700
You are misguided.

15
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:29,000
The Divine Visionaries
are the artisans of our world.

16
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,130
They literally are the vessels of God's divinity.

17
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,920
You lack the mettle necessary
to be a creator deity.

18
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,380
Then, what about you?

19
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,680
I will return this world to its rightful form.

20
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,060
Do you know why humanity has flourished?

21
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:53,440
Because we tirelessly pillage, use,
and devour those weaker than us.

22
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,780
But look at society now.

23
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,570
Sheltering the weak, fighting for equality,
encouraging compassion...

24
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,950
It's nonsense.

25
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:11,000
Society wants to shut their eyes,
and try their hardest to avert reality.

26
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,790
We are beasts by nature.

27
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:21,800
Even in human society, the weak are pillaged,
taken advantage of, and weeded out.

28
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,350
Thus, it is we, the superior beings,
who prosper.

29
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,350
That is the law of nature.

30
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,560
I get it.

31
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,560
So you're saying...

32
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,110
you want to live peacefully as well?

33
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
What is he talking about?

34
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,580
Was he listening at all?

35
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,830
I will take those words as hostility.

36
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,960
I didn't mean it that way. I'm sorry.

37
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,920
I see.

38
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:03,840
Then I will allow you to go,
in exchange for your gold coin.

39
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,970
How about no?

40
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,100
I see.

41
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,350
Well, you have no right to refuse.

42
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,110
<i>A puppet?</i>

43
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,120
That wasn't much of a challenge.

44
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,300
What's with this puppet?

45
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,050
It's been pumping iron
a lot more than the other one.

46
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,690
I will put this coin to good use.

47
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,110
I'm sorry I said
you weren't much of a challenge.

48
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:14,580
STOMP STOMP

49
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,580
Huh? Whoops.
Almost stomped someone to death.

50
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,090
Hey, I'm going to take him
to the nurse's office.

51
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,210
You're giving up your coin?

52
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,260
No, but I'm prioritizing.

53
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,800
Besides...

54
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,850
It doesn't matter how strong you are.
I'm not gonna lose.

55
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,110
Oh?

56
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,480
Now, if you'll excuse me.

57
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,200
<i>His overwhelming confidence.</i>

58
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,120
<i>Is he simply thoughtless, or is he...</i>

59
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,460
<i>Something doesn't feel right.</i>

60
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,880
<i>My puppet is missing a button.</i>

61
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,600
<i>I think I just witnessed
something unthinkable.</i>

62
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,390
<i>When the puppet flung over the coin,</i>

63
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,310
<i>Mushroom Head ripped something
off the puppet,</i>

64
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,940
<i>sent it flying with tremendous force,</i>

65
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,570
<i>hit the coin mid-air,
and when it was floating...</i>

66
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,450
<i>he sucked the coin up
using the power of his lungs alone!</i>

67
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,160
<i>Wait, is that what I saw?</i>

68
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,460
Interesting.

69
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,920
That was close.

70
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,220
What was a person doing
lying on the floor there anyway?

71
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,850
He's unconscious.
Better get him there quickly.

72
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,690
<i>What the... I'm human again.</i>

73
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,610
<i>I can't remember anything that happened
after I was turned into a doll.</i>

74
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,610
<i>How the hell did I...</i>

75
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,240
HMPH HMPH HMPH HMPH

76
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,070
BAM BAM BAM BAM

77
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,080
Wh-What the hell are you doing!?

78
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,580
Working my exterior obliques.

79
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,460
Oh... Okay.

80
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,750
Wait, the fact that you're here
means you brought me...

81
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,590
That's right.

82
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,090
Why?

83
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,680
I was your enemy.

84
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,440
Well...

85
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,940
When one of us is in trouble,
we're all in trâ€”

86
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:43,940
BITE

87
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,400
Mhy tohnge... Nearly bit it off...

88
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,980
I-I see.

89
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,740
Okay, I'm going now.

90
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,280
Take care of yourself.

91
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,160
Huh? Sure.

92
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,540
When one of us is in trouble,
we're all in trouble, huh?

93
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,170
Damn that punk.

94
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,920
<i>Meanwhile, back at Adler dorm room 302...</i>

95
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,220
RUMBLE RUMBLE

96
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,220
RUMBLE RUMBLE

97
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,770
What do you think you're doing here?

98
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,480
And did you change your hairstyle?

99
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,190
That's my line!
I just got a new look. Call it a makeover!

100
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,610
Lemon seems to like guys
with bangs, so you know...

101
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,490
Lance, Dot, why are you two
arguing in my room?

102
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,410
<i>His face clearly scores above 70th percentile.</i>

103
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,990
<i>And being so tall...</i>

104
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,830
<i>His difficulty playing the game of life is...
Easy Mode.</i>

105
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,630
My dissatisfaction level is at 500%.

106
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,250
Now get outta this room!

107
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,630
But this is my room!

108
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,090
Just looking at ya pisses me off!

109
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,390
I hate good-lookin' guys to death!

110
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,770
I hate rude boors to death, too.

111
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,900
I can eradicate you
from this world right now, you know?

112
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,900
Bring it on. I'll triple-kill ya!

113
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,280
Um, err...

114
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,030
Very well. I will take you on.

115
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,070
Wait, no, please...

116
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,530
I beg you, if you're gonna
do anything, do it outside!

117
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,530
RAH

118
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,040
BANG

119
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,960
Right. You'll break stuff inside the room,
so can you take it outside?

120
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,000
<i>The most contradictory of contradictions.</i>

121
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,340
<i>What a great contradiction.</i>

122
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,420
Sheesh.

123
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,010
Gimme a break. Seriously.

124
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,470
Here, take this.

125
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,720
What is this?

126
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,730
What? Always have a gift when you drop by
someone else's place.

127
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,810
That's common sense.

128
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,310
<i>Despite talking and acting like a ruffian,
Dot may have a good upbringing?</i>

129
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,070
<i>And it's herb tea to boot.</i>

130
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,990
That one has a really good aroma.
It's my favorite.

131
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,070
S-Sure.

132
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,580
<i>He looks like this, but loves herb tea?</i>

133
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,160
Well...

134
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,080
All in all, today is another peaceful day.

135
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,080
NOM NOM NOM

136
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,210
Why are you so complacent?

137
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,840
We need to strategize ways to acquire coins.

138
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,090
Man, I want a girlfriend.

139
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,010
<i>Not one of them are on the same page!</i>

140
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,850
Big news!

141
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,100
<i>Four men. One of me...</i>

142
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,980
You beasts!

143
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:31,110
WRIGGLE WRIGGLE

144
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,110
We're not doing anything!
You're the one who came in here!

145
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,110
That's right!

146
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,030
Everyone, come with me!

147
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,110
What is this?

148
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,120
This Magic Scale displays
how many gold coins each dorm has.

149
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,120
Look closely.

150
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:50,750
Lang dorm has most of the gold coins for now.

151
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,500
On the other hand,
we Adler only have Mash's one coin.

152
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:01,590
Since the start of this school year, Lang has been
nabbing all the other dorms' coins.

153
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:08,770
Adler upperclassmen who could stop them
are all away for off-campus internships.

154
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,730
Lang dorm are blood-purists
with an exclusionary ideology.

155
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,780
If this keeps up, Lang will produce
this year's Divine Visionary.

156
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,240
Orca students basically
devote themselves to research.

157
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:28,410
Which means it's up to us Adlers
to put a stop to their plan.

158
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,830
<i>Lemon's going out of her way
to break the situation down for us.</i>

159
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,670
<i>She's so sweet. I'm in wuv!</i>

160
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,420
And so, please try hard, Mash!

161
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,340
'Kay.

162
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,050
I see.

163
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:47,560
This means I need to snuff out the guys
from Lang to fulfill my objective.

164
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,560
That's what this means.

165
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,810
All right, dammit! Let's kill 'em!

166
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,440
Everyone, best of luck.

167
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,240
These muscles will flex

168
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,450
in the name of peace.

169
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:17,460
<i>About your actions... I decided I must
give you reprimand, even if superficial.</i>

170
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,090
<i>Therefore, you are to clean
the owl huts for a week.</i>

171
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,010
So much for getting right into it.

172
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,600
I was a bit motivated, too.

173
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,810
I've come to help you out.

174
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,350
Huh? Why?

175
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,350
It's simple.

176
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:40,990
Lang guys might come into contact with you,
targeting your coin.

177
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,860
And I will hunt them down.

178
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,030
You're worried about me?

179
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,910
That's not it. I'll kill you.

180
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,920
Olore, did you know?

181
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,550
Once time passes, it never returns.

182
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,720
Stop stating the obvious
as if it's a profound statement.

183
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,520
It wastes time.

184
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,110
Now, shall we acquire another gold coin?

185
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,200
No one can stop the flow of time.

186
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,030
<i>Mash was cleaning up the owl huts.</i>

187
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:30,950
POKE

188
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,580
POKE

189
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:41,800
POKE POKE POKE

190
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,830
Did I do something to them?

191
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,250
It's disturbing
how much those owls hate you.

192
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,800
What in the world have I done?

193
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,920
Sea Field.

194
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,470
Mash!

195
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,720
Shuriketh.

196
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,600
Greetings, Adlers.

197
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,610
We've come for your coin.

198
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,360
You must be from Lang.

199
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,570
Yes, we are.

200
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:09,370
We are from Magia Lupus.
I'm Sixth Fang, Olore Andrew, and...

201
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,370
SIXTH FANG: OLORE ANDREW

202
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,370
Seventh Fang, Anser Shinri.

203
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,370
SEVENTH FANG: ANSER SHINRI

204
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,830
Interesting.

205
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:19,120
The one suited to become
Divine Visionary is neither of you.

206
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:23,130
So let's battle now for each other's coins.

207
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,880
* HELP ME. I'VE NEVER SWUM BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

208
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,640
I will join you soon...
Sea Shark!

209
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,810
BAM

210
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,350
The hunt's on.

211
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,600
Guess I'm left with you.

212
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,400
Let me tell you something important.

213
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,360
In a fight...

214
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,660
there is always a winner and a loser.

215
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,450
<i>Damn him.</i>

216
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:00,250
<i>He states the obvious like it was a profound
statement, and even pauses in delivery.</i>

217
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,170
<i>I wish I didn't ask.</i>

218
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,090
Shuriketh.

219
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,970
<i>His magic merely controls
that disc-shaped weapon.</i>

220
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,090
<i>My gravity magic can...</i>

221
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:13,680
Gravio...

222
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,930
<i>The owls?</i>

223
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:17,930
Shuriketh!

224
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,900
<i>Oh no. Owls have nothing to do with this.</i>

225
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,060
<i>My gravity magic will get him.</i>

226
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,270
Gravio...

227
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:29,400
<i>Big Brother!
Don't pick on those poor owls!</i>

228
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,080
You're right, my little sister.

229
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,290
Your big brother was mistaken.

230
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,960
What's wrong? This world
is about survival of the fittest.

231
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,290
Only the strong and the weak exist.

232
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,590
Shuriketh... Double!

233
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,840
<i>Oh no, the owls behind me...</i>

234
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,270
Your wand is made of magnolia.

235
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,390
You're the Crown family's kid, aren't you?

236
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:07,070
The prestigious Crown family,
famed for their gravitation magic.

237
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:12,610
I heard their eldest son ran off.
I can't believe...

238
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,870
he turned out to be so weak.

239
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,540
Did you leave due to your lack of talent?

240
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,630
I sympathize. You are one of the weak.

241
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,590
Did you know?

242
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:32,510
Overwhelming the weak
feels better than anything else.

243
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,600
Humans can evaluate themselves
only by comparing themselves with others.

244
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,520
Since there is someone below you,
you can acknowledge your own superiority.

245
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:45,520
There is a necessity for existences like you.

246
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,400
Graviole.

247
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,240
That's enough.
I will put you at ease.

248
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:06,250
<i>By defeating a Crown, I can once again
acknowledge that I am a superior being.</i>

249
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,750
Shuriketh Triple!

250
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,800
<i>Why do I feel like something is off?</i>

251
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,760
<i>All the owls are in one spot?</i>

252
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,760
Graviole.

253
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,520
The owls were in the way.

254
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,730
So I moved them over.

255
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,860
<i>Impossible.</i>

256
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:34,650
<i>With the first spell, he controlled the shovel
hanging on the hut wall to cut open the bag of feed,</i>

257
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,780
<i>and lured all the owls over.</i>

258
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:41,790
<i>He wasn't attacking me the whole time
because he was worried about the owls?</i>

259
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,710
Don't mock me!

260
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,540
Large Shuriketh!

261
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,290
This spell is my most...

262
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,210
Graviole.

263
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:05,230
<i>What? We're both the same double-liners.
What is this overwhelming difference in power?</i>

264
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,610
For you, battles are where you gain
a sense of superiority.

265
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,610
It's not the same for me.

266
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:17,110
I am forced to fight for the sake
of my dear little sister.

267
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,870
What are you trying to say?

268
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,870
Let me tell you something important.

269
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,870
Guys like you, who fight for themselves...

270
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,630
never stand a chance against
my determination to save my little sister.

271
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:41,470
You cannot escape from the Sea Field
that I have created.

272
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,930
Now, the hunt's on, Mushroom Head!

273
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,770
<i>I felt like something passed by me
at tremendous speed.</i>

274
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,270
<i>But that's ridiculous.</i>

275
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,150
<i>Humans can't swim faster
than 10km per hour.</i>

276
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,150
<i>I must have imagined it.</i>

277
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,780
<i>Although I don't see Mushroom Head
anywhere. Where could he...</i>

278
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,420
<i>Wait, back when he fell under my spell...</i>

279
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:13,500
<i>didn't he say he couldn't swim?</i>

280
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,210
"I COULD SWIM MORE THAN I THOUGHT."

281
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,800
<i>What was that?</i>

282
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,760
"I HAD THOUGHT I COULDN'T SWIM, SO THANK YOU."

283
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,800
<i>He's thanking me for something.</i>

284
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,310
<i>I-I can't see him. Not even his shadow!</i>

285
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,270
<i>So this is how it feels to be hunted...</i>

286
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,070
<i>All right. I will get serious about this.</i>

287
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,570
SeaShark Evolution!

288
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:46,330
Now that I am in this form,
nobody can stop...

289
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,430
You did it?

290
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,640
Yeah.

291
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,970
Magia Lupus.

292
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,480
If this is the power
of the sixth and seventh...

293
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,350
I think we've got this.

294
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,900
You saying it
kinda loses the dramatic tension.

295
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,280
Oh dear.

296
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,780
Such a terrible thing to say about us.

297
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,700
However...

298
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,290
Aren't you jumping to conclusions?

299
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,170
Graviole.

300
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,550
<i>I can't use my magic?</i>

301
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,390
Please calm down.

302
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,220
I'm only here for my allies.

303
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,560
You're quite menacing, though.

304
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,650
<i>What was that just now?
Did he teleport?</i>

305
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,490
<i>Is this magic?</i>

306
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,780
I apologize for seeming menacing.

307
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,870
I merely wanted a small glimpse.

308
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,670
But it is also true that I came here
to retrieve my allies.

309
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,750
You don't need to worry just yet.

310
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,460
We will meet again soon.

311
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,970
Now, good day.

312
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,640
I take it back.

313
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,520
Crushing them will be worthwhile after all.

314
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,200
In that moment...

315
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,870
Such speed, and with no magic...

316
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,500
Then he is the same type as me.

317
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:40,020
