00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,310
<i>The Easton Magic Academy.</i>

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,020
<i>A historic and prestigious school
that has produced</i>

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,980
<i>numerous pillars of the magic realm.</i>

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,570
<i>Of course, its entrance examination
is notoriously difficult.</i>

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,990
<i>Not even 3% of the applicants
will be admitted.</i>

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:22,000
<i>Only those with superior magical powers
will be able to open the gates of Easton.</i>

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,540
<i>Only those
with superior magical powers...</i>

8
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,430
<i>Let's see,
among this year's applicants are...</i>

9
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,150
<i>A scion of established nobility, and then
the undersecretary's son from the Bureau of Magic.</i>

10
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,780
<i>All the bigwigs of society, so to speak.</i>

11
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,950
<i>Maintenance of wands
and reviewing of grimoires.</i>

12
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,280
<i>They're devoting themselves to the exam.</i>

13
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,160
It's only proper to have ambitious candidates
for a school as prestigious as ours.

14
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,670
<i>What the...</i>

15
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,840
<i>Huh? What's going on?</i>

16
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,090
<i>We're starting an entrance exam
for a magic school now.</i>

17
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,180
<i>Why is someone pumping iron?</i>

18
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,600
<i>No, calm down.
Maybe I'm imagining things.</i>

19
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,060
<i>This is a magic school.
Slackers like that would never be here.</i>

20
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,810
<i>He's doing the invisible chair
while reading a fitness book!</i>

21
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,320
<i>Does he even want to pass this exam?
At least read some books about magic!</i>

22
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,820
Consumption of protein within 45 minutes
of training is the most basic of fundamentals.

23
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,530
<i>And he's talking to himself!</i>
Consumption of protein within 45 minutes
of training is the most basic of fundamentals.

24
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:03,820
<i>And he's talking to himself!</i>

25
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,910
<i>And who are those guys behind him?
They're anything but inconspicuous!</i>

26
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,290
Are you sure this will work?

27
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,670
Mash can't use magic.

28
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,960
You don't trust me and my plans?

29
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,090
I made his scar
indistinguishable from a real one.

30
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,680
I'm sure we'll get a kick outta this.

31
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,800
<i>Oh, well.</i>

32
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,100
<i>Slackers like that
will fail the exam anyway.</i>

33
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,730
I wonder what the exam is like.

34
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,140
I have to pass it, no matter
what it turns out to be.

35
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,270
Greetings!

36
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,360
Welcome to Easton Magic Academy.

37
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,370
I am overseeing today's entrance examination.
My name is Claude Lucci.

38
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,250
The pleasure's all mine.

39
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,410
C-Claude Lucci!

40
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,250
This year's seventh
best up-and-coming mage!

41
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,500
He's said to have mastered countless
advanced spells despite his youth!

42
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,760
<i>How exhilarating.</i>

43
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,390
<i>Praise and worship me even more!</i>

44
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,350
It must've been hot
coming out of the fire like that.

45
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,520
<i>I'm definitely going to flunk him!</i>

46
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,480
Now, let's start our first exam.

47
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,020
Take your seats.

48
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,150
Seats?

49
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,520
There are no seats!

50
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,230
What?

51
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,870
- Desks just appeared!
- Amazing!

52
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,250
- Wh-Whoa!
- I've never seen magic like this!

53
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,750
No wonder they have
high hopes for this professor!

54
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,920
You could've just taken us to a room
that was already set up.

55
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,250
<i>I'll kill him.</i>

56
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,590
<i>No matter.</i>

57
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,880
<i>The acceptance rate
of this exam is three percent.</i>

58
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,010
<i>There's no way
slackers like him will pass.</i>

59
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,560
You have 30 minutes!

60
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,270
Now, begin!

61
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,400
<i>The test paper...</i>

62
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,770
<i>The questions are squirming around?</i>

63
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,070
<i>That's right, I have enchanted
the test papers with my magic.</i>

64
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:12,660
<i>Thus, to pass this exam you need to dispel
the magic and properly line up the questions.</i>

65
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,290
He'll never pull this off.

66
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,420
Why'd I think
this would work the other day?

67
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,670
Could you kindly stop moving?

68
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,050
Kindly... stop moving.

69
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,310
What?

70
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:33,810
I finished.

71
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,310
<i>That guy from earlier...</i>

72
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
<i>I'm sure it's just
some random scribbles...</i>

73
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,070
<i>It's aligned so perfectly.</i>

74
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,660
He's making that boulder float so easily!

75
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,830
Whoa! He's running on water!

76
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,120
<i>From that point on, Mash...</i>

77
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,210
<i>somehow found ways
to pass the tests.</i>

78
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,340
<i>How can a slacker like that
still be here?</i>

79
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,840
<i>That tasteless brat
who makes a mockery of me...</i>

80
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,090
<i>Then I guess I must...</i>

81
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,970
This is the next test!

82
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,220
Hey, the ground again is...

83
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,610
In the next test, you will solve this maze.

84
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,990
Of course, this is no ordinary maze.

85
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,990
There are various traps set within.

86
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,620
You have 30 minutes!

87
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,000
Reach the goal by the time limit,
and you pass!

88
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,120
Now, begin!

89
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,170
So I have to get to the goal area?

90
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Sounds pretty easy.

91
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,590
Excuse me!

92
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,470
Can I tag along with you?

93
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,890
Why?

94
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,050
Huh? Um...

95
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,140
I think it'd be more efficient
if we worked together.

96
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:00,900
Makes sense.

97
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,810
Th-Thank you very much!

98
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,780
I wonder what kind of traps
will be waiting for us?

99
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,910
It hurts!

100
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,040
This maze has imps!

101
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,080
Please save me!

102
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,050
Th-This ground is trying to grab us!

103
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,380
Don't leave me behind!

104
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,680
Please wait.

105
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:43,060
Please don't leave me behind!

106
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,190
What was that about efficiency?

107
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,650
We have to hurry.

108
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,950
Levios Cuffus!

109
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,080
What are these?

110
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,120
I'm sorry I deceived you
this whole time.

111
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,330
There's a certain reason
I have to keep you away from the goal.

112
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,210
What reason?

113
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,090
I-I don't want to tell you,
that's why it's a certain reason!

114
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,430
So I've been deceived?

115
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,350
That's useless.
Human strength can't break...

116
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,850
I'm sorry...

117
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,850
but I have my own certain reason, too.

118
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:24,850
Later.

119
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,360
Th-This is bad!
I have to chase and stop him.

120
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,740
Four legs in the morning.

121
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:43,120
Two legs in the afternoon,
and three legs at night.

122
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,370
What is this creature?

123
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,130
This is totally
one of the dangerous ones.

124
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,260
<i>It's only a test.
I'll use my magic and...</i>

125
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,850
Answer my riddle.

126
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,150
<i>Oh no. My knees gave out.</i>

127
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,690
<i>Bad, really bad. This is a riddle?</i>

128
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,270
<i>What's the answer?</i>

129
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:14,650
<i>Four legs in the morning,
two at noon, three at night...</i>

130
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:19,160
<i>Oh, this sucks. I'm panicking
and I can't think straight!</i>

131
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,660
Time's up. Thou shalt be punished.

132
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,710
Help...

133
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,420
<i>That's not right.</i>

134
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,170
<i>This truly is punishment
for selfishly deceiving others.</i>

135
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,640
<i>I'm so terrible.</i>

136
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,350
<i>I'm sorry, Mushroom Head.</i>

137
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,810
Such a creature...

138
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,940
can't possibly exist.

139
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,570
Wh-Why did you bother
to come back and save me?

140
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,820
Well...

141
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,750
If your reason was similar to mine,
I'd kinda feel sorry for you.

142
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,500
But it looks like
we won't make it in time from here.

143
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,590
How do you think
I came here in an instant?

144
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
<i>Time is almost up.</i>

145
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,980
<i>Multiple traps
and the guardian of the labyrinth...</i>

146
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,810
<i>And the student I recruited to stop him.</i>

147
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,770
<i>Since I put in this much effort,
I'm sure he...</i>

148
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,650
Hey, what's with that loud noise?

149
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,360
Sounds like something is breaking!

150
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,610
<i>Th-There's no way.</i>

151
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,240
<i>These walls are one meter thick
and are impervious to all magic.</i>

152
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,000
<i>The walls!</i>

153
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,510
H-He trudged straight outta there!

154
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,470
Quite a curious young man.

155
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,520
Is that allowed?
Can he really do that?

156
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,900
There's no way he can!

157
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,150
That's cheating!

158
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,020
Gimme a break!

159
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:21,160
Go home! Go home! Go home!

160
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,910
I want to go home.

161
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,120
That's absurd.
It's no longer a labyrinth!

162
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,290
Indeed.

163
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,620
You're supposed to get lost
in a maze before exiting!

164
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,540
Good point.

165
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,130
What is a maze for you?

166
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,170
Philosophy.

167
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,880
Go home! Go home! Go home!

168
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,300
P-Please stop! It wasn't his fault!

169
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,550
Stop it!

170
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,930
If you say anything, you'll regret it!

171
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,560
I can still reconsider that promise for now.

172
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,440
- I was...
- Hey!

173
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:55,520
I was intentionally getting in his way
so he wouldn't reach the goal.

174
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,820
Professor Lucci asked me to.

175
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,450
He told me he would pass me
if I got in his way.

176
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:08,330
My family is poor, and I desperately
wanted to be accepted for their sake.

177
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,080
But he still saved me,
and then said to me,

178
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,750
"Please marry me"!

179
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,210
No, I didn't say that.

180
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,840
I mean...

181
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,340
If you're injured, I can piggyback you.

182
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,260
Huh? Wait, that means...

183
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,760
I'm a burden, you know?

184
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,720
I don't really mind burdens at all.

185
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,850
Don't be so bashful.

186
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,400
I know how you really feel.

187
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,240
It was really great. Yeah.

188
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,860
No, I totally didn't say that.

189
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,700
That's right. What about it?

190
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,740
I'm the examiner.

191
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,870
What's bad about trying
to fail students I don't like?

192
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,880
A cheeky brat and a pauper girl.

193
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:02,510
I reached out thinking even scum can be
useful, but you bit the hand that fed you.

194
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,340
Is your stupidity
inherited from your parents?

195
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,760
No wonder you have a miserable life.

196
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,060
I'm failing you both.

197
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,860
If you want to complain,
then challenge the decision.

198
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,400
Challenge me,
a Magus Cum Laude Professor!

199
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,570
Of course, that's only if you dare!

200
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,330
That's going too far, Professor.

201
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,080
What?

202
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,370
Wow. He broke that wand.

203
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,340
That's just the type of kid he is, huh?

204
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,090
I kinda feel sorry for him.

205
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,800
Shut up! Why would I evenâ€”

206
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,090
Silence!

207
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,350
Headmaster Wahlberg.

208
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,600
We will now begin the final interviews.

209
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,980
From this point on,
I will take charge of the examination.

210
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,860
Headmaster, why are you here?

211
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,360
Lucci.

212
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,360
See me in my office after this.

213
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,410
A-As you wish.

214
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,620
Now, let's start with our first applicant.

215
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:24,630
We will now begin the final interview
for Mash Burnedead.

216
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,510
Thank you for having me.

217
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,390
First, let's hear
why you chose our academy.

218
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,650
To live in peace with my family.

219
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,480
That's not an answer.

220
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,860
What does that mean?

221
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,650
It's fine.

222
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,530
Next question.

223
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:55,410
Is it true that you saved a girl in the maze test,
although you didn't have time to?

224
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,660
I guess so.

225
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:03,040
What made you do so,
even by risking to fail the test?

226
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,960
I kinda felt like I would regret it.

227
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:13,510
You seem to be the type
who acts before thinking.

228
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,850
You never considered
that the sphinx might be stronger,

229
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:21,810
or that you may not be able
to break the walls?

230
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,480
Well, even if I considered,
it still had to be done.

231
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,200
Extremely amusing.

232
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:36,740
But you can only say that because
you don't understand the ways of the world yet.

233
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,580
Many creatures that are stronger
than you exist in this world.

234
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,750
If you were to face something
that overwhelmingly outpowers you,

235
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,880
would you still be able
to take the same course of action?

236
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,340
Even if you were...

237
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,850
facing me?

238
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,730
<i>What immense magical power.</i>

239
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,230
<i>And this spell!</i>

240
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,370
What is this?

241
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:23,620
This is an ancient spell that transfers the soul
of the target's most cherished one into a doll.

242
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,750
Gramps?

243
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,250
What's wrong? Gramps! Hey!

244
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,380
Of course, that's not all.

245
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,890
If I were to stab a knife
into the soulful doll...

246
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,760
that being would never return.

247
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,270
Didn't I already tell you?

248
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,650
I am immensely more powerful than you.

249
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:54,450
You can't do anything in your current state.

250
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:59,160
And in a situation like this,
what would you...

251
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:10,300
You can't keep something
this huge out forever.

252
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,050
This is an endurance contest, right?

253
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:24,060
Power can be used to harm or to help.

254
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:28,230
It all depends
on the wielder of that power.

255
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,440
That is the reason why I put emphasis...

256
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,450
on protecting the weak,
and regulating the strong.

257
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:42,540
Noblesse Oblige.
One's capacity as a powerful being.

258
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:51,250
And according to my observations,
you are a human who possesses that capacity.

259
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,180
My apologies.

260
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,520
I was literally testing you.

261
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,850
I had no intention of that nature.

262
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,940
Don't worry about it.

263
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,730
What is it?

264
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,070
What you asked earlier, Headmaster.

265
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:20,030
The answer to the question
"If I had to face the Headmaster..."

266
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,910
If it comes to that,
I'd knock the stuffing out of you...

267
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,000
with my fist.

268
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,790
What insolence!

269
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,380
Are you insane?

270
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:37,420
Welcome to Easton Magic Academy.

271
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,010
Are you okay, old man?

272
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,100
Be gentle with me.

273
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,640
<i>And so, a lot of things happened.</i>

274
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:51,650
<i>But Mash Burnedead passed the entrance exam
for Easton Magic Academy.</i>

275
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,650
Today, we will be learning one of the most
basic of spells, the lock-opening spell.

276
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,490
You must imagine opening the lock
as you infuse it with magic energy.

277
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,660
Opti Ars.

278
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,660
Now, let's actually try it.

279
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,210
Professor. I opened it.

280
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:19,550
Why you little, that's not...
That's not it at all, damn it!

281
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,390
This is a magic school, you know?

282
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,850
A place where you learn magic!

283
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,430
Well, I...

284
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,770
I'm not good with magic and the like.

285
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,440
Why are you even here?

286
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,150
Looks like I have a hard path ahead.

287
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,360
Why are you sounding like
it's not your business?

288
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,570
What kind of nerves do you have?

289
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,650
<i>What's with this year's transfers?</i>

290
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,570
<i>There's someone who's clearly bad news!</i>

291
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,120
God is dead.

292
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,870
Where the hell did that come from?
Seriously creepy!

293
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,200
<i>I definitely don't want to be around him.</i>
Where the hell did that come from?
Seriously creepy!

294
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,960
Where are you looking at now?

295
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,960
Listen! Listen to what others have to say!

296
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,510
<i>Since this is a boarding school...</i>

297
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,260
<i>I really don't want to be roommates
with people like that.</i>

298
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,260
Let's see, my room...

299
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,220
Huh, wait...

300
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,770
The door...

301
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,820
I'm Finn Ames.
Nice to be rooming with you.

302
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,570
I'm Mash Burnedead.

303
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:27,540
I don't really know a lot, so I might
cause trouble, but it's nice to room with you.

304
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,870
<i>Huh? He's surprisingly normal?</i>

305
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,370
And this is Kevin.

306
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,920
This one's Mike.

307
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:40,550
<i>This guy names his muscles! Freaky!
And when did he change clothes?</i>

308
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:45,590
W-Well, you can ask me
anything you don't know.

309
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:50,180
The dorm pairs up transfers and continuing
students together as roommates.

310
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,690
It's customary to help each other out.

311
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,690
I see.

312
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,310
<i>Be nice for now.</i>

313
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,860
<i>Nice, and distant.</i>

314
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,860
<i>This is for a peaceful school life.</i>

315
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,490
Can I ask you one thing?

316
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,200
Sure.

317
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,780
How do you get to be
the academy's "Divine Visionary"?

318
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,700
Oh, a Divine Visionary?

319
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,120
You have to collect gold coins.

320
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,790
Tests, coursework, extracurriculars, school life.
We're evaluated on everything.

321
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:23,090
Based on the evaluations, you're given
coins of gold, silver, or bronze.

322
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,930
Regardless of coins earned,

323
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:30,350
if you can't keep your grades up
each semester, you'll be expelled.

324
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:35,020
I had a vague feeling,
but this is really brutal.

325
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,350
<i>Looks like he'll be expelled real quick.</i>

326
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,940
So that's why we're all desperate.

327
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,360
Including me, of course.

328
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,240
Best of luck to you, too.

329
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,360
<i>Finn made sure not to say,
"Let's do our best together."</i>

330
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,620
You're a great guy.

331
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,330
<i>And Mash was very simple.</i>

332
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,080
You want a cream puff?

333
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,830
Huh? Where did you pull those out of?

334
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,250
I'll take one, though.

335
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:03,880
<i>Will Mash with no magical powers
really be able to become the Divine Visionary?</i>
