1
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:10,083
From previous experiments,

2
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:14,042
we've established that our
D-mails are being sent back in time.

3
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:17,833
But we couldn't change how
I fared against Faris-<i>tan </i>in our game.

4
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:20,375
I'd say that's <i>your </i>problem.

5
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:23,958
I guess there<i> is </i>an issue with
accuracy, given Ruka's case too,

6
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,917
--but a few improvements and we'll have a real time machine--

7
00:00:25,917 --> 00:00:27,833
--Time machine?
--but a few improvements and we'll have a real time machine--

8
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:29,917
You eavesdropped?!

9
00:00:29,917 --> 00:00:33,708
Faris only brought your order, meow!

10
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,583
--Would you like some sugar syrup or milk, meow?

11
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:36,500
--No!
--Would you like some sugar syrup or milk, meow?

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,875
Then I'll give you<i> all </i>of it, Kyouma.

13
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:41,708
--Meow, meow!
--There it is!

14
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,000
Special Technique: Eye Contact Stir!

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,083
--I'm jealous, Okarin! Go die in a fire!
--Kyouma!

16
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,333
--I'm jealous, Okarin! Go die in a fire!
--What's this about a time machine, meow?

17
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:52,833
Do you really think such attempts
at seduction will get me to talk?

18
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:54,792
I see you're im-purr-vious to it, Kyouma.

19
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:56,458
Daru!

20
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:59,125
--Daru would never betray--
--We made a machine to send e-mails to the past!

21
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,917
--I did most of the work!
--Have you no shame at all?!

22
00:01:01,917 --> 00:01:04,750
E-mails to the past...?

23
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:25,000
<i>For you, billions and billions of heartbeats</i>

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,667
<i>are nothing at all; just the blink of an eye</i>

25
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:36,875
<i>Although I'm trapped by</i>
<i>the past and lament the future</i>

26
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:42,792
<i>inevitability won't allow for</i>
<i>even a speck of a miscalculation</i>

27
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:48,917
<i>Our dreams and futures that</i>
<i>form and expand into "infinity"</i>

28
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:54,792
<i>allow us the right to be vain,</i>

29
00:01:54,792 --> 00:02:01,000
<i>while the two hands</i>
<i>point out what is "finite"</i>

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,583
<i>All of which leads to a cruel</i>
<i>contract and choice to make</i>

31
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,833
<i>Hacking to the Gate</i>

32
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:14,750
<i>So, now, with each passing</i>
<i>second, I'll cross world lines</i>

33
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,667
<i>to protect that smile on your face</i>

34
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:26,667
<i>Then, once again, into a</i>
<i>time loop without sadness</i>

35
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:33,375
<i>I will be swallowed up as a lone observer</i>

36
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,667
--Damn Daru, leaking confidential information to an outsider...

37
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:43,250
--Why?
--Damn Daru, leaking confidential information to an outsider...

38
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,708
Why do you see it that way? I just--!

39
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,792
No! It isn't like that at all!

40
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:50,375
I'm...!

41
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,583
Wh-Wh-What?

42
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,375
I <i>wasn't </i>crying.

43
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,958
I <i>wasn't </i>crying, just so you know!

44
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,417
It sure seemed like you were to me...

45
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:23,750
Your eyes are still red.

46
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,458
I-It's not what you think!

47
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:29,458
--There's just something in my eye...
--Are you out of an old drama or something?

48
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,125
I <i>wasn't </i>crying, okay?!

49
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,792
So don't pester me about it! Got it?!

50
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:36,458
Actually, I haven't said a word about it.

51
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,583
Sh-Shut up!

52
00:03:57,792 --> 00:04:00,542
--Christina--
--Shut up! Don't talk to me!

53
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:09,417
I'll just say this: I cherish you as a friend.

54
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:11,417
You can talk to me anytime.

55
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:14,500
Okabe...

56
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,458
Precisely as planned!
She fell right into my trap!

57
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:22,708
Yes! Now she's wrapped
around my little finger!

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,292
Hey, now...

59
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,792
Good work today, meow!

60
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:31,500
Oh, Faris-<i>chan</i>!

61
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,333
Are you going to see Kyouma now?

62
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,667
Yeah. He asked me to
pick up something for lunch.

63
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:41,833
Say, have you seen the
time machine, Mayushii?

64
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,083
Time...?

65
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,458
Oh, Phone Microwave<i>-san</i>?

66
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,833
Phone Microwave?

67
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,083
It makes this lightning
that's all, "Crackle! Zap!"

68
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:53,500
It's all tingly and kinda scary...

69
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:57,917
Wow! That sounds like a time
machine straight out of the movies!

70
00:04:57,917 --> 00:04:59,833
Yeah.

71
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:04,833
But Mayushii wishes they
wouldn't do stuff with it...

72
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,042
Why not?

73
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:12,708
It feels kind of like Okarin is
getting further and further away...

74
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,542
This round table
meeting will now come to--

75
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:18,500
Okarin, Okarin!

76
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,417
--What?
--Isn't it strange?

77
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:23,042
Mayushii said she isn't cosplaying, but...

78
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:25,958
She isn't. That's her school uniform.

79
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,917
I had school today.

80
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:31,750
An ultra-realistic portrayal
of a school uniform...

81
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,333
You know, talking like that is
usually considered sexual harassment.

82
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,208
Here's yours, Okarin!

83
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,125
Thanks.

84
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:40,167
Get it right! This is a round table <i>meeting</i>!

85
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:43,042
You're the one who asked me
to pick up something for lunch.

86
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,500
Don't worry about it.

87
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,542
I doubt he has anything
important to say anyway.

88
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:49,583
Perhaps you'll change your tune when
you hear today's topic of discussion!

89
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,583
By which I mean... physical time travel!

90
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:57,458
Mayuri. Is there any
barley tea left in the fridge?

91
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,292
Just a sec!

92
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,333
Ultra-realistic...

93
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:03,333
It's me!

94
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,792
The Organization has begun to
bring the lab down from the inside!

95
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:11,083
My fellow lab members no
longer pay heed to my words!

96
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,750
It's always been that way.

97
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,083
Then how can you just brush
aside this great topic of discussion?!

98
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,042
Because it's obviously impossible.

99
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:20,333
We've sent e-mails back in time!

100
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,333
--Who says we can't--
--We can't.

101
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,125
We can only send a little over 36 bytes.

102
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:28,917
Three messages six Japanese
characters-long. Any more is impossible.

103
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:32,833
But if you'd like to try, why
not experiment on yourself?

104
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:36,042
If you don't mind turning
into a Gel-Okarin, of course.

105
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:37,792
Oh, a Gel-Okarin?

106
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:39,542
Ooh, burn!

107
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:44,542
SERN's experiments have proven
the difficulty of physical time travel.

108
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:49,042
If the LHC, the world's largest
particle collider couldn't do it,

109
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,958
there's no way <i>this </i>equipment can.

110
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,500
Then how were we
able to send the e-mails?!

111
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,333
I don't know. That's the real question.

112
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,958
As we discussed before, SERN
is attempting to achieve time travel

113
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,625
through the use of a black hole and a lifter.

114
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:06,125
This Phone Microwave most
likely works in the same way.

115
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:10,333
Yet, whatever functions as
<i>our </i>lifter isn't in the microwave.

116
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,333
Where is it, then?

117
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,917
I don't know.

118
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:16,125
Plus we're only able to send
D-mails at certain times of the day.

119
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:21,083
For a machine that sends e-mails
back in time, it's still very shoddy.

120
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:25,000
We need to solve these mysteries
before we move any further ahead.

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,375
That's no fun!

122
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:30,667
99% of science is unexciting humdrum.

123
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:32,792
If you profess to be a scientist, then--

124
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:36,375
I told you, I am not a scientist!
I'm a "mad scientist"!

125
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:40,250
This guy's hopeless. Better do
something about him quick...

126
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,000
Miss Makise?

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,958
Don't tell me you're quoting...

128
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:48,208
Shut up! Don't say
any more! It's not like that!

129
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,083
Just get to the point!

130
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,625
All right, then. Status updates.

131
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:57,833
How is the translation of the data on
SERN's server coming along, Christina?

132
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:01,417
--Or shall I say... @channeler!
--I told you, it's not like that!

133
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:04,833
--Yet your ID is bright red.
--Is not!

134
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,000
Th-There's nothing of note to report.

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I see. Continue to investigate...

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,542
--...@channeler!
--Don't call me that!

137
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:17,083
You're next, Daru.
How's the hacking coming along?

138
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,000
No change.

139
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,125
Pretty much at a
standstill until we can analyze

140
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,125
the mystery program on the other server.

141
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,125
Can't the IBN 5100 handle that?

142
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,292
Easier said than done, dude.

143
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:29,750
What do you mean?

144
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,000
What do <i>you </i>mean?

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,417
You haven't deciphered it yet?

146
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:35,875
Huh? How would I do that?

147
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:41,167
--The IBN 5100! Where is it?!
--How should I know?!

148
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,250
It can't be...!

149
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,958
What's gotten into you, Okarin?

150
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,167
Christina...

151
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:59,542
Have I not found the IBN 5100...?

152
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:03,833
Huh? We don't even know
where to find one in the first place.

153
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,375
I see.

154
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:14,500
So, I'm to believe you
actually found an IBN 5100?

155
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,083
Yes. The two of us carried it here.

156
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:22,042
But you're the only
one with any memory of it.

157
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:26,042
The D-mails must've greatly altered the past.

158
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:27,667
Greatly?

159
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:32,250
But we've only sent simple messages!

160
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,792
It's the "Butterfly Effect."

161
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:37,792
Sending a message back in
time causes the world line to split.

162
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:43,125
From a world where we didn't buy a
Loto 6 ticket to one where we did, for example.

163
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:48,208
As a result, events and facts that
happened before change ever so slightly.

164
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:51,833
Like billiards, a single change
can trigger further changes,

165
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,833
resulting in even greater changes.

166
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:58,750
It's one of the most famous
risks of altering the past.

167
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,875
Then where<i> is </i>the IBN 5100?

168
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:05,750
Let me turn the tables: Where did <i>you </i>find it?

169
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,833
Yes.

170
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:13,083
Yes, my father said it <i>was </i>stored at the shrine,

171
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,792
but now it's nowhere to be found...

172
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:17,417
Oh...

173
00:10:18,292 --> 00:10:20,167
Well?

174
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:25,250
There <i>was </i>an IBN 5100
at the Yanabayashi Shrine...

175
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,875
...but not anymore.

176
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,500
They're not sure who took it, or even when.

177
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,667
A dead-end...

178
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:36,750
Storing a computer at a
shrine sure sounds strange!

179
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,292
I wonder who did it...

180
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,333
--Faris-<i>chan</i>!
--Meow?

181
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:53,875
Here are the ten questions I came up
with for the maids at the next event...

182
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,292
Let's see here!

183
00:10:56,292 --> 00:11:01,042
"If you could go back in time and
redo one thing, what would it be?"

184
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:03,625
What would you do, Faris-<i>chan</i>?

185
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:08,000
Good question! Faris...

186
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,875
...doesn't focus on the past!

187
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:13,042
As cat-girl maids who
bring happiness to everyone,

188
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:15,917
it's our duty to always move forward!

189
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,875
Oh! Phone, phone!

190
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,000
Hi! This is Faris, meow!

191
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Kyouma?

192
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,167
Meow? A computer?

193
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:27,083
An IBN 5100.

194
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:30,167
Is it true that you stored
one at the Yanabayashi Shrine?

195
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:33,583
I don't really remember,

196
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:37,750
but Daddy did have lots
of old computers, meow.

197
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,792
Kyouma...

198
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:47,542
Does this have something to do
with this time machine of yours?

199
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,875
Wow, look!

200
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,833
An Oopa! A Metal Oopa!

201
00:11:57,292 --> 00:11:59,667
Oh, you still want a Metal Oopa?

202
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:01,292
"Still"?

203
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,833
How long are we gonna
stand here? Let's get going.

204
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,292
Oh, wait!

205
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:10,917
Daru-<i>kun</i>!

206
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:13,292
Sorry for the wait!

207
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:17,833
What are you shopping for?!

208
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:21,125
Couldn't help it! I spotted
some limited edition swag!

209
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,750
As you'd say,

210
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,125
"This fateful encounter was
truly the choice of Steins Gate!"

211
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,792
Don't use that term lightly!

212
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:30,708
Why are you two tagging along anyway?!

213
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,250
You should just hold down
the fort with my assistant.

214
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,333
STFU! I can't turn down an
opportunity to visit Faris-<i>tan </i>at home!

215
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,292
Mayushii wants to visit her too!

216
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,792
Why the heck did she invite me over anyway?

217
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:44,792
Oh, it's Kirari-<i>chan</i>!

218
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:46,917
Hey! Mayuri!

219
00:12:46,917 --> 00:12:48,708
Sheesh...

220
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,208
The IBN 5100...

221
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,792
Shining Finger!

222
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:06,792
Hey! Wait!

223
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,833
Shining--!

224
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,667
Moeka! Kiryu Moeka!

225
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,125
Why...?

226
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:38,208
FB said it would be there...

227
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,667
Okabe-<i>kun</i>...?

228
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:45,042
You mentioned the IBN 5100 just now--

229
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:48,375
Do you know where it is?!

230
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,667
You don't know either?

231
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,292
You don't know...?

232
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,417
Okarin!

233
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:07,500
Oh, Moeka-<i>san</i>?

234
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,458
Yeah...

235
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,875
Okarin!

236
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:13,208
Moeka-<i>san </i>is so pretty and stylish!

237
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:16,042
I bet she'd look amazing if she cosplayed!

238
00:14:16,042 --> 00:14:18,542
Yeah...

239
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:22,667
Hold on, Mayuri.
You know who Shining Finger is?

240
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:24,875
Huh? Yeah.

241
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,708
How?! How is that possible?!

242
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:31,583
You brought her to the lab...!

243
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,125
After Moeka sent her D-mail,

244
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,833
her existence was
erased from their memories.

245
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:45,292
And now, after Ruka's D-mail,
everyone knows who Moeka is again...

246
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:50,500
Each time a D-mail alters the past,
things start to change little by little?

247
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,208
You're <i>sure </i>this is the place?

248
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm sure!

249
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,625
Let's see... It looks
like she's on the top floor.

250
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:22,667
The young mistress will be here shortly.

251
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:24,625
Please wait here.

252
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,000
Butler cafes aren't really my thing, you know...

253
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
A real-life butler! I've never seen one before!

254
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:40,458
Look! The people are like garbage!

255
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,958
What a magnificent view!

256
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,208
Okarin...

257
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,875
I knew he'd say that.

258
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,333
Sorry for the wait, meow!

259
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,000
Oh, Faris-<i>chan</i>!

260
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,583
Now I get to witness Faris-<i>tan </i>in plain clothes!

261
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,083
What good fortune!

262
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,542
--Faris Meow-Meow!
--Meow?

263
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:02,917
It would seem prudent to
ask who you <i>really </i>are now.

264
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:05,042
Faris is...

265
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,250
...Faris, meow!

266
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,917
Don't toy with me!

267
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:11,458
If you won't explain, then I'm leaving!

268
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,958
Fine, meow...

269
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:18,125
Faris' family originally owned...

270
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,125
...all the land around here!

271
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,792
Wait, does that mean Akiba is...?

272
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:24,250
Yep! That's right!

273
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,250
Huh? What about Akiba now?

274
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:30,167
It's part of her real name: Akiha Rumiho-<i>chan</i>!

275
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:32,042
La-la-la-la! I can't hear you!

276
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:34,583
Faris-<i>tan</i>'s real name is Faris-<i>tan</i>!

277
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,083
An embarrassing attempt at escaping reality...

278
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,500
Incidentally, Faris was the one who asked

279
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,458
for <i>moe </i>culture to be
introduced into Akiba, meow!

280
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,708
Wha...?! You're <i>that </i>influential?!

281
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,083
And, being the angel
you are, you use May Queen

282
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,958
to personally spread <i>moe</i>
culture throughout the land!

283
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,375
She's so l33t!

284
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:54,083
And I have l33t eyes for
recognizing someone so l33t!

285
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:58,583
But please don't tell
anyone else about this, meow.

286
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,958
I want everyone to treat me with
the same "Faris love" as always!

287
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,000
I will! With every ounce of my being!

288
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,375
Thanks, meow, meow!

289
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:09,167
Never mind the meows!
We're here about the IBN 5100!

290
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:11,583
Oh, that, meow?

291
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:16,250
But before that, I have a small request...

292
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,458
Are you trying to extort us?!

293
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,500
I promise, it's nothing much!

294
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,542
I just want to use the
D-mail one time, that's all!

295
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:27,375
But of course! You can
send as many as you'd like!

296
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,625
Hold on! No one outside the
lab is allowed to know about--

297
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:34,417
Then can't we just make
Faris-<i>chan </i>a lab member too?

298
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:36,542
No, wait! Hold on!

299
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:39,000
It's too dangerous to send any more--

300
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,042
So you get to send messages about
the Loto 6 for your own personal greed,

301
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:44,708
but Faris-<i>tan </i>doesn't?!

302
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,042
It's just one time!

303
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:48,708
No, that's not what it's about...

304
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:55,542
Still, there's no guarantee
we'll find the IBN 5100 on our own.

305
00:17:55,542 --> 00:18:00,667
If she can help us track it down...

306
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:01,542
All right.

307
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:05,625
But you will have to become a
lab member, just as Mayuri said.

308
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:09,292
As of today, you are
Lab Member 007: Akiha Rumi--

309
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:12,083
La-la-la-la! I-I can't hear you!

310
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:16,583
Done!

311
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,417
You're sure you want
this sent ten years back?

312
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:21,208
I'm sure, meow!

313
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,333
What's it say?

314
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,500
It's... a secret, meow.

315
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,583
That won't do!

316
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:31,250
As the head of the lab,
I need to know this sort of--!

317
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,042
Too bad.

318
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:35,375
Boys aren't allowed to
meddle in girls' private lives!

319
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:38,083
I think it's wrong to
read other people's e-mail.

320
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,125
I totally agree!

321
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,792
Oh, all right...

322
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:46,958
Okay, wait with your
finger on the send button.

323
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:52,542
Hello?

324
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:56,375
It's me. Give me a status report--

325
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,042
--She hung up on me!
--I don't blame her.

326
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:04,167
Lousy Christina!
You're supposed to be my assistant!

327
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:04,667
Hello?

328
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:07,250
It's Hououin Kyouma. Don't hang up on me.

329
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,625
Hououin?

330
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,833
Oh, it's you, Okabe.
I thought it was a prank caller.

331
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,542
You clearly saw it was me calling.

332
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:18,500
Still, you were so creepy-sounding
that I couldn't help it.

333
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:24,167
In other words, you fear the great Hououin--

334
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:27,958
She did it again! She hung up again!

335
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,458
What's taking so long, Okarin?

336
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,333
Hold on!

337
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,333
Curse that cold-hearted,
prodigal, perverted genius girl!

338
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:37,208
--Hello?
--Now you listen here, The Zomb--!

339
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,250
Hello?

340
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,125
My name is Okabe Rintaro...

341
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,375
How can I help you?

342
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:52,667
I humbly asketh you to activate the
Phone Microwave (Temporary Name)

343
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:56,583
as per the settings
provided in my prior e-mail.

344
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,167
You should've said so at the start.

345
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:03,542
You used "asketh" wrong, by the way.
You're an embarrassment to yourself.

346
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:06,375
Also, it's about time you
drop the "Temporary Name"--

347
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,917
Sh-Shut yer hole, Celeb 17!

348
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,917
Think you're so great even though you suck--

349
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:12,542
--Oh, nothing.
--Are they not on good terms?

350
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:14,708
--No, I humbly ask...
--Actually, I think it's the opposite.

351
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,792
--...that you remain on the line.
--I agree with Mayushii.

352
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:22,208
Maybe I...

353
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:25,208
Maybe I don't need to after all...

354
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,333
Faris.

355
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,667
The discharge has begun.

356
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:30,208
Send it!

357
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,125
Umm...

358
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,083
Who are you?

359
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,708
Huh?

360
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,375
Daddy!

361
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:02,125
"Daddy"?

362
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,958
Were you talking with Kyouma, meow?

363
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,333
Yes.

364
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:09,833
Well, I must be going.
Please, make yourselves at home.

365
00:21:13,292 --> 00:21:16,708
Your father sure seems dignified, Faris-<i>chan</i>!

366
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:21,208
He's Faris-<i>tan</i>'s progenitor, all right!

367
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,125
Umm...!

368
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:26,167
Are you familiar with the IBN 5100?

369
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,125
That name certainly takes me back.

370
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,458
We're looking for one!

371
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:35,083
I gave mine away long ago, I'm sorry to say.

372
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:38,333
Did you happen to give it
to the Yanabayashi Shrine?

373
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:42,083
A shrine? No, I'm afraid not.

374
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,833
Well, I must be going.

375
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:55,750
Before Faris sent her D-mail,

376
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:00,375
the IBN 5100 disappeared
after being stored at the shrine.

377
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:05,333
But now it was never
stored there to begin with.

378
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:10,083
With each message,
things change more and more.

379
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:15,083
There could be things changing
out there I don't even know about.

380
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:27,958
It's possible we've done things
now that can never be undone...

381
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,917
Okarin! Okarin!

382
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:34,917
Mayushii's going to buy an <i>Ai Sword</i>
<i>doujinshi </i>in Nakano before going home.

383
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:37,792
<i>Ai Sword</i>? Oh, by Kouga Yui?

384
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:40,792
Nakano's a pretty long way to go.

385
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,042
Yeah.

386
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:45,917
I wish they'd open a
Toranoana shop here too.

387
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:47,792
What are you talking about?

388
00:22:47,792 --> 00:22:50,083
There's one right--

389
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,208
Huh?!

390
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:55,833
Don't be silly, Okarin.

391
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,167
You know there isn't one in Akiba.

392
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:10,000
<i>Trapped by the covenant and</i>
<i>shown the outline of false evidence</i>

393
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:19,125
<i>the heaven and earth of</i>
<i>life lets time blindly flow by</i>

394
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:28,000
<i>Flutter, butterfly, oh, miraculous</i>
<i>butterfly! I give myself to you</i>

395
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,167
<i>Oh, butterfly of tears,</i>
<i>dazzling butterfly! It's all...</i>

396
00:23:35,167 --> 00:24:02,070
<i>...about to be rewritten now</i>
