1
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:12,792
That's how you die!
Over-dependent and abandoned!

2
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:15,625
In four days, on August 15!

3
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:20,875
The world has set your death
in stone! There's no escaping it!

4
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:24,042
But I refuse to accept that!

5
00:00:24,917 --> 00:00:26,833
I'm going to fight the world!

6
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:31,667
I <i>will </i>save Mayuri!

7
00:00:46,042 --> 00:00:47,833
The coin locker...

8
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:52,792
In front of the Dai Building...

9
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,750
The IBN 5100...

10
00:01:10,792 --> 00:01:16,000
<i>suu juuoku mono kodou no kazu sae</i>

23
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,042
Okabe! What's going on?!

24
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:54,167
Okay! This should do it!

25
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:56,333
Stop!

26
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,333
The IBN 5100's in a coin locker?

27
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,083
Moeka confessed!

28
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,875
And it hasn't been picked up yet!

29
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:06,708
So...?

30
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,167
Isn't it obvious?!

31
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:12,250
--I'm gonna bust into it and--
--Calm down and try to remember.

32
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,958
Remember what?!

33
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,083
Everything so far.

34
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,292
Even after all the D-mails you've undone,

35
00:03:18,292 --> 00:03:22,000
the IBN 5100 has still eluded you.

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,208
I think it might only be possible if
you return to the original world line.

37
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:31,708
And the only way to do
that is to do things in order.

38
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:44,833
Just when it's within arm's reach...

39
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,542
At least we have a lead now.

40
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:53,583
Kiryu Moeka will do
anything this FB person says,

41
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,500
since FB's in charge of the Rounders, right?

42
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,083
In which case...

43
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:08,125
Maybe I'll find FB if
I stake out the IBN 5100...!

44
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,083
What do you want?

45
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:22,958
I... want to meet FB too...

46
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:28,083
I thought you <i>didn't </i>want to?
That she'd hate you if she met you...

47
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:31,875
I want to know the truth...

48
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,500
Why?

49
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,542
I don't know.

50
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:42,500
Did you really think I'd cooperate with you?

51
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:52,583
Well, since there's no
talking sense into you anyway...

52
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,667
Huh?!

53
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,125
What's wrong?

54
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,333
N-Nothing.

55
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:06,667
Kiryu Moeka is with you?!
How did <i>that </i>happen?!

56
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:07,833
Seriously, she's--

57
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,917
That's just how it turned out.

58
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:12,458
I'll let you know if anything happens.

59
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:15,542
Hey! Wait!

60
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:17,500
Urgh...

61
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,542
Okarin?

62
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:20,750
Huh? Yeah.

63
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,667
What's the matter?

64
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,750
It's just...

65
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:34,708
It feels like Okarin and I haven't
talked at all in a long time.

66
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:43,542
Oh, Big Sis Mayuri!

67
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:46,417
Nae-<i>chan</i>!

68
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:48,375
Too-too-roo!

69
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:51,958
Too-too-roo to you too, assistant girl!

70
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:54,875
Call me "Big Sis Kurisu."

71
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,000
Hey, there.

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,333
Hello. Sorry about yesterday...

73
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,958
Tell Okabe I'm upping his rent 5,000 yen.

74
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,375
O-Okay.

75
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,958
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen that bum all day.

76
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,000
He sick or something?

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,750
They say idiots don't catch colds, though...

78
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,708
Oh, I think he's out looking
for stuff for his experiments...

79
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,167
Experiments, huh?

80
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,750
Man, what a happy-go-lucky guy.

81
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,667
Huh?

82
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:23,167
A student with a room all his own,

83
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:27,667
has friends like you guys,
and does whatever he wants...

84
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:29,958
Doesn't get much better than that.

85
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,667
But I'll tell you this...

86
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:36,042
We hafta hurry, Dad!
The sale's about to end!

87
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:37,917
Okay! Let's go, Nae!

88
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:38,667
Yeah!

89
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:40,458
Bye-bye, big sisters!

90
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:41,625
Bye-bye!

91
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,917
What should we have for dinner?

92
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:47,292
Hmm, lemme think...

93
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,292
Old messages from FB?

94
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,250
Can I see?

95
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:23,208
"I think you made the right decision, M4.

96
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,708
To be honest, no one has worked

97
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:29,167
as hard and intently as you, M4."

98
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:30,750
"M4"...?

99
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,208
The code name FB gave me.

100
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,792
Only FB and I know it.

101
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,958
It's a secret.

102
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:47,500
"Maybe you do have a hard
time dealing with other people, M4.

103
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,208
But I think that's part of what makes
you unique. Wouldn't you agree?"

104
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,958
Sounds like a mom, all right...

105
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,167
That's definitely it.

106
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:25,583
The IBN 5100...

107
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:29,625
Then is <i>he </i>FB?

108
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,958
No.

109
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:34,667
FB is a woman.

110
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,000
He's...!

111
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,708
Damn!

112
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:24,833
What's wrong?

113
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,333
I'll explain later.

114
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:03,625
Mr. Braun...

115
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,042
--Say, how long since you last drove?
--Since I got my license.

116
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:19,583
Let's take it nice and easy, then.

117
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,917
Do you recognize that man?

118
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,625
I've never seen him before.

119
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,042
What does this mean?

120
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:42,625
In four days, on August 15!

121
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,542
The world has set your death in stone!

122
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:47,625
There's no escaping it!

123
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,833
A plane headed to France...

124
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,042
That's where SERN is.

125
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:34,250
We didn't see any women
who could've been FB.

126
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:39,042
You can at least call!

127
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:41,625
I've had my hands full.

128
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,667
I personally don't care.

129
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:45,625
It's just...

130
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,667
It's Mayuri who's...

131
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:54,333
Now that you mention it, I feel like
I haven't talked to her in a long time.

132
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:57,375
She said the same thing.

133
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,208
I'm sorry.

134
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:04,458
--Let's go.
--Huh?

135
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,083
Our only option is to confront him directly.

136
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:09,208
Confront who?

137
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,292
Someone we know very well.

138
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:29,208
Oh! What brings you
here so early in the morning?

139
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,333
Well, come in.

140
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,375
So, what do you want?

141
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:39,667
Come to pay the extra
6,000 yen on your rent, huh?

142
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:44,042
Hey, this is the part where
you're supposed to butt in and say,

143
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:47,375
"That's 1,000 yen more than you said!"

144
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:50,917
I would like to ask you something.

145
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:53,583
Geez, why so formal?

146
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:58,917
You know about someone
named "FB," do you not?

147
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,375
We've seen everything.

148
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:05,250
Including the IBN 5100
being hauled away from here.

149
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:12,125
We mean you no harm.
We simply wish to meet with FB.

150
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,333
Please, tell us. Where can we find her?

151
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,500
Looks like you're a traitor, M4.

152
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:28,500
FB gave me that code name...

153
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,458
It's a secret name only FB and I know...

154
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,250
--Are you saying...?!
--How can that be?!

155
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,833
Ever heard of Ferdinand Braun?

156
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:41,208
The Nobel Prize physicist
who invented the CRT?

157
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,625
Impressive.

158
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,917
And what are his initials?

159
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:47,208
"F.B."...

160
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,708
So <i>you're</i>...?!

161
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:54,042
No... That's not possible...

162
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:57,833
First, overdependence, and now escapism?

163
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,792
Nae is asleep. Let's go elsewhere.

164
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:11,375
This damn city just keeps changin'.

165
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,792
Are you really FB?

166
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:15,333
Yeah.

167
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,333
But the e-mails...!

168
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,625
I wrote 'em all.

169
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,875
Why did I write like a woman?

170
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,667
To fool you, of course.

171
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,833
--That can't be--
--It ain't just you.

172
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,875
I do it with the others, too.

173
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:35,375
I send them e-mails pretending
to be whoever they most need.

174
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:41,625
It helps that people like
you are also the easiest to trick.

175
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,375
Why'd you cut off contact with her?

176
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:48,875
She outlived her usefulness the
moment she found the IBN 5100.

177
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,250
So I got rid of her.

178
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,917

179
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:56,375
People like that are easiest to deal with...

180
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,958
...and easiest to get rid of
once they're no longer useful.

181
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,042
They have nowhere they belong, after all.

182
00:15:02,042 --> 00:15:04,542
I can't believe <i>you're </i>a SERN lapdog...

183
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:06,042
A dog?

184
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:07,833
Suzuha didn't...

185
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,875
Hashida Suzu-<i>san </i>didn't take care of you

186
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,042
so you could go and do <i>this</i>!

187
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:18,208
How do <i>you </i>know Suzu-<i>san</i>?

188
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,792
This has nothing to do with her.

189
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:24,792
This has nothing to do with Suzu-<i>san</i>!

190
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:27,667
--But...!
--What would <i>you </i>know?!

191
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:40,542
You ever slept in a manhole
in the middle of winter?

192
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:42,458
I was still just a kid...

193
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:46,750
The concrete was freezing.
Bone-chillingly cold.

194
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,542
I wouldn't eat for
three or four days at a time.

195
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:54,292
And whenever I'd lie down, <i>they </i>would come...

196
00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:55,833
Huh?

197
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:56,833
The rats.

198
00:15:56,833 --> 00:16:00,125
They'd gnaw at me,
mistaking me for a corpse.

199
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:06,375
That's when I saw a thread dangling down.

200
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,042
A spider's thread...

201
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:10,958
I <i>had </i>to climb up it, y'know?

202
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:16,583
Even if following it meant
getting my hands dirty.

203
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:25,583
So I climbed the thread...

204
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:29,042
And before I knew it,
I was a puppet on strings.

205
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:34,375
There's no escape.

206
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,708
Once a puppet breaks loose from its strings...

207
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:25,375
"Traitors get death," as they say.

208
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:30,125
Well, they off you after you've
served your purpose, anyway.

209
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,708
You called me a dog earlier.

210
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,500
We ain't dogs.

211
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,708
We're livestock.

212
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:41,667
I thought about escaping before.

213
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:46,708
But now I have something precious to me.

214
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:50,167
I didn't wanna drag her into this.

215
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:54,208
But... failure isn't allowed.

216
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,875
Try to run, and they'll
go after your family too.

217
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,875
I've failed, too.

218
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:06,125
But Nae doesn't know a thing.

219
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:11,417
If I just die...

220
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:13,542
Wait--!

221
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:41,333
O-Okabe... <i>kun</i>...

222
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,500
Okabe-<i>kun</i>...

223
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,583
S-Sorry...

224
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:57,750
I'm... sorry...

225
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,792
O-Okabe! His phone!

226
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:10,375
The D-mail!

227
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,042
Okabe!

228
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,458
Moeka...?

229
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:44,000
You don't need it...?

230
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,917
Hello, this is Urushibara!

231
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:55,125
Oh, Kyouma-<i>s</i>--

232
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:58,625
Huh? An IBN 5100?

233
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,500
Actually, we do!

234
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,042
This is it...!

235
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,708
Daru!

236
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,292
Hashida's not here.

237
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,750
He said he's going to Comima, remember?

238
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,792
I beg you!

239
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:19,292
Hear my request!

240
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:24,125
I see.

241
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:28,125
The only way to prevent Mayuri's
death is to leave this alpha world line

242
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:33,750
and return to the world line that
exists before you send your first D-mail...

243
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,042
The beta world line, in other words.

244
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:38,083
And the only way to do <i>that</i>

245
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:41,167
is to delete that data
from SERN's database.

246
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:43,000
All this stuff about Mayushii dying

247
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,875
and Miss Amane being my future daughter...

248
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:50,167
If this is all just in your head, you
could totally be a light novel author!

249
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:52,292
Nothing would make me happier.

250
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,083
Do you believe it, Miss Makise?

251
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,667
As a hypothesis, at least.

252
00:20:55,667 --> 00:21:01,417
I'd love some actual, objective data,
but that's obviously impossible.

253
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:05,042
The time leap machine
you built worked perfectly.

254
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:08,042
Huh? R-Really?

255
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:10,708
I mean, o-of course it did!

256
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,583
Not to mention...

257
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,792
What?

258
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:19,458
--Never mind.
--Wh-What?!

259
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,542
I said never mind.

260
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:22,542
All hooked up!

261
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:26,750
I gotta config some stuff, but
we'll be good to go in 10 minutes.

262
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,583
We're counting on you, Super hax0r!

263
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,667
"Super <i>hacker</i>"!

264
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,417
The first D-mail, huh?

265
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:38,375
That's the one where you said
I got stabbed or whatever, wasn't it?

266
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:44,667
I bet you tried to feel me up, huh?

267
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:54,042
Undoing all our D-mails will
return us to the original world line.

268
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:59,958
A world line where SERN's
dystopia never occurs...

269
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:03,000
A world line where Mayuri lives...

270
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,708
And a world line where...

271
00:22:09,292 --> 00:22:11,000
...Makise Kurisu...

272
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:15,792
...dies.
