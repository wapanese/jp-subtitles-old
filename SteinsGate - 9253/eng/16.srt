1
00:00:07,792 --> 00:00:12,042
Yes. That guest say,
"Make me please a badge."

2
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:14,833
Same as one you had.

3
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:18,458
So this guy asked you
to make that badge?!

4
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,958
What did he look like?!

5
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,417
Look like?

6
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:26,750
Hmm.

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,375
Like a barrel.

8
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,750
--A barrel?
--Barrel Titor?!

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,000
Titor?

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,500
No, no.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,458
Just like barrel.

12
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,042
Just like barrel...?

13
00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:41,583
--"Barrel" in Japanese is "<i>taru</i>"!
--"<i>Taru</i>"?!

14
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,750
I learned it from the
Rai-Net anime a while ago!

15
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,417
There was a bad guy
called the Barrel Monster--

16
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:48,750
Yes.

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,542
Just "<i>taru</i>."

18
00:00:50,542 --> 00:00:51,667
...Or balloon?

19
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:55,042
So he's a big guy who looks
like a barrel or a balloon?

20
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:57,042
How can we contact him?!

21
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:58,333
Sorry.

22
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:01,667
Private information. Nothing.

23
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,417
No leads, huh...

24
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:11,583
But he'll go back to pick up his
badge when it's finished, right?

25
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,583
Apparently he left without placing an order

26
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:16,042
when the guy said it'd take a week to make.

27
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:17,667
Oh.

28
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:20,792
Maybe it's a lost cause after all...

29
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:22,958
No.

30
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,875
There's still another way.

31
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:28,958
If I wait for the time leap
machine to be finished tomorrow

32
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:31,042
and then go back in time...

Where's Suzuha?

47
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,208
She just left, remember?

48
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,542
What's gotten into you?

49
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:17,208
I'll explain later!

50
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,458
Crap!

51
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:24,542
I forgot to ask what
time the guy showed up!

52
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:26,542
Hey, how can I help you?

53
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:28,458
Is that him?!

54
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:34,625
He <i>does </i>have a barrel-ish,
balloon-ish silhouette...

55
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,750
Daru?!

56
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,833
Ack! Okarin?!

57
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,458
Geez...

58
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,958
Why would you make a
fake copy of the badge?!

59
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:49,583
I'd feel bad if we never found
Miss Amane's old man, y'know?

60
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:54,292
So I figured I could at least show
her the badge and make up a fake Titor!

61
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:57,625
So you were gonna
give her false happiness?!

62
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,792
Lies come in two types:

63
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:02,208
lies that harm and lies that comfort--

64
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:06,958
Do you honestly think Suzuha
would be happy if she found out?!

65
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:18,125
Miss Amane told me
not to tell anyone, but...

66
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,125
That time machine...

67
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:23,167
...can only go backward in time.

68
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,667
Once she leaves, there's no coming back.

69
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:34,542
How's it going?

70
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:36,708
For you.

71
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:41,500
Oh! An ice-cold, no-calorie
cola is just what I needed!

72
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,125
You're Mr. Nice Guy!

73
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,667
Well? Do you think you can repair it?

74
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:47,833
Should have it done by tomorrow.

75
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,542
Wow! I know it's a rush job, but wow!

76
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:52,917
Daru's got serious skills, all right.

77
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,958
I told you, don't judge a book by its cover.

78
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:55,833
Huh?

79
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,167
You did?

80
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:02,625
But you're right; he does seem so
unhealthy and drab on the outside!

81
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,917
Yeah! I've changed my opinion of him!

82
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:07,333
Then you can help me too, Miss Amane.

83
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,833
And, inside the cramped time machine,
the sweltering heat will be so much

84
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,833
that we'll forget our
embarrassment and strip our clothes...

85
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,417
Have some self-respect, pervert!

86
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:18,667
Daru-<i>kun </i>and Suzu-<i>san</i>
sure make a good match!

87
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:25,875
Listen, I feel like I might never
get another chance to say this,

88
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,583
so I'll just say it now...

89
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:32,792
I'm really grateful to you all.

90
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:37,375
When I first came to this time
period, I didn't know anyone,

91
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,458
and even though this
era's so much more peaceful,

92
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:44,250
I found it really frightening.

93
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,083
But now I have so many friends.

94
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:55,583
I really had a lot of fun, coming to
this era and spending time with you.

95
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,417
Even if it was for a short time,
I'm glad to have been a fellow lab member.

96
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:03,750
I'm glad... I could be with you guys.

97
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,208
Once she leaves, there's no coming back.

98
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,667
Okabe Rintaro!

99
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:12,875
--Promise you'll--
--I <i>will </i>change the future!

100
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:18,000
I'll make it a free world, like it is now!

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,292
Okabe Rintaro...?

102
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:20,958
You don't...

103
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:24,833
You don't regret making
memories with us, do you?

104
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:29,292
If parting ways is inevitable...

105
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:35,833
You don't regret being friends with
us and wish it never happened, do you?

106
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:39,417
Wait, did Hashida Itaru tell you...?

107
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:42,500
He's concerned about you too.

108
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,750
I <i>am </i>going!

109
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,583
Changing the future was my dad's--

110
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:52,250
But don't you care what that'll mean for you?!

111
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,083
The 70s aren't so bad either.

112
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,042
I can make some
more friends like you guys

113
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:02,208
and live a life of freedom!

114
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:12,458
Here goes nothing!

115
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:20,583
I think it should be okay now, but
you might wanna do one last check.

116
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,250
Right!

117
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,083
Yeah! It looks okay!

118
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:30,042
You're really amazing!

119
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:34,583
You should be happier!
You just fixed a time machine!

120
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:38,708
What month and day in 1975 should I pick?!

121
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,500
Should I go to a Capricorn day?
Or maybe an Aquarius day?

122
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,042
No, that's for weddings!

123
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:46,083
Oh, but an Aquarius day sounds good.

124
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,208
You might make new
friends faster that way...

125
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:52,458
Friends, huh?! I can't wait!

126
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:58,542
"FG204"...?

127
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:00,583
Say, Suzu-<i>san</i>!

128
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,833
Yes?

129
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,167
Is this...?

130
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:08,250
Oh, that's the time machine's name!
My dad came up with it!

131
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:18,125
M-My bicycle...?

132
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,417
We thought it might fit
if we took the tires off!

133
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,542
You're really fond of it, right?

134
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,458
Yeah. I'll cherish it.

135
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,000
Thank you.

136
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,875
Aha!

137
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:37,750
Mayushii knows who
your father is, Suzu-<i>san</i>!

138
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,042
--What?!
--Huh?!

139
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:45,167
Not only that, he's right nearby!

140
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,333
Wh-Where?!

141
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:52,917
I kept thinking they were a
good match for some reason!

142
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:58,750
But now I know it's because they're family!

143
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,708
W-Wait! You're not saying...?!

144
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,708
Suzu-<i>san</i>'s father...

145
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,833
...is Daru-<i>kun</i>!

146
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,333
Huh...?!

147
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,833
That's not a funny joke!

148
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,750
Besides, who would
ever marry <i>this </i>pervert--

149
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,833
Whoa, no need to be mean!

150
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:19,917
Explain! What led you to this conclusion?!

151
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:23,375
First, "barrel" is "<i>taru</i>" in Japanese, right?

152
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,667
<i>Taru</i>... Daru...

153
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:26,917
Daru-<i>kun</i>!

154
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:29,500
--Word play?!
--You call <i>that </i>a legitimate reason?

155
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,708
But Suzu-<i>san</i>'s resistance
group was founded in part

156
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:37,208
by Okarin and Barrel Titor-<i>san</i>, right?

157
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,208
And the only one who'd know

158
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,750
about your independent time
machine research in Akiba in 2010

159
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,750
and that you have the Reading Stinger--

160
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,333
"Reading Steiner."

161
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:50,833
Yeah. The only one who'd know
about that is Daru-<i>kun</i>, right?

162
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:56,500
And the best evidence of
all that Mayushii found is...

163
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,333
The time machine's name?

164
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,417
FG204.

165
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:03,708
It's a Future Gadget!

166
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,083
A Future Gadget?!

167
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:09,167
And see the writing next to it too?

168
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:16,500
Future Gadget 204, 2nd Edition, Version 2.31?!

169
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,875
That naming style...!

170
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:30,875
Dad...?

171
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:34,375
A-At times like this,
you should call me "Daddy"!

172
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,167
This is no time to act like a pervert!

173
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,625
Dad...

174
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,625
Y-Yeah.

175
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,500
I came.

176
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,292
I came to see you, Dad.

177
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:56,917
In the time machine <i>you </i>built...

178
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:58,583
Yeah...

179
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:03,167
I <i>will </i>accomplish what you strived to do!

180
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:05,333
So watch me.

181
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:08,583
I-I will.

182
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,875
I swear it.

183
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,417
Incidentally...

184
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:24,083
Was your mom cute?

185
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,958
I'm hoping for someone short with
a baby face and humongous boobs...

186
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,500
I think I'll keep it a secret!

187
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,333
Well, I should probably get going.

188
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,250
Yeah.

189
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,875
Don't forget about us, now!

190
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:43,958
Be careful.

191
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,292
I'll be okay.

192
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:49,000
I <i>will </i>get the IBN 5100, just you watch!

193
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,125
And then I'll get it into your hands!

194
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:55,750
So, please, change the future.

195
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:01,083
I'll see you again in 35 years!

196
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:04,292
I guess it'll only be a
few hours for you, though.

197
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:09,458
Suzu-<i>san</i>!

198
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,000
Suzuha!

199
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,750
Let's meet again, okay?!

200
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,042
I'll stay strong until then!

201
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:39,542
So you stay strong too--!

202
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:50,625
Good luck...!

203
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:56,708
We've just received word that
the space satellite on the roof

204
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,542
of the Radio Building in
Akihabara has gone missing.

205
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:05,292
Hey, do you think these
were <i>our </i>initials on this badge?

206
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:08,375
Okabe's "O," Hashida's "H," Shiina's "S"...

207
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,417
Oh!

208
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:13,500
Then the "M" is for "Makise,"
and the "A" is for "Amane"!

209
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,792
A lab member badge!
Wanna make one ourselves?

210
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:17,917
Good idea!

211
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:21,458
What's wrong, Okabe?

212
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:25,125
The Divergence Meter's
number hasn't changed.

213
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:30,917
Maybe it'll change after the present-day
Amane-<i>san </i>brings us the IBN 5100?

214
00:13:30,917 --> 00:13:34,292
Suzuha should be 54 now, right?

215
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:38,208
My own daughter's over
three decades older than me...

216
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,958
She could be married and
have grandchildren by now!

217
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:45,125
I-In other words, I could
see my own great-grandkids

218
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,542
while I'm still so young!

219
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:51,667
You'll need to spoil them like
crazy, like a good great-grandpa!

220
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,292
It's her!

221
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,750
Mr. Braun?!

222
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,042
A letter?

223
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,583
Hashida Suzu...?!

224
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:17,958
Could it be Suzu-<i>san</i>?!

225
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,750
Seriously?! Then why is Mr. Braun...?

226
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,208
That letter's from someone
who helped me out long ago.

227
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,875
She asked me to give it
to you on this exact day.

228
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,208
Where is she now?!

229
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,000
She's dead.

230
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,375
Died ten years ago.

231
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:41,083
"Dear Okabe Rintaro...

232
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:44,458
It's been a long while. This is Amane Suzuha.

233
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:48,083
For you, it's probably
only a few hours since I left.

234
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:52,417
It's currently June 13, 2000.

235
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:54,583
I'll get straight to the point.

236
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,583
I failed.

237
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:01,750
I failed. I failed. I failed.

238
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:08,333
I failed. I failed.
I failed. I failed. I failed.

239
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:14,250
I failed. I failed. I failed. I failed.

240
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:19,458
I only remembered
who I am a mere year ago.

241
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:24,083
I had amnesia the 24 years before that.

242
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,833
The time traveling didn't work right.

243
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:30,167
The repairs were incomplete.

244
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:35,167
But it wasn't your fault, Dad. It was mine!

245
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:39,500
I should've just gone straight back to 1975.

246
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,542
I should never have stopped by 2010!

247
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:45,208
I shouldn't have been so selfish!

248
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,542
The future won't change now!

249
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:52,583
I couldn't get the IBN 5100.

250
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,750
I'm sorry...

251
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,958
I'm so sorry!

252
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:06,583
Why did I even live to this age?

253
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:10,417
I forgot my duty and
lived a carefree life instead!

254
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:11,625
Forgive me!

255
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,708
Forgive me! Forgive me! Forgive me!

256
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:19,000
Okabe Rintaro, after that
time machine forum meeting,

257
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,083
you stopped me
from going back to 1975.

258
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,667
You stopped me,

259
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:29,625
and the thunderstorm that
night broke the time machine.

260
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:36,375
If you can turn back time, I ask
that you don't stop me that day.

261
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,833
My life...

262
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,833
...was a waste."

263
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:55,167
Mr. Braun.

264
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:59,083
What do <i>you </i>want?
What's with the long faces?

265
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:04,583
Please, tell me how Hashida Suzu-<i>san </i>died.

266
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,667
What's it to you?

267
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:10,083
I need to know how she died!

268
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:15,458
I need to etch it into my mind,
no matter how it happened...!

269
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:20,542
Sounds like it's more
than just simple curiosity.

270
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:24,208
But what kind of relationship
did <i>you </i>have with Suzu-<i>san</i>?

271
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,833
We were... old acquaintances.

272
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,125
Very old.

273
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:34,917
But even now I remember the time
we shared together like it was yesterday!

274
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:38,375
I don't really wanna talk about it, but...

275
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,292
...it was suicide.

276
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,958
She hanged herself in her home.

277
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:50,042
She'd been mentally unstable
the year leading up to it.

278
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:59,167
But she'd always been a
cheerful, kind woman before then...

279
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,792
It's my fault...

280
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:17,958
The time machine broke
because I stopped Suzuha that night...

281
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:23,958
If only I hadn't sent that D-mail,
she could've safely traveled to 1975!

282
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,625
Okarin...

283
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:30,250
Hold on, Okabe! What are you doing?!

284
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,625
At this rate, Mayuri will end up...!

285
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:39,792
You're sending a D-mail, Okarin?!

286
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:43,083
It'll all disappear if you do that!

287
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,542
I know...

288
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:48,250
All the memories we made with
Suzu-<i>san </i>will never have happened!

289
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,583
I know!

290
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:55,042
So, please, change the future.

291
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:56,917
Okarin!

292
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:09,250
What do <i>you </i>want, Okabe?

293
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:14,958
Hashida Suzu, huh...

294
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,917
That name brings back memories.

295
00:19:16,917 --> 00:19:19,333
You knew her?

296
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,708
Yes...

297
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,167
Umm, do you know where she is now?

298
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:26,583
It's been almost ten years now, I'd say...

299
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,375
She really helped me out.

300
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:33,042
I wish I could've at
least looked after her...

301
00:19:33,042 --> 00:19:35,333
It was a suicide, then?

302
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,292
Huh?! A disease did her in!

303
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:42,667
I live in her old house now!

304
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,125
That bike...!

305
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:51,750
Yeah. Suzu-<i>san </i>cherished it like crazy.

306
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:56,083
I couldn't bring myself to throw it out,
so it's been sitting here for 10 years.

307
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:02,042
At first, Suzu-<i>san </i>and
I were just regular neighbors.

308
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:06,208
When I lost my house in a
fire--along with everything in it--

309
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:11,000
she rented out a room here to me.

310
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,375
Was she all alone until then?

311
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:17,000
I don't think she ever married.

312
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,208
She was an unusual woman.

313
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,208
I once asked her why she was being so nice

314
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:25,458
to a complete stranger she had no relation to.

315
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:29,042
She smiled and answered with,

316
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:33,375
"People's lives are a cycle
of helping and being helped.

317
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:38,792
So someday you'll need to
help someone else yourself."

318
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:41,750
Oh, yeah. Just a minute.

319
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,250
This used to be Suzu-<i>san</i>'s.

320
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:49,208
Do you know what the number means?

321
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:53,083
When she was sick in bed, she
always gazed at this, saying things like,

322
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:59,292
"Is this number before the change
or after the change? Did I change it?"

323
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:03,083
It was always on her mind to the very end.

324
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,917
The divergence number's changed.

325
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:14,167
But it's still under 1%...

326
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:18,042
The train on the outer loop
line will be arriving shortly.

327
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:22,833
--Please stay behind the yellow line.
--The Yamanote Line is running now?!

328
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,333
Mayuri!

329
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:30,417
Damn!

330
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,500
Mayuri!

331
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,875
What's with you, Okarin?

332
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,625
Nothing.

333
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:57,750
Oh, Mayushii's phone was
ringing earlier. Was that you?

334
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,458
She was so fast asleep I couldn't wake her up.

335
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:09,375
Suzuha...

336
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:12,583
Has the world changed now?

337
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:16,792
Has Mayuri been saved now?
