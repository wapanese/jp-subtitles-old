1
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:26,750
Me, a savior?

2
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,375
Nonsense! I'm a mad scientist!

3
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:33,333
I long for destruction and chaos!

4
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,750
What's gotten into you, dude?

5
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:50,250
We're recommencing Operation Urd.

6
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,125
Huh? But Mr. Braun's downstairs...

7
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:54,667
--I don't care!
--Wait!

8
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:57,667
I told you before. I'm against it.

9
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:01,458
What gives? You were
all for it this afternoon.

10
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:04,083
This afternoon?

11
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:06,250
So you really did go and...?

12
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,458
Yes. The experiment took place.

13
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:12,833
The D-mail has already altered the past.

14
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,000
You serious?

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,083
You're saying the world line changed?

16
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,208
Most likely.

17
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:22,208
That's why you've lost some of
your memories prior to the change.

18
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:25,625
Are you talking about that Loto 6 thing?

19
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:27,500
Yes.

20
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,292
So, why do <i>you </i>still have memories of it?

21
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:36,792
Titor said I might have an ability...

22
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:42,542
We need to move the world
line again to find out for sure.

23
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:44,042
An ability?

24
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:48,042
The ability to retain
memories across world lines...

25
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:51,333
The all-seeing eye... "Reading Steiner."

00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:47,583
Daru.

40
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:50,500
Nothing in the outbox. The inbox has...

41
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,542
Oh! The D-mail arrived five days ago!

42
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:55,083
It worked.

43
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,333
Well, did the past change?!

44
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:00,292
How would you remember this if it did?

45
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:08,417
We sent a D-mail to
Daru five days in the past,

46
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:11,333
telling him the positions
of cards at the Faris Cup,

47
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,833
which should've let him win...

48
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:17,042
Oh, Mayushii? I got a question for you.

49
00:04:17,042 --> 00:04:19,417
That Faris Cup the other day, did I--?

50
00:04:19,417 --> 00:04:22,750
Huh? I lost? In the blink of an eye?

51
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,417
Oh. I see.

52
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:27,000
Thanks. Bye.

53
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:36,000
The message for Daru
didn't change the past.

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,750
It <i>should've </i>changed the flow of the game.

55
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,792
I guess it takes more than
that to move the world line.

56
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:48,125
We need an easier way to tell
if we've changed the past or not...

57
00:04:49,417 --> 00:04:50,167
Oh?

58
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:55,000
I-I'm not saying that I agree
with these experiments, though!

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,292
So, what do you think about it?

60
00:04:57,292 --> 00:05:00,375
Why are you the only one
who retains your memories?

61
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:05,417
I already told you--I have
the Reading Steiner ability.

62
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:13,542
To find out for sure, though,
I'll have you send the next D-mail.

63
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:15,458
I don't want to.

64
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,333
Worried about a time paradox?

65
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:22,958
Changing the past
somehow just feels... unfair.

66
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:29,792
I've only been alive eighteen years,
but I don't want to change any of it.

67
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:33,083
It's <i>my </i>life, failures and all.

68
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,292
But you <i>also </i>love experiments.

69
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:39,208
--Isn't that right?
--S-So?! What's wrong with that?!

70
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,208
In other words, you prefer to sit back

71
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,458
and watch with a grin on
your face as others are sacrificed.

72
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:47,125
Indeed, you're a true mad scientist.

73
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,792
Whatever!

74
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:51,458
Seriously, though--

75
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:01,250
Seriously, though, the only
way to perfect the D-mail system...

76
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,750
...is to perform more experiments...

77
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,458
Kiryu-<i>san</i>?

78
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,208
She talks too much!

79
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,833
Can I?

80
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:25,333
She completely overwhelmed us...

81
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:31,917
Here we are! Home sweet home!

82
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:35,917
--Those were good crepes, huh?
--Yeah!

83
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:37,958
Oh? You look like you got nothin' to do.

84
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,708
I'm waiting for someone.

85
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,833
Hey, now! I told you to quit scarin' Nae!

86
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,708
I haven't done a thing!

87
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:51,500
Come on, Nae! Let's
forget about this loser and go!

88
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,000
Good morning!

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,708
Big Sis Mayuri!

90
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,083
Too-too-roo!

91
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,708
For you!

92
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,583
Wow, thanks!

93
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,083
And for you, Okarin!

94
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,667
Yo!

95
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,542
Good morning, Suzu-<i>san</i>!

96
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:18,250
Part-time girl!

97
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,500
Hey, tell me! What happened afterward?

98
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,125
--What are you talking about?
--The time machine!

99
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,583
--Did you talk to John Titor?
--Oh, yeah.

100
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:31,500
But now I'm not so sure if he's right...

101
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,167
Huh?!

102
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:35,375
--What do you mean?!
--Huh?

103
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:38,250
Why are you so worked up about it?

104
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,375
Ah, you're a Titor fangirl, aren't you?

105
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,583
No!

106
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:43,958
Oh, Kurisu-<i>chan</i>!

107
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,417
Too-too-roo!

108
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:47,167
Good morning.

109
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:01,250
Ah, she sent sparks flying again, huh?

110
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,583
Sheesh, what's her problem?

111
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,625
Fighting is sad.

112
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:09,375
Oh, don't worry! Everything's fine!

113
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,917
Thank you.

114
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:13,583
Keep it a simple, impersonal message,

115
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:17,667
preferably one that'll make it easy
to tell if the past was changed or not.

116
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:28,333
"I got a new phone four days ago,
but I wanna tell myself not to buy it."

117
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:33,625
I see. If the past changes, so will her phone.

118
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,167
The result will be obvious.

119
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:38,167
Then let the experiment begin!

120
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:47,833
Okay!

121
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,167
All right!

122
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:52,250
Start up the Phone
Microwave (Temporary Name)--!

123
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,625
It's so round!

124
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,875
What's this for?

125
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,875
This is, umm, to make up

126
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:06,000
for messing up the Loto 6
ticket you asked me to buy.

127
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,917
Oh. That's very nice--

128
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:11,458
You possess providence, indeed.

129
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,042
Soon your mind's eye shall finally open.

130
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:16,875
Thank you! Well, I should be off now!

131
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,292
You're leaving already?

132
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:22,500
You seem to be in the
middle of something, so...

133
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,917
Goodbye!

134
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:28,000
Come try on Mayushii's
costumes sometime, okay?!

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,333
I-I'm sorry. That's not really my thing...

136
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,917
Aww, you don't want to?

137
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:35,500
I think you'd look nice in them, though...

138
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,958
See you later!

139
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,625
Yeah! Bye-bye!

140
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:44,000
What a nice person.

141
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:11,417
I felt it this time...

142
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:14,000
Which means...

143
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,042
...the past changed?

144
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,292
Wh-Where did Shining Finger go?!

145
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:32,125
"Shi"? Huh?

146
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,417
Japanese, please.

147
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,292
Did Rukako stop by...?

148
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:50,375
Ruka-<i>kun</i>? No, he hasn't.

149
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,208
Then what about Moeka?!
What about her?!

150
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:57,000
Moeka-<i>san</i>? Who's that?

151
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,458
Kiryu Moeka! Did she not come by today?!

152
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,375
Well?!

153
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,417
Huh?!

154
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,542
Who are you talking about?

155
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:10,167
Kiryu Moeka? I've never
heard of her either.

156
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:12,417
What?!

157
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:14,542
Wait, did we send another D-mail?!

158
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:16,958
Huh? Then what does this mean?!

159
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,958
Did we change the past

160
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,750
and cause Kiryu Moeka
to cease to exist entirely...?

161
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,875
That can't be!

162
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:30,292
I still have mail from
her up until July 31st!

163
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:43,667
"What's the matter?
Sorry, but I'm a little busy.

164
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:45,917
I'll e-mail you later."

165
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:54,000
In short, the past--and this
Kiryu Moeka-<i>san</i>'s actions--changed

166
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,167
when she received the
message four days ago,

167
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:01,792
causing her to never visit the lab?

168
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:05,000
Pretty much.

169
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,083
And your ability to remember...
Your "Reading Steiner," was it?

170
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,792
That's an embarrassing term, by the way.

171
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:16,833
I'd drop it if I were you.

172
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:21,792
Your personal opinions are unneeded.

173
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:25,375
Your ability to retain
memories across world lines...

174
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,875
Is it real?

175
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,917
Okay, I'm ready!

176
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:36,917
We can talk more tomorrow.

177
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:39,625
See you tomorrow, Okarin!

178
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,208
The ability is real.

179
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,792
Then...

180
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:48,417
...am I...?

181
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:55,583
Honestly, I don't know
how they can sleep in that lab.

182
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,542
They say that's what a mad scientist does!

183
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:02,292
Say! We should have a sleepover sometime!

184
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:04,375
Sure, if it's girls-only.

185
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:07,208
Oh, I know! Want to
come to my hotel room?

186
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,750
Can I?!

187
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,542
Of course.

188
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:10,625
Okay!

189
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,417
Then I'll come visit you sometime!

190
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,750
Ruka-<i>kun</i>! Too-too-roo!

191
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,750
Huh?!

192
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,875
Really?!

193
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:27,708
What?!

194
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,000
You didn't bring the
Supernatural Sword Samidare?!

195
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,708
--Huh? Uhh...
--Stop that, Okarin!

196
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:36,625
Ruka-<i>kun </i>is Mayushii's guest today!

197
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,667
You wanted to try on my costumes, right?!

198
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,583
I-I, uhh...

199
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,208
Okay, Ruka-<i>kun</i>! Let's transform you!

200
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,542
Transform, transform!

201
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,500
A-Actually, I...!

202
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,375
Now, let's get those clothes off you!

203
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,708
Don't touch there...!

204
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:57,000
Okay! I'll put it on myself!
Just please look away...!

205
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,542
It's tricky putting this on, though.

206
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:02,250
P-Please, don't take that off...!

207
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,000
It's very... <i>yuri</i>.

208
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,333
Not quite. Rukako is a guy.

209
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,333
That makes it...

210
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,375
...even more indecent!

211
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,458
It's Kirari-<i>chan </i>from Rai-Net!

212
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:26,917
I was right! It looks cute on you, Ruka-<i>kun</i>!

213
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:29,208
Wearing this is embarrassing...

214
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:33,083
It's okay! Cuteness is just!

215
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,667
I have the urge to get an upskirt shot...

216
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,500
What do you think, Okarin?

217
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,125
Well...

218
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,167
It's me! I've been subjected to
intense psychological warfare!

219
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:50,250
Oh, no! My mind! It's... being eaten away!

220
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,833
Wh-What's wrong, Kyouma-<i>san</i>?

221
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,792
Sheesh, what's all the fuss about?

222
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:58,500
Kurisu-<i>chan</i>! Too-too-roo!

223
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:07,417
Perverted Assistant.
Quit gawking at Rukako's body.

224
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:08,875
I'm not!

225
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,125
Another indecent development!

226
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:14,292
What do you think? Does this
costume look nice on Ruka-<i>kun</i>?

227
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:17,000
Y-Yes! It's very cute!

228
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,750
C-Cute...? That's not...

229
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,833
Let's try on some other clothes!

230
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,125
Wait...

231
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:30,083
I came by today because
I have a favor to ask.

232
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,083
You didn't come to try on my costumes?

233
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:38,292
Th-That's what I kept trying to say,
but you wouldn't hear me out.

234
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:40,333
Sorry! I was just so
happy that I couldn't help it...

235
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,292
So, what is this request of yours?

236
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:44,458
Umm, well, you see...

237
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:49,542
I want to send a message to the past too!

238
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,750
Yesterday...

239
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:57,042
I brought a present to make up
for messing up the Loto 6 ticket,

240
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:59,208
but then...

241
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,083
Wait, did we send another D-mail?!

242
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,750
Huh? Then what does this mean?!

243
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,542
Did we change the past

244
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:09,875
and cause Kiryu Moeka
to cease to exist entirely...?

245
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,542
That can't be!

246
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:17,042
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but...!

247
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:21,417
Ruka-<i>kun</i>. What message do
you want to send to the past?

248
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:23,708
Well, actually...

249
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,833
I want to be a girl!

250
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,500
Huh?!

251
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:34,333
I don't like the way I look...

252
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:38,583
I've always felt that I might
feel more confident with myself

253
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:41,292
if I were a girl...

254
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:44,917
H-Hold on!

255
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:48,708
What on earth is she talking about?

256
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:53,625
Assistant. It appears
you've made a crucial mistake.

257
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,167
A mistake?

258
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:58,083
Rukako isn't a girl. He's a guy.

259
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,417
What kind of joke is that?

260
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:01,958
How short-sighted.

261
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:06,625
If you're a real scientist,
then observe for yourself.

262
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:14,833
Someone this cute
can't possibly be a boy...

263
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,875
Sorry, I hope you don't mind.

264
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,375
Are you okay?

265
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:29,958
I'm serious about this!
I really want to be a girl!

266
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,458
Please!

267
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:37,500
Still, I'm not sure sending a
D-mail can change your gender.

268
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,833
I've heard that if you eat lots
of meat while you're pregnant,

269
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,833
you'll have a baby boy.

270
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:48,667
And that if you eat lots of
vegetables instead, it'll be a girl.

271
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:52,667
So you want to send a D-mail telling
your mother to eat lots of vegetables?

272
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:54,833
Yes. Could I?

273
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:58,583
Very well. I will grant your wish.

274
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,208
Thank you so much!

275
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:03,292
--That's great news, Ruka-<i>kun</i>!
--Yes!

276
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:06,333
Wouldn't changing
someone's gender be a bad idea?

277
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:10,458
Do you seriously think some vegetables
can change something like that?

278
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:14,042
That's true. There's not
even any scientific basis for it.

279
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:18,583
He's clearly been struggling with this.
If it'll make him feel better...

280
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:24,083
Rukako. As of today, you
are one of us: Lab Member 006!

281
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,458
R-Right!

282
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,083
Now, then! Let us get
the experiment underway--

283
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,417
You're 17 this year, right?

284
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:32,042
Huh? Yes.

285
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:35,958
Which would mean you were born in 1993...?

286
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,792
Why do you ask?

287
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:42,417
When did cell phones
start to take off in Japan?

288
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,250
Around 1996, it looks like.

289
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,917
Ones with e-mail capabilities
might've been even later.

290
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:53,917
In other words,
Urushibara-<i>san</i>'s mother

291
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:57,375
might not have had a
cell phone when he was born.

292
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,833
Then we can't send a D-mail?

293
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,292
Oh, no...

294
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:04,292
Maybe we could hack the microwave
to send psycho-waves instead?

295
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:06,917
You two are all the psychos we need.

296
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:12,292
Yes...! That's it...! Abuse me more!

297
00:19:12,292 --> 00:19:14,083
I got it...

298
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:18,125
My genius frightens me!

299
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,167
I'm afraid to ask...

300
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:23,958
If cell phones are out, then
let's just send it to a pager!

301
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:28,875
Pagers were miniature receivers
that signals could be sent to via phone.

302
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:32,333
They enjoyed widespread use in the 1990s,

303
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,333
but their popularity waned
after cell phones were introduced.

304
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,292
--Pagers?
--I've never seen one before!

305
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:41,375
You sure know a lot. You're more
like "Celeb 30" than "Celeb 17."

306
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,375
It's written right there. Read for yourself.

307
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,500
Lab Member 006, Urushibara Ruka!

308
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,167
This is your first mission.

309
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:55,042
Find out if your mother had
a pager and obtain its number!

310
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:56,750
R-Right!

311
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:01,833
My mother had a pager!

312
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,750
--This is the number!
--Excellent!

313
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,125
You decided on the message too, I hope?

314
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:07,875
Yes!

315
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:11,500
"Eat vegetables for a healthy baby."

316
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,083
I heard you can only send
18 <i>hiragana </i>characters, so...

317
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,917
You can only send
numbers to pagers, though.

318
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,917
We'll have to convert this into numbers...

319
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:22,250
Just a sec.

320
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,292
It looks like voiced consonant
marks need two numbers.

321
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:26,167
Huh?

322
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:29,542
We can send 36 half-width
Japanese characters at most.

323
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:31,750
That makes this message
four characters too long.

324
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,667
Hmm. In that case...

325
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:37,833
Converting this into numerical form, we get...

326
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,167
--Okay! We're gonna start it up!
--Right!

327
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,375
Are you sure about this?

328
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,458
Don't worry.

329
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:16,833
The Reading Steiner took effect! Meaning...!

330
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:17,917
...people like this too?

331
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:20,333
Yeah! It's cute!

332
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,250
I think it'd look
wonderful on you, Ruka-<i>chan</i>!

333
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,583
R-Really?

334
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:29,625
Is this...?

335
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:30,875
Hey, pervert!

336
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,333
Watch where you're staring!

337
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,833
N-No! It's not like that...!

338
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,083
Hold on!

339
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:41,000
I can't just up and ask
if Rukako's a girl now...

340
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,042
But...

341
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:46,750
I guess it failed...

342
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,000
Knock it off, will you?!

343
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,625
What kind of perverted thoughts
are you having, grinning like that?!

344
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,083
Sheesh, Okarin!

345
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:58,292
Honestly, now! You two
pervs never let up, do you?

346
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:01,417
I'm not a perv! I'm a perverted gentleman!

347
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:04,500
Whatever! Same difference!

348
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:09,792
But... the world line <i>did </i>change.

349
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:11,958
Something's changed.

350
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:15,208
