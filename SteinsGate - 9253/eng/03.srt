1
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:11,167
Makise Kurisu...!

2
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:13,208
I tried knocking, but...

3
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:15,208
H-How did you find this place?

4
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:17,167
I asked Hashida-<i>san</i>.

5
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:21,125
He called it a laboratory, so
I expected something a little more proper--

6
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,292
Daru! Did you betray me?!

7
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:24,417
Huh?

8
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:27,208
You were taken in by this 3D girl's spell!

9
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:31,458
You'll pay for this! Indeed, you shall!

10
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:34,000
You bitch!

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,083
Could you do something about him?

12
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,958
Just think of it as situational confusion.

13
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:40,958
Emergency situation.

14
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:44,250
The Organization has
finally sent an agent here.

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,833
What?! This is the
choice of Steins Gate as well?!

16
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,083
Steins Gate...?

17
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:52,833
One of his neurotic fantasies.
It doesn't really mean anything.

18
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:57,125
Hardly surprising. It's a
jumble of German <i>and </i>English.

19
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,625
No shoes.

20
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,417
Oh, I'm sorry!

21
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:03,708
I was in America for so long...

22
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:09,250
Allow me to reintroduce
myself. I'm Makise Kurisu.

23
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:16,625
You can't even shake my hand?
Japanese men have no sense of etiquette.

24
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:21,958
You're acting <i>too </i>afraid.

25
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes, it must be the aura
of bloodlust surrounding you.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,250
Is this what they call "martial arts"?

27
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:31,833
Where are you going?!

28
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:36,042
Actually, I came to see if you
really had witnessed me being stabbed

29
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:42,000
or if it was just an excuse
for sexually harassing me.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,583
But more importantly...

31
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:02,917
<i>For you, billions and billions of heartbeats</i>

32
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:09,583
<i>are nothing at all; just the blink of an eye</i>

33
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:14,792
<i>Although I'm trapped by</i>
<i>the past and lament the future</i>

34
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:20,708
<i>inevitability won't allow for</i>
<i>even a speck of a miscalculation</i>

35
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:26,833
<i>Our dreams and futures that</i>
<i>form and expand into "infinity"</i>

36
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:32,667
<i>allow us the right to be vain,</i>

37
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:38,917
<i>while the two hands</i>
<i>point out what is "finite"</i>

38
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:43,500
<i>All of which leads to a cruel</i>
<i>contract and choice to make</i>

39
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,750
<i>Hacking to the Gate</i>

40
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:52,667
<i>So, now, with each passing</i>
<i>second, I'll cross world lines</i>

41
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:57,583
<i>to protect that smile on your face</i>

42
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:04,583
<i>Then, once again, into a</i>
<i>time loop without sadness</i>

43
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:11,250
<i>I will be swallowed up as a lone observer</i>

44
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,250
Their attachment site is undamaged.

45
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,583
There's no trickery involved.

46
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,333
She may be planning to plant explosives.

47
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,792
Keep a sharp eye on her.

48
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:39,500
Get real...

49
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,750
--Have any tweezers?
--No.

50
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,542
Okay.

51
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:44,500
The inside's squishy.

52
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,167
It tastes like...

53
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:47,958
Nothing. Yuck!

54
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:51,333
You vile zombie! If you're hungry, just say so!

55
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,667
I can give you a banana!

56
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:56,583
No thanks. Who'd eat a
pervert's banana anyway?

57
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,625
Pervert?!

58
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,792
You started poking and groping
me the moment you met me.

59
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:03,500
--Miss Makise, Miss Makise.
--Yes?

60
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Could you say, "Who'd eat a
pervert's banana anyway?" again?

61
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,583
With a distressed look, if possible.

62
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,625
--Distressed?
--Yeah.

63
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:17,333
What are you blushing for?
Oh, did you imagine something?

64
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:21,833
Tell us, genius girl! What did
your gifted mind just envision?

65
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,958
Please, do tell!

66
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,750
It would appear that you're <i>both </i>perverts.

67
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,375
--You're too kind...
--That's not praise.

68
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:32,750
I'd say the one with the
perverted imagination is the pervert...

69
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,750
Perverted genius girl!

70
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,500
Who are you calling a pervert?!

71
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,333
Okay, I'll be frank.

72
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,875
I could easily sue you for
sexual harassment this very minute,

73
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,375
but I'll overlook it for now.

74
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,417
For now?

75
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,667
So give me the details.

76
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:49,042
This banana has something to
do with that microwave, correct?

77
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:50,583
That's top-secret!

78
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,667
Future Gadget #8, the Phone
Microwave (Temporary Name),

79
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:56,708
is our laboratory's secret weapon.

80
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:02,875
Actually, if anyone, Miss Makise might
be able to explain this crazy functionality.

81
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:03,875
But...

82
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:08,042
Seriously, we're never
gonna figure it out on our own.

83
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:11,833
But this is classified
Future Gadget Laboratory--

84
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,125
You! Christina, you said?

85
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,458
I never said that.

86
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,500
I'll tell you the secrets of the
Phone Microwave (Temporary Name),

87
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,833
but only on certain conditions!

88
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:30,167
First, you must become a member
of the Future Gadget Laboratory.

89
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:33,750
So you want me to join your lab?

90
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:38,958
But I'm returning to America in August.

91
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,833
Until then, then.

92
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,958
--Second...
--There's more?

93
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:48,042
You must forget about <i>all</i>
sexual harassment I have committed.

94
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:49,083
Those are my conditions!

95
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:53,125
You're petty, Okarin. Seriously petty...

96
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,875
That's what I love about ya!

97
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,000
Shut up!

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,250
--So? A good deal, wouldn't you say?
--For <i>you</i>, maybe.

99
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,708
Sheesh. You're causing me
to secrete excess noradrenaline.

100
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,042
What do you say, Christina?

101
00:06:07,042 --> 00:06:08,750
Don't call me that!

102
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,917
My bad, The Zombie!

103
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:13,708
Say it right, Hououin Pervert Kyouma!

104
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:17,000
Be quiet, pervert genius girl!

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,500
Two perverts staring
each other down! That's hot!

106
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,958
Shut up, pervert!

107
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:24,542
Oh, all right. Fine. I accept.

108
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:29,042
Just quit with the "pervert" stuff.
I'll quit treating you like one too.

109
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:30,292
Very well.

110
00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:34,333
Then, as of now, you are
officially Lab Member 004...

111
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,333
...Christina!

112
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,958
And don't call me that!

113
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:41,750
Juicy #1 Chicken Tenders! Wow!

114
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,625
--I'm back!
--It's a teleporter?

115
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,708
It's dangerous to jump
to conclusions, you know.

116
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,250
Then what do <i>you </i>think is it?

117
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,583
Well, it didn't teleport the chicken tenders...

118
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,917
--...or the banana bunch, right?
--One, two, three, four...

119
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:55,000
Oh? A visitor?

120
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,667
Hello. I'm Makise Kurisu.

121
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:02,167
I'm sorry for visiting unannounced.

122
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:03,875
I'm Shiina Mayuri.

123
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,958
It looks like I'm a lab member now too...

124
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,250
--A lab member?
--Yes.

125
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,708
A girl lab member!

126
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,375
I-Is it that rare?

127
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,333
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

128
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,833
You're the first girl member besides Mayushii!

129
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,250
Really?

130
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,083
Nice to meetcha!

131
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,667
--Yes! Likewise!
--What?!

132
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:27,667
What is it?

133
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,250
There was an electrical discharge!

134
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,250
Huh? Why didn't you mention it sooner?!

135
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,875
Give me all the details!

136
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,375
Huh? Well, uhh...

137
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,125
Lightning-ish stuff came
outta the microwave, and...

138
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,625
--When was this?
--Yesterday, around noon.

139
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:46,750
You'd rushed out after seeing
the news about the satellite crash,

140
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,333
so I hooked my own cell phone up to it.

141
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:55,042
So, wait, when I sent that e-mail,

142
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:58,750
your phone was connected to the
Phone Microwave (Temporary Name)?

143
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,792
The e-mail about Miss Makise getting stabbed?

144
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:03,292
That was last week, man.

145
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:06,625
No! I sent it at noon yesterday--!

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,625
Where is it?! Where is it?! Why isn't it here?!

147
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,375
What was the microwave doing
when the discharge occurred?

148
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,208
I was doing an operations test,

149
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:18,083
so I think it was spinning
in reverse at the time.

150
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,375
Sounds like we should try to recreate it.

151
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,375
Mayuri! Bring the Juicy #1 Chicken Tenders!

152
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,458
Okay!

153
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,875
Oh, do you all want some?
You can each have one!

154
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,375
Does something need to be inside?

155
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,875
I want to see what happens to an object inside

156
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,125
when it's spinning in reverse.

157
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,750
Daru.

158
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,542
Assistant. Send a message to my phone.

159
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:43,167
Since when am I your assistant?

160
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:45,625
Besides, I don't even know your e-mail address.

161
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,458
Lousy useless assistant.

162
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,667
Daru. Your phone will do.

163
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:52,042
--What should it say?
--Hmm...

164
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:53,875
"Christina is a pervert..."

165
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,917
I told you, that's not allowed.

166
00:08:55,917 --> 00:09:00,542
Then I'll meet you halfway
and go with, "Okarin is a pervert."

167
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:02,500
--Wha...?!
--Hashida-<i>san</i>! Good job!

168
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,542
Okay! Gonna send it now!

169
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:07,708
Now we wait for the message to arrive...

170
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:11,042
They should be ready about now!

171
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:12,583
Wait!

172
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:27,917
--You okay?!
--Yeah...

173
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:30,750
Ventilation! Ventilation!

174
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:37,083
What just happened?

175
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,958
Was it the EM waves?

176
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,875
Don't be stupid.

177
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:45,458
A microwave oven's EM waves
couldn't wreck a desk in such a short time.

178
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,583
Ahh! They're charred black!

179
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,167
I just bought 'em, too...

180
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:51,708
What about the hole in the floor?

181
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,917
Mr. Braun's totally gonna
freak when he sees it...

182
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,667
--Well?
--It's here...

183
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:07,042
Received July 24th, at 5:30 pm...

184
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:10,333
It really did go back in time...

185
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,833
--Have you figured something out?
--Yes! It all connects!

186
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:19,875
Now I see! The one answer
that connects this string of events!

187
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,958
Really?

188
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:25,167
The banana returned to
the bunch it was torn from!

189
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,750
And this e-mail traveled
five days into the past!

190
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,750
No, you don't mean...

191
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,292
Indeed, I do!

192
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:33,875
This Phone Microwave (Temporary Name) is...

193
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,792
...a time machine!

194
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,958
Thirteen messages...?

195
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,583
From "S. F."...

196
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:02,458
Oh, right. That girl I named "Shining Finger."

197
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,542
Man, look at all these...

198
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:06,917
"E-mail me right away."

199
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,833
"Are you asleep?"

200
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,458
"How long are you gonna sleep?"

201
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,083
Daru...

202
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,250
Wanna go for a walk?

203
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,167
--What's wrong?
--Critical damage...

204
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:24,500
We worked all through the night for nothin'...

205
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,875
I regret even trying.

206
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:30,042
Why aren't they turning
into gel-nanas anymore?

207
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:33,500
Beats me.

208
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,333
That was the only time we
managed to send an e-mail, too.

209
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,542
Maybe we should ask Miss Makise back here?

210
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:41,708
You know that's not gonna happen.

211
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:45,542
No way... A time machine...?!

212
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,125
And then she never came back.

213
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,083
What was her deal?

214
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,792
What's this?

215
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:56,667
The LHC.

216
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:57,667
Huh?

217
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:01,750
The Large Hadron Collider.
SERN's particle accelerator.

218
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,500
It's such a soothing sight...

219
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:14,375
SERN maintains a strict monopoly
on the time machine market.

220
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,125
John Titor...

221
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,708
Oh, that guy you mentioned before?

222
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,458
@channel's going crazy over him now.

223
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,125
What's SERN?!

224
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:29,000
Titor said that SERN
completes a time machine by 2034!

225
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,542
You're making no sense...

226
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:32,958
Just tell me! What's SERN--?!

227
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,000
Cut it out!

228
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,625
It's the acronym for the European
Organization in Nuclear Research.

229
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,000
It's based just outside Geneva.

230
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,792
As its name suggests, it focuses
mainly on particle physics research.

231
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:47,458
It boasts some of the
finest facilities in the world too,

232
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,125
including the Low Energy Antiproton Ring,

233
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,208
the Proton Synchrotron Booster,

234
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,250
the Large Electron-Positron Collider,

235
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,333
and the last boss...

236
00:12:56,333 --> 00:13:01,583
...the world's biggest particle
accelerator: Large Hadron Collider-<i>tan</i>!

237
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:10,625
There were even rumors that the
LHC could produce mini-black holes.

238
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,417
Black holes...

239
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:16,542
--Daru.
--Yeah?

240
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:20,583
Doesn't one theory suggest
that time travel is possible

241
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:24,125
through the use of mini-black holes?

242
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:29,333
Yeah, but you heard
Miss Makise's lecture, remember?

243
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,792
She said it's impossible to
generate black holes to begin with.

244
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:36,292
But with the LHC, it's possible--

245
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:38,708
Good point! Not.

246
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,583
SERN publicly denied it.

247
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:44,542
But where there's smoke there's fire.

248
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:46,167
It's me.

249
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:47,917
Yes. I know.

250
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:50,583
El Psy Congroo.

251
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,833
Who exactly are you battling?

252
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,250
At this juncture, we've
but one course of action.

253
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,833
Go visit Faris-<i>tan</i>!

254
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,875
No! You're a super hax0r, right?!

255
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,750
Just grin and go along with everything I say!

256
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,875
It's "hacker," not "hax0r." Get it right.

257
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:08,000
--You know your next task, right?
--Not a clue.

258
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,625
Hack into SERN.

259
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,500
That is all.

260
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,417
Okarin... You're joking, right?

261
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:22,417
Unveil their evildoing and
find out about their time machine.

262
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:26,250
Your skills will determine whether
the Phone Microwave (Temporary Name)

263
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,458
becomes a usable time machine or
ends up in the back of our lab's closet.

264
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,375
Don't blame me for whatever happens!

265
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:35,333
Two beef bowls. That'll be 800 yen total.

266
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,792
Okarin!

267
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:42,000
Slacking off again?

268
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,375
Uh-huh.

269
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,417
There's nothing to do
at the shop. It's so boring.

270
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:49,375
You're more like a bicycle shop now.

271
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:53,542
Say, what are you guys up to upstairs?

272
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:55,833
It's called the Future Gadget Laboratory, right?

273
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,833
H-How do you know that name?!

274
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,708
Very well, then. If you know that much...

275
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:09,042
We're battling a secret organization
that controls the world from the shadows.

276
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:13,292
In fact, we're just about to
launch a hacking offensive against it.

277
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:18,083
Oh, then is "SERN" that secret organization?

278
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,167
How do you know that?!

279
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:23,833
I'm sorry. I heard you guys talking up there...

280
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,000
Like I said, it gets really boring. So I just--

281
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,833
You were spying on us?!

282
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,750
I can't help that I can hear you.

283
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:35,000
But don't worry! I'm great at keeping secrets!

284
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:37,958
Not again.

285
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,333
What is it? A death report?

286
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,458
A what?!

287
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,500
O-Oh, I'm just kidding...

288
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,250
It's just this girl with a rabid obsession

289
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,708
with some retro PC called an IBN 5100...

290
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:50,917
An IBN?

291
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:53,500
You've heard of it?!

292
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,625
Y-Yeah...

293
00:15:55,625 --> 00:16:00,708
--You overheard that too?
--No, no! I saw it online!

294
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:05,083
You know, that time
traveler guy. John Titor, was it?

295
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,125
Titor?!

296
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:09,125
I read about it on @channel.

297
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:14,500
The IBN 5100 was built
before PCs could run BASIC,

298
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,000
so it can read IBN's proprietary
programming language or something--

299
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,083
--Really?!
--Y-Yeah...

300
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,917
Come to think of it, the Titor
who appeared in 2000 also said...

301
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:35,167
You all seem to have fixed
views about the concept of time.

302
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:41,375
Time is not like a single
river flowing from past to future.

303
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:48,208
For example, let's say I go back in
time and kill someone we'll call "A."

304
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:52,250
Doing so will change what is
known as the "divergence number"

305
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:57,917
and the world line will
move to a world without A.

306
00:16:57,917 --> 00:17:02,583
When a world line moves,
people's memories are reconstructed.

307
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:07,708
In other words, memories of the
world in which A existed are erased

308
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:14,500
and replaced with memories of
a world line where A doesn't exist.

309
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,042
I've been wanting to know for a while now--

310
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:19,958
how exactly does SERN, a research organization,

311
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:23,042
wind up as an administrative
body that rules the world?

312
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,667
Do not take SERN's word at face value.

313
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:31,833
They have already succeeded
in producing micro black holes.

314
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,958
Perhaps the easiest way to
describe this dystopia would be to call it

315
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:40,292
a revival of communism with
18th-century living standards.

316
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:46,333
In 2036, SERN possesses most of
the world's science and technology.

317
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:51,417
And you need an IBN 5100
to alter this future of yours?

318
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:53,417
Correct.

319
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:59,750
The IBN 5100's abilities are
needed to halt SERN's plans.

320
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,542
As I recall, the John Titor who
appeared in 2000 said something similar...

321
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,500
The "me" who appeared ten years ago?

322
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:13,208
As I said before, I've unfortunately
never been to the year 2000.

323
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:18,042
However, it's possible you
saw me in another world line.

324
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:23,625
I'm intrigued. I'd very much
like to talk with you sometime.

325
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:29,042
This is my e-mail address.
If you contact me, I'll reply.

326
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,042
Almost there...

327
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:39,167
If I can just get ahold of the SQL table list...

328
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:43,333
--...grabbing the password will be a cinch.
--Too-too-roo! Good morning!

329
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,417
Oh, Mayuri.

330
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,167
What brings you here so early?

331
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:52,292
I heard you pulled two all-nighters
in a row, so I brought some stuff!

332
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:54,542
Tadah!

333
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:55,833
Canned <i>oden </i>stew!

334
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,583
Many thanks! Continue to bring more, Mayuri!

335
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:04,000
Mayushii doesn't have enough
pocket money to treat you all the time.

336
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,458
I need to buy Rai-Net sausages too, after all!

337
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:08,750
More Oopas, huh?

338
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,042
So I hope you'll savor and enjoy this!

339
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:15,917
There's some for Daru-<i>kun </i>and Kurisu-<i>chan </i>too!

340
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:17,708
No, not there!

341
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,542
He doesn't hear me at all.

342
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,583
I keep telling him to take a break.

343
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:26,167
His super hax0r soul is burning brightly!

344
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:28,167
It's not "hax0r"!

345
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:34,375
It isn't nice to pry into
others' business, you know.

346
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,958
It's to expose SERN's plot.

347
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,542
Still...

348
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:43,625
I think Kurisu-<i>chan </i>ran out
because she was mad about it.

349
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:48,083
No, she left on her own,
not because of the hacking.

350
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:51,833
I hope she'll come back...

351
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,583
Huh? What?

352
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,667
I'll trade a fishcake for a beef strip.

353
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:02,542
Oh? Then I'd rather have a quail patty.

354
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:06,208
Nope. Quail patties are my
second favorite, after beef strips.

355
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,833
Mayushii likes them too, though.

356
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,583
Then take a fish tube instead.

357
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:15,417
--I <i>guess </i>that's better than a fishcake...
--Excellent. We have a deal.

358
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:17,750
Then here's Mayushii's beef strip--

359
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,167
--Huh?
--Already took it.

360
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:22,000
Huh?! When did you...?

361
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,208
Pretty good.

362
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:31,792
Got it!

363
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:34,042
I got it! I got it! I got it!

364
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:38,250
Now give it up and reveal everything to me!

365
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,958
--Yes! Got an ID!
--You're in?!

366
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,417
Mission complete!

367
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:46,667
You're amazing! Even if
I don't understand why...

368
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:48,667
Well, I did hack our way in,

369
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:52,500
but there's only so much we
can see without an admin ID...

370
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,000
Like only getting to see a character's boobs!

371
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,542
You're so naughty, Daru-<i>kun</i>.

372
00:20:56,542 --> 00:21:01,375
--So what did you find?!
--Just a few e-mails so far.

373
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,292
English?! Let's consult Dr. Excite for help!

374
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:07,125
Forget that! Too annoying!

375
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,375
Translated, it says, "Hi, Paul!"

376
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:12,417
--The acting is unnecessary.
--Aww.

377
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:13,625
Let's see...

378
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:16,042
"The LHC is working well.

379
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:18,500
It's as fickle as a cat,

380
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,542
but things have been going
surprisingly well this past month."

381
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:24,208
--What does that mean?
--You got me.

382
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:27,917
Never mind that! Are there
any mentions of a time machine?!

383
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:31,083
The phrase "time machine" doesn't show up,

384
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:35,875
but the term "Z-Program" was used
about 100 times in the past month.

385
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:36,833
Let's see here...

386
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:42,500
"Z-Program Experiment Report 137..."

387
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:47,292
"As the aim of generating mini-black
holes has already been established,

388
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:50,333
that report is omitted."

389
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,833
Mini-black holes...

390
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:52,958
Seems so!

391
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:56,542
They publicly announced those
experiments were a failure, though!

392
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:57,958
What's after that?!

393
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,833
"Experimental result..."

394
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:07,458
"Human is dead. Mismatch."

395
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,833
Human is dead?

396
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,500
Yeah...

397
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,958
Someone...

398
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,625
...died?

399
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:35,042

400
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:43,792

00:23:35,167 --> 00:24:02,070
