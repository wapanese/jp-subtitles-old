00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:13,250
Yesterday, after I came
back from Mr. Braun's house...

2
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,458
...nothing ended up happening.

3
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:23,750
Moeka and her thugs always
appeared on Friday the 13th.

4
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:32,542
Did telling myself to stop following
Suzuha change the world line?

5
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:35,958
If so...

6
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:39,458
...will Mayuri remain alive now,
without anything else happening?

7
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,750
Huh?

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,042
Mayushii's watch has stopped...

9
00:00:46,042 --> 00:00:47,708
That's strange.

10
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:51,083
I wound it up just a little while ago...

11
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:11,875
<i>For you, billions and billions of heartbeats</i>

12
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:18,542
<i>are nothing at all; just the blink of an eye</i>

13
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:23,750
<i>Although I'm trapped by</i>
<i>the past and lament the future</i>

14
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:29,667
<i>inevitability won't allow for</i>
<i>even a speck of a miscalculation</i>

15
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:35,792
<i>Our dreams and futures that</i>
<i>form and expand into "infinity"</i>

16
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:41,625
<i>allow us the right to be vain,</i>

17
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:47,833
<i>while the two hands</i>
<i>point out what is "finite"</i>

18
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:52,458
<i>All of which leads to a cruel</i>
<i>contract and choice to make</i>

19
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,708
<i>Hacking to the Gate</i>

20
00:01:54,708 --> 00:02:01,625
<i>So, now, with each passing</i>
<i>second, I'll cross world lines</i>

21
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:06,542
<i>to protect that smile on your face</i>

22
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:13,542
<i>Then, once again, into a</i>
<i>time loop without sadness</i>

23
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:20,208
<i>I will be swallowed up as a lone observer</i>

24
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:36,083
What's going on? What's this about?

25
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,958
Help me...

26
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:42,375
Mayuri dies two hours from now?

27
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:51,208
Wait, so you've time-leapt
over and over trying to stop it?

28
00:02:52,917 --> 00:02:54,750
It must've been hard on you...

29
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:00,625
According to Amane-<i>san</i>, we can save Mayuri

30
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:08,000
by moving from this alpha
attractor field to a beta world line.

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,208
For that, we need to use an IBN 5100

32
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:15,875
to erase the data SERN has about you guys.

33
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:20,125
But the IBN 5100 that's supposed
to be at the Yanabayashi Shrine

34
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,833
disappeared when the world lines changed.

35
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:27,375
Only a few D-mails we
sent changed the world line:

36
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:31,708
the Loto 6 one, Kiryu-<i>san</i>'s,
Urushibara-<i>san</i>'s, Faris-<i>san</i>'s,

37
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,542
and the one about following Amane-<i>san.</i>

38
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:39,625
Undoing the one about tailing
Amane-<i>san </i>delayed the raid by a day.

39
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:43,708
So maybe if you undo
each D-mail in reverse order,

40
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:49,125
you can return to the original
world line where the IBN 5100 is there?

41
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:55,333
It's only a hypothesis, though.
There's no scientific basis for it...

42
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,917
Even so...!

43
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:02,458
If there's a chance, then...

44
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:09,000
I know it was my idea and all,
but undoing all those D-mails...

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,042
Yeah. It'll be pretty tough work.

46
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:15,417
But it has to be done.

47
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:17,333
Be careful.

48
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:23,458
B-Because your brain is a valuable sample!

49
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,833
You retain memories even across world lines

50
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,333
<i>and </i>it's endured the time leap process!

51
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,625
--We need to map it--
--Thank you, Kurisu.

52
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:47,042
I'm going to forget you
called me "Kurisu," aren't I?

53
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,708
What?

54
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,917
Nothing.

55
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,917
Going in reverse order,
the next one to be undone...

56
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:11,208
...is Faris' D-mail.

57
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:17,875
Hello?!

58
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:21,458
Daru. Do you know where
Faris might be right now?!

59
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,250
Sure do!

60
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,000
Where?! Where is she?!

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,250
The UPX conference building!

62
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,083
The final match of the Rai-Net ABGC just ended!

63
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,083
ABGC?

64
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:37,083
WTF, dude! It's short for "Rai-Net
Access Battlers Grand Championship"!

65
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:40,458
It's like a competition between all
the Rai-Netters throughout Japan,

66
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,833
and it just ended with
Faris-<i>tan </i>as the winner!

67
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,958
I'm excited to the max!

68
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,625
After Faris sent her D-mail,

69
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:52,000
Akiba went back to being an electronics town.

70
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,458
I don't know what her message said.

71
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:58,667
Just who did she send
it to, and what did it say?!

72
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,083
Kyouma!

73
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,875
Faris! What's going on?!

74
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,875
Sir. The cat's with a guy in a lab coat.

75
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,667
<i>Don't </i>let her get away!

76
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:17,542
Not that she <i>can</i>, though.

77
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:22,833
For <i>no one </i>escapes from <i>my </i>dark force...

78
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,042
Who's chasing you?!

79
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:29,958
The Viral Attackers, meow.

80
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,833
Viral Attackers?

81
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:37,417
A bunch of no-good Rai-Netters
who'll do whatever it takes to win!

82
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:41,125
They ambushed Faris to get
even for beating them, meow!

83
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,708
--Ambushed--?!
--This way!

84
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,708
Where'd they go?

85
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,250
Gotta be around here somewhere.

86
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,875
Yeah.

87
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,875
That reminds me, you called earlier...

88
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,208
Oh, right!

89
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,458
I need to know what your D-mail said!

90
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,125
D-mail?

91
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,250
The e-mail you sent back in time!

92
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,958
Back in time? What are
you talking about, meow?

93
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:36,000
The Faris in this world line
doesn't know about D-mails...

94
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,500
O-Oh, err, I mean to say--

95
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,375
There they are!

96
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,167
Tell me, just hypothetically...

97
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:57,708
Would you believe me if
I said we built a time machine?!

98
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,833
--I'd believe anything you say, Kyouma!
--Really?!

99
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:04,708
Faris just developed an
interdimensional transporter herself!

100
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:10,208
Let's pretend Akiba was
a town full of <i>moe </i>culture!

101
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,833
Oh?

102
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:18,500
If you could use the time machine to
make it an electronics town like this,

103
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,750
how would you do it?!

104
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,208
What kind of logic game is this?

105
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,583
Please, just tell me!

106
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:29,875
I don't really know...

107
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:35,125
But a town full of <i>moe</i>
sounds like a lot of fun!

108
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:38,958
Actually, I once talked to my daddy

109
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,417
about maybe opening a maid café in Akiba.

110
00:08:43,417 --> 00:08:46,500
But he said no, sadly.

111
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,708
You mean May Queen?

112
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:53,083
How do you know that name?
I didn't even tell my daddy...

113
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,625
May Queen used to exist!

114
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:55,625
Here, in Akiba!

115
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,458
Akiba used to be full of <i>moe</i>!

116
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:00,958
Kyouma?

117
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,917
And you loved it more than anyone!

118
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:07,667
But the instant you sent your
D-mail, the entire city changed!

119
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:10,167
What message did you send?!

120
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:19,042
--Please! Tell me!
--I found 'em! Over here!

121
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,458
What is it?

122
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,750
This is it!

123
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,958
This is where May Queen was!
The café you wanted to start!

124
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,875
Meow...?

125
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:47,208
You worked here!

126
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,500
Mayuri, too!

127
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:53,000
Daru was a regular here!

128
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,708
This is where we met!

129
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,833
Welcome home, Master!

130
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,333
--Ice coffee, please.
--Certainly, meow!

131
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,292
We're about to start the daytime Faris Cup!

132
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:12,958
--Strategy Code... K.B.O.O.M.!
--"The World's in Danger" FTW!

133
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:18,583
So many masters visited
today! It sure was lively!

134
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:20,750
Faris!

135
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,583
I-I'm okay.

136
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,542
What happens if you don't undo the D-mail?

137
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:34,958
Mayuri's life will be in danger...

138
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:38,833
You're kidding, right?

139
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,250
You're kidding, right?!

140
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,417
What do you mean
Mayushii's life is in danger?!

141
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:46,042
Do you know what the D-mail said?!

142
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:47,542
Tell me! Please!

143
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:50,167
I have to undo the D-mail!

144
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:53,542
I can't.

145
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:55,292
Why not?!

146
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:59,167
Don't you care...
Don't you care if Mayuri dies?!

147
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:00,833
Of course I care!

148
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,583
--But...
--Faris!

149
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:10,167
My daddy died ten years ago.
I brought him back to life.

150
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:12,208
Huh?

151
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:18,208
I changed the past... so he wouldn't die!

152
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:39,750
Kyouma!

153
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,333
Kyouma...

154
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,292
Not so cool now, are ya, dude?!

155
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,708
Okay! Now you're
comin' with us, Princess!

156
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,042
Let go!

157
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:56,417
Kyouma!

158
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:59,292
Yes, the cat's in the bag.

159
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:02,333
--My badass aura's been itchin'...
--He'll be here soon.

160
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,125
--...to dye her black for a while now!
--Until then, we can enjoy...

161
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:09,917
Stop...

162
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:12,667
Oh ho ho!

163
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:13,750
Let her go...!

164
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,750
Kyouma!

165
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,792
C'mon, now, dude.

166
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:19,708
You <i>still </i>wanna act cool?

167
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,500
Stop! Please!

168
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,208
Stop!

169
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:32,042
--Shit!
--Run for it!

170
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,167
Daddy!

171
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:34,792
Oh!

172
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:38,708
Stop right there! What were you just doing?!

173
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:42,708
Prepare yourself! The great 4ºC has arrived!

174
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,750
Huh?! Who the hell are you shits?

175
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,750
Huh?!

176
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,125
The... police?

177
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,208
Wha...? I'm under arrest?

178
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,333
Thank goodness...

179
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:57,417
Oh, what a relief...

180
00:12:57,417 --> 00:13:00,167
Daddy...

181
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:02,000
Thank you.

182
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,708
I hurried over to celebrate
after I heard you won,

183
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:10,125
but you were nowhere to be found.

184
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:13,083
You wouldn't answer your phone
either, so I looked everywhere for you.

185
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:17,208
Okabe-<i>kun</i>. I don't know
how I can thank you enough...

186
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,750
Oh, no, I didn't do anything.

187
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:24,333
Had I gone to watch the tournament,
this might never have happened.

188
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,875
You had work, Daddy.
You couldn't help it, meow.

189
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,875
Rumiho...

190
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,833
An IBN 5100?

191
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:36,500
Yes. I heard you gave
away one you used to have...

192
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,208
Do you know where it is now?
Could you get it back?

193
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,667
Some things happened, you see,

194
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:46,542
and I had to break my
promise with Hashida-<i>san</i>.

195
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:48,167
Hashida-<i>san</i>...

196
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:50,458
Do you mean Hashida Suzu-<i>san</i>?!

197
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:51,875
Oh, you know her?

198
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:55,500
She's the one who gave me the IBN 5100.

199
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,250
I'll be okay.

200
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,917
I <i>will </i>get the IBN 5100, just you watch!

201
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:08,833
Suzuha... got it for us...

202
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,875
Daddy. You can tell him, meow.

203
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,292
But...

204
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:15,958
He did save my life and all!

205
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,792
Rumiho was kidnapped
a long time ago, you see...

206
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:26,583
My company wasn't as big as it is now,

207
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,917
so I couldn't come up
with the ransom money.

208
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:37,125
But then someone offered to buy
the IBN 5100 for a large sum of money.

209
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:40,458
So you got rid of it?

210
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:45,000
I was able to pay the
ransom with that money.

211
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,833
I've made it a personal rule ever since

212
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:50,333
to keep my promises with
my daughter, no matter what.

213
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:54,333
Even for the smallest
of things, no matter what...

214
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,958
Daddy!

215
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,792
My daddy died ten years ago.
I brought him back to life.

216
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:10,542
I changed the past so he wouldn't die!

217
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:17,875
If I undo the D-mail, he'll...

218
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,208
You're sending a D-mail, Okarin?!

219
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,625
It'll all disappear if you do that!

220
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:27,500
But if I don't, Mayuri, you'll--

221
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,917
Can I come in?

222
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:35,542
Yeah...

223
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,750
Faris...?

224
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,625
Umm, thanks for earlier.

225
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,625
It was really scary...

226
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:57,167
I've never run into so many
black-hearted people before.

227
00:15:57,167 --> 00:16:01,917
C-Come to think of it,
they <i>were </i>all dressed in black...

228
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:06,125
Oh, I'm trying to be serious here.

229
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,833
Sorry.

230
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,083
What's the matter, Faris?

231
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,792
Please call me Rumiho.

232
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:19,750
If you hadn't been there
Kyouma--no, Okabe-<i>san</i>--

233
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,458
I don't know <i>what </i>would've happened.

234
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:26,625
Don't correct yourself.
Just call me what you always do.

235
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:30,667
Anyway, I'm really grateful, Kyouma.

236
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:33,875
You're my prince.

237
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,125
P-Prince?!

238
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:42,667
I-I'm no prince!

239
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:44,042
I'm a mad...

240
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:46,542
Mayushii's life...

241
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:52,042
Is Mayushii's life really in danger?

242
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:53,833
Yeah.

243
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:57,583
Ten years ago, on my eighth birthday,

244
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:02,250
my daddy promised
to go have fun with me.

245
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:07,792
But he couldn't go, because of work.

246
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:12,000
It couldn't be helped, but I was so sad...

247
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,125
I thought maybe he didn't love me...

248
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:19,792
I said, "I don't care about you
anymore! I wish you would just die!"

249
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:21,583
And then...

250
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:26,375
...that ended up being the
last thing I ever said to him.

251
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,875
So I sent the D-mail to change that...

252
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:33,500
So your dad avoided the accident,

253
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,958
which kept you from spreading
<i>moe </i>culture throughout the city

254
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:42,375
and left Akiba as an electronics town...

255
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:47,417
I was so happy these ten years...

256
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:49,333
Far-- Rumiho...

257
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,875
I'll send a D-mail.

258
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,625
My daddy died in an accident ten years ago.

259
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,833
That's what really happened.

260
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,250
These past ten years have been a dream.

261
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:05,208
I got to spend more time with him
and learn how much he loved me.

262
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,125
But Mayushii's my friend.

263
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:11,833
I can't be selfish at a time like this.

264
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,708
Are you really okay with this?

265
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,125
No...

266
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,583
It's not okay...!

267
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:27,375
I remember what happened
before the world line changed.

268
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:31,500
But I also remember what
happened after it changed!

269
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:37,208
It's all mixed up in my head now...

270
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:41,792
I almost can't tell what's real anymore!

271
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,333
There might still be a way!

272
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:54,333
--Yeah! I'll consult with Kurisu again--
--No! I don't want to burden you anymore!

273
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:58,125
You're my prince and all!

274
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:02,625
It's time for me to wake up from this dream.

275
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:06,292
But I have one thing to ask...

276
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:15,625
Can I cry, just for a little bit?

277
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,458
Yeah...

278
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:35,833
So, did Faris-<i>san</i>...?

279
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:39,500
Yeah. She came to terms with it.

280
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,000
Get everything ready.

281
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,208
Here I am, meow!

282
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,417
Huh? What's the matter, Kyouma?

283
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:49,542
You're looking glum!

284
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,458
By the way...

285
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:05,667
When the world goes back to normal,
will I lose all my memories of this?

286
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:11,208
You have memories right now from
before and after the change, right?

287
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,000
So I'm sure you'll remember!

288
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,625
Thank goodness...

289
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:21,958
Faris doesn't want to forget the
time she shared with Kyouma...

290
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,667
Thank you.

291
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,167
It's on, Okabe!

292
00:20:30,792 --> 00:20:33,750
Bye-bye, Daddy...

293
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:51,000
Kyouma!

294
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,750
Have you seen Faris' cell phone?

295
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,292
--Faris...
--Mayushii hasn't seen it...

296
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:59,417
...so that just leaves you, meow.

297
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:01,958
Wha...?!

298
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,417
Kyouma! Did you look at you-know-what?!

299
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:09,583
If so, forget what you saw! It needs
to be sealed away forever, meow!

300
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,333
Come on, Kyouma!

301
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,958
You're supposed to answer back with,

302
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,917
"What do you mean by 'you-know-what'?"

303
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:16,917
Y'know?!

304
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:18,792
Faris!

305
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:20,167
Hey, stop that, you!

306
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:22,125
Quit grabbing her!

307
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:26,750
--Planning another perverted act, are you?!
--You're so daring, Okarin!

308
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,750
Kyouma and Faris fought a great darkness

309
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,458
and loved each other in a previous life!

310
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,750
They have a <i>deep </i>connection!

311
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,250
--Huh?!
--You sure fight lots of people!

312
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:41,208
Don't tell me you're as
out-there as Okabe, Faris-<i>san</i>...?

313
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,500
I'm sorry...

314
00:21:56,583 --> 00:22:02,083
The IBN 5100 <i>wasn't </i>at Yanabayashi Shrine...

315
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:05,667
Faris <i>did </i>store it there ten years ago

316
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:08,750
and it was there until last year, but...

317
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:16,375
Where in the world could it have gone?

318
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:35,167
<i>With my vision restricted, there's no escape</i>

319
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:43,917
<i>from the merciless control of the twelve</i>

320
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:52,792
<i>Wishing for a tomorrow of repose,</i>

321
00:22:52,792 --> 00:23:01,500
<i>I embark for the horizon of the</i>
<i>sacred phenomenon in my hand</i>

322
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:10,125
<i>Trapped by the covenant and</i>

323
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:19,250
<i>the heaven and earth of</i>

324
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:28,125
<i>Flutter, butterfly, oh, miraculous</i>

325
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:35,292
<i>Oh, butterfly of tears,</i>
<i>dazzling butterfly! It's all...</i>

326
00:23:35,292 --> 00:24:02,070
<i>...about to be rewritten now</i>
