1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,625
The universe has a beginning, but no end.

2
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:17,250
Infinite.

3
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:26,292
Stars have beginnings too, but
meet an end of their own making.

4
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:27,917
Finite.

5
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:36,042
History has shown that those with
wisdom are the greatest fools of all.

6
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:44,167
This could be considered God's
final warning to those who resist.

7
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,917
Okarin.

8
00:00:56,292 --> 00:00:57,917
Let's go.

9
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:24,500
Now infiltrating conference
venue. El Psy Congroo.

10
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:34,167
Attendance is low. Must be
due to Organization interference...

11
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:36,375
What's about to start?

12
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:39,542
You came here without knowing that?

13
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:46,042
Oh, a time machine! Wow!

14
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:50,125
Dr. Nakabachi has beaten
us researchers to the punch

15
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:54,125
and is holding a talk about
his "invention of the century."

16
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:57,792
I want to hear <i>all </i>about it.

17
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,375
An earthquake?

18
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,292
No, it's from above!

19
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,958
What's this?

20
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:31,792
You called me here for <i>this</i>?

21
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:34,375
There aren't many in this series left,

22
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:39,042
but Mayushii's out of 100-yen coins...

23
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:41,208
Don't act so spoiled, Mayuri.

24
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:44,250
Even if we are childhood friends,
I'm not lending you money.

25
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,583
Aww...

26
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:51,083
Allow me to show you
the harsh realities of life.

27
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:01,375
What the...? This one's unpainted.

28
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:04,167
--A m-metal one!
--Huh?

29
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:07,083
It's a metal one! A Metal Oopa!

30
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,250
Is it rare?

31
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,625
Yeah! <i>Really </i>rare!

32
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:17,500
Then you may have it.

33
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,250
Are you sure, Okarin?

34
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,917
It's "Hououin Kyouma."

35
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:22,833
Thanks, Okarin!

36
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,375
I told you, it's "Hououin Kyouma"...

37
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:31,083
Dr. Nakabachi's conference is
about to begin in the 8th floor hall.

38
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,833
Please enter freely...

39
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:42,917
You'll find the basic structure of a time
machine on the materials I've passed out.

40
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:46,833
As such, I'll use this time to explain
the fundamental theory behind it.

41
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:49,958
Scientists around the world have...

42
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:53,750
"I think I dropped my Metal Oopa.
I'm going to look for it."

43
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,333
Currently, there exist over ten main theories...

44
00:03:56,333 --> 00:04:03,292
--The basic structure of a time machine...
--...of time travel and its possible framework.

45
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:05,708
Very briefly, these theories are...

46
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,375
Doctor!

47
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,875
Oh, is something the matter?

48
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,667
Don't give me that! Your time
machine theory is what's the matter!

49
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:16,250
Kerr black holes! World lines!

50
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,750
All you've done is rip off John Titor's story!

51
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,583
Titor, a self-proclaimed time traveler,

52
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,500
posted this very same
theory on the Internet in 2000!

53
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,292
Don't feign ignorance!

54
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:29,875
How rude! Of course I'm aware!

55
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:33,250
Don't compare my
theory with that hogwash!

56
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,917
Then please kindly explain

57
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:40,417
how your time machine theory
is any different from Titor's!

58
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:43,875
Come here a minute.

59
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,583
H-Hey...!

60
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,958
Titor, huh...

61
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:50,583
Come to think of it, John Titor's
book <i>did </i>say the same sort of stuff...

62
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,667
Who are you?!

63
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:56,750
That's <i>my </i>line.

64
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,000
What?

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,333
You tried to tell me something earlier.

66
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,542
Earlier?

67
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:06,292
About fifteen minutes ago.

68
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:09,208
That's crazy talk--

69
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,542
Makise Kurisu...?

70
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:15,208
You published that paper in <i>Sciency</i>...

71
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:19,417
I'm impressed. Do you work
at a university lab or some--?

72
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:20,917
Curse you!

73
00:05:20,917 --> 00:05:23,833
Don't tell me you're an
agent sent by the Organization!

74
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,500
What organization?

75
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,292
--I just want to ask you a--
--And I've no reason to answer!

76
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:33,167
It's me. I've been caught
by one of their agents.

77
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:37,125
--Yes. Makise Kurisu. No, there's no problem.
--Who are you talking to?

78
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,958
I'll give her the slip somehow--

79
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,708
Huh? It's off...

80
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,708
I-I'll let you in on the secret.

81
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,708
That's actually a cell
phone for special missions.

82
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:55,917
It automatically shuts off
whenever anyone but me touches it.

83
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,042
Ah. You were talking to yourself.

84
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:02,833
I'll keep it short.

85
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,917
What did you try to tell me earlier?

86
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:10,375
You tried to tell me something
fifteen minutes ago, remember?

87
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,583
You had a very distressed look on your face...

88
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,542
I-I see right through your tricks.

89
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:23,333
When next we meet, genius
girl, we shall be adversaries.

90
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,750
--Huh?
--Farewell.

91
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,375
Wait...!

92
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:39,083
What was <i>that </i>about? She said she met me...

93
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:54,125
Oh!

94
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,250
Okarin!

95
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,833
Mayuri! Where were you?

96
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:01,708
I messaged you. I can't find my Metal Oopa.

97
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,250
I even wrote my name on it, too...

98
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,542
--Did you drop it somewhere?
--I think so.

99
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:09,042
--Forget about it.
--Huh?!

100
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:13,125
Metal Oopas go for
10,000 yen on online auctions!

101
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,167
10,000...?!

102
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:16,792
Yeah...

103
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:23,625
Find it! Our lab is almost
as broke as an old drum!

104
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,583
Huh? I'm not going to sell it, though.

105
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:32,083
With 10,000, we can procure all
kinds of parts for our Future Gadgets!

106
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,167
I'm not going to sell it...

107
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:42,750
Was that...?

108
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,667
Get outside!

109
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,292
Hey.

110
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,125
Is someone there...?

111
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:20,458
Makise... Kurisu...

112
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,250
--What the...?
--What happened?

113
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:48,042
Okarin!

114
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:55,667
What's wrong? You look really pale...

115
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:58,500
Someone died...

116
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,583
--Huh?
--On the 8th floor...

117
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:37,833
Wh-What the...?

118
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:58,458
What's going on?

119
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,500
Too-too-roo!

120
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Here, Okarin!

121
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:07,958
Wh-What's happening here...?!

122
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,500
Huh? What do you mean?

123
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,833
--Why did... everyone just disappear?!
--Disappear?

124
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:16,167
Yes! Everyone here suddenly
vanished right in front of us!

125
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,333
--They did?
--Don't give me that!

126
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,750
You saw it too!

127
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,792
--Right?! Right?!
--No...

128
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:25,083
What are you saying?!

129
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:59,000
<i>For you, billions and billions of heartbeats</i>

130
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,667
<i>are nothing at all; just the blink of an eye</i>

131
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:10,875
<i>Although I'm trapped by</i>
<i>the past and lament the future</i>

132
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:16,792
<i>inevitability won't allow for</i>
<i>even a speck of a miscalculation</i>

133
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:22,917
<i>Our dreams and futures that</i>
<i>form and expand into "infinity"</i>

134
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:28,750
<i>allow us the right to be vain,</i>

135
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:34,958
<i>while the two hands</i>
<i>point out what is "finite"</i>

136
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:39,583
<i>All of which leads to a cruel</i>
<i>contract and choice to make</i>

137
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,833
<i>Hacking to the Gate</i>

138
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:48,750
<i>So, now, with each passing</i>
<i>second, I'll cross world lines</i>

139
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,667
<i>to protect that smile on your face</i>

140
00:11:53,667 --> 00:12:00,667
<i>Then, once again, into a</i>
<i>time loop without sadness</i>

141
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:07,333
<i>I will be swallowed up as a lone observer</i>

142
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,708
Hey, you there!

143
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,208
Can you see us?

144
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,000
Why won't you answer?

145
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,917
I'm talking to you, the stupid-face
on the other side of the screen!

146
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:25,458
No matter. This is the
Future Gadget Laboratory.

147
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,750
Allow me to introduce our research staff.

148
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:34,083
First is Lab Member 001, the
lab founder and mad scientist:

149
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,875
yours truly, Hououin Kyouma.

150
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,375
"Okarin" is much cuter, though...

151
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:43,500
Silence! Okabe Rintaro is my cover name.

152
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,708
Next is Lab Member 002,

153
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:49,583
the cosplay costume creator and
our only female member: Shiina Mayuri.

154
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:53,083
Too-too-roo! Call me Mayushii!

155
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:57,125
Last is Lab Member 003:

156
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,833
Hashida Itaru, the super hax0r!

157
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,667
"Hacker," not "hax0r," n00b.

158
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:04,292
That's our staff.

159
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:08,167
Y'know, isn't it time you give up on it?

160
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:11,875
You can't expect much from
a 500-yen bargain bin game.

161
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,333
Listen well!

162
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,917
To get to our lab, go down Chuo-dori,

163
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:19,333
hang a left at the Suehirocho Station
intersection onto Kuramae-dori,

164
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:23,458
then find the multi-use building in
the alley just before the next light.

165
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,667
The goal of the Future Gadget Laboratory

166
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:28,875
is to transform the world's ruling structure...

167
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,792
To produce inventions that cause chaos.

168
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:33,083
Do you understand?

169
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:36,208
In that case, reveal your secrets this instant!

170
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:42,208
Say, do you think maybe <i>we</i>
seem like a game to Alpacaman?

171
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,625
I don't think he's even capable of grasping

172
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,625
the concepts of "games" and "reality."

173
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:50,500
So is that true for the 2D girls you like too?

174
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,917
They're different. They're my wives.

175
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,667
No one cares about your wives, Daru.

176
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:59,667
Still, it's an interesting idea, y'know.

177
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:06,375
If we <i>were </i>inside someone's screen,
would we ever be able to know?

178
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,292
--No.
--That was fast!

179
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:11,375
Consequently, such discussions are pointless.

180
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,667
It'd be far more productive to brainstorm ways

181
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:17,625
to oppose the Organization and
shatter the world's ruling structure.

182
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:21,625
Ugh, <i>again </i>with those delusions? Lame!

183
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,583
Hold thy tongue, super hax0r!

184
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:27,667
You're speaking to the mad scientist Hououin...

185
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,125
...Kyouma!

186
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,583
That's your made-up character.

187
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:39,333
Come now, Daru. I'd listen carefully
to what others say if I were you.

188
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:43,417
Oh, is this today's "You're
in no position to talk" thread?

189
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:46,833
Oh, looks like the press chopper's arrived.

190
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:50,833
At approximately noon today, an
object believed to be a space satellite

191
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,083
came crashing down in Akihabara.

192
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,958
As you can see, even from the ground...

193
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:59,583
What happened back there?

194
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,958
This morning, Mayuri and I left the lab

195
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:07,125
and headed to the Radio Building
to catch Dr. Nakabachi's conference.

196
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:12,167
But before I knew it,
a satellite had crashed into it...

197
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:13,708
And that's not all.

198
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,792
--<i>I </i>did?
--Yeah.

199
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:21,042
We saw the crash on TV, and you said,

200
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:24,667
"So the Organization
has finally made its move!"

201
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,542
And then we came here.

202
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:27,750
Canceled?!

203
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,750
You were all ticked-off this morning,

204
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,000
saying how the doc got
cold feet and called it off.

205
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,167
Dr. Nakabachi's talk?! But it
started at noon at the Radio Building!

206
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,958
Seriously, it was canceled.

207
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:45,625
Good thing, too. You would've
been a satellite pancake otherwise.

208
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,833
This inconsistency in my memories...

209
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:51,458
Has the Organization
manipulated my memory?

210
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,417
Oh! That's it!

211
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:56,708
This must be the choice of Steins Gate!

212
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,875
More role-playing?

213
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:04,875
That "Stein" thing of yours makes no sense.

214
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,333
Daru! Future Gadget #1!

215
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,875
You made Alpacaman mad.

216
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,250
--Because you changed the channel.
--Here.

217
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,542
Damn Mr. Braun! Forcing
this shoddy junk on us...!

218
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:23,583
He gave it to us for free.

219
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:27,292
--Daru! Carry the TV!
--GTFO.

220
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:29,167
It's hot out.

221
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:33,000
Besides, don't assume
I'm strong just 'cause I'm fat!

222
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,792
That's not a badge of honor!

223
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:40,583
Mr. Braun...!

224
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:44,083
Huh? I keep telling you, call me Tennoji<i>-san</i>.

225
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,667
I would like you to
repair this... immediately...

226
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:51,625
Huh? You busted it already?

227
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,417
Damn, you got no love for CRTs.

228
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:56,167
It'll cost ya 1000 yen.

229
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:57,167
Wha...?!

230
00:16:57,167 --> 00:16:59,708
If anyone's at fault here, it's you for--

231
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,292
Is that any way to talk to your landlord?

232
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:04,167
I will happily pay your fee.

233
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:07,625
I'd quit hangin' around with
this guy if I were you, Mayuri-<i>chan</i>.

234
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:11,167
Mayushii is Okarin's hostage, though.

235
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,833
Hostage, indeed...

236
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:17,417
Hmm? It's broken <i>here</i>,
too? Make it 2000 yen.

237
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:19,958
--Wha...?!
--Take it or leave it.

238
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:22,375
What's it gonna be?

239
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,792
It's me.

240
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:31,792
It appears the Organization has
gotten to that chrome-dome as well.

241
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:33,625
Sabotage is afoot...

242
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,250
Here you go.

243
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:41,875
You sure love Dk Pepper, Okarin.

244
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:48,458
It's the intelligent
drink of choice individuals.

245
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,000
The sound of the cicadas is amazing...

246
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:08,083
Daru!

247
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:11,542
Now that the Organization has
used Mr. Braun to sabotage us,

248
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:15,083
we've no choice but to set the
you-know-what plan into motion!

249
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,708
What plan?

250
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,250
You know, the plan!

251
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:22,292
What else would I be referring to
besides a field test of Future Gadget #8?!

252
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:25,208
Oh, the Phone Microwave (Temporary Name)?

253
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:29,333
But how do you "field test" a microwave?

254
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:33,042
We've known each other for
what, three and a half years now?

255
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:34,625
More like two;

256
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:38,208
we never talked 'cause we were
in different classes in high school.

257
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,833
Never mind the details.

258
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:43,375
Basically, we've known
each other a long time.

259
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,417
Isn't it about time you learn
to follow my train of thought?

260
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:49,125
No-can-do.

261
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,708
So you wanna give it
another whirl? It's all ready to go.

262
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,917
Mayuri! Bring the bananas!

263
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:54,833
Huh?

264
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,042
You're going to make more
gel-nanas? It's such a waste...

265
00:18:58,042 --> 00:19:01,125
We can't defeat the Organization
by being tightwads all the time!

266
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,125
We don't need to, though...

267
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:06,833
Mayushii pays for these
bananas, just so you know.

268
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,250
I know.

269
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:13,792
This is RENG, the Phone
Microwave (Temporary Name).

270
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:16,375
You can set the timer from here.

271
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:21,292
Please press the pound key, followed
by the number of seconds desired.

272
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:24,250
One-two-zero-pound.

273
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,208
Nice turntable, huh?

274
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,417
This one rotates in the
opposite direction than normal ones.

275
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:33,125
The opposite direction?

276
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,792
That could hold some major significance!

277
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:40,083
Looking at it at the quantum level,
Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity might--

278
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,083
Yeah... Not a chance.

279
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,125
--No?
--Nope.

280
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:52,125
Same as before. Neither
warmed-up nor cooled-down.

281
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:56,792
--Mayushii's Juicy #1 Chicken Tenders <i>did </i>freeze once--
--In any case, whatever's happening

282
00:19:56,792 --> 00:19:58,542
is clearly related to Steins Gate!

283
00:19:58,542 --> 00:19:59,875
Not <i>that </i>again...

284
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:03,208
--Daru. Don't you want to try these bananas--
--Hell no.

285
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,667
Then <i>you </i>may have the honors, Mayuri.

286
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:11,750
I dunno, gel-nanas are all
goopy and squishy and bland.

287
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,750
You <i>ate </i>one?

288
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,500
Mayushii...

289
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,292
Try saying, "Your banana's all squishy."

290
00:20:18,292 --> 00:20:20,958
Umm, your banana's all squi--

291
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,250
Don't make her say that, you perv!

292
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:29,708
This area is currently closed off.
Please use the east entrance--

293
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,042
I'm melting...

294
00:20:31,042 --> 00:20:34,375
We haven't even been
outside the lab ten minutes yet.

295
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:38,667
Faris-<i>tan</i>'s place is as far as
I can go during the summer.

296
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:42,708
Wish they'd hold this at
May Queen Nyan² instead...

297
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:46,500
A college lecture at a
maid café... That'd be the day.

298
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,583
I'd totally ditch if it wasn't
required for course credit...

299
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,542
Whew! Nice and cool!

300
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:58,000
Ah, I'm alive again.

301
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,708
A satellite came crashing down, huh?

302
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,625
You're still stuck on that?

303
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,250
You don't wanna check
out the Radio Building, Daru?

304
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,167
Probably so crowded you can't see anything.

305
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:12,042
I'm keeping tabs on Snake's
live coverage on @channel anyway.

306
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:16,042
Oh, work's suspended? Another uproar?

307
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,875
That's right! When it happened...!

308
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,917
--Give me your phone.
--What for?

309
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:23,667
Just give it here!

310
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:25,500
This is a violation of privacy!
I'm totally gonna--

311
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,542
--I sent you an e-mail!
--Huh?

312
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:29,958
One that said Makise Kurisu was stabbed.

313
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,250
Oh, that one from last week?

314
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,417
Last week?

315
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:37,333
You broke it into three parts.
I thought were you spammin' me!

316
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,958
See?

317
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:44,333
Received July 23, at 12:56...

318
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,125
See?

319
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,292
Last week...

320
00:21:48,292 --> 00:21:50,667
My message outbox!

321
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:52,833
It's not here! What's today's date?

322
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:56,250
Huh? It's the 28th.

323
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,167
What is it?

324
00:21:58,167 --> 00:22:00,500
My e-mail was sent back in time...

325
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,167
Huh?

326
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:35,042
<i>With my vision restricted, there's no escape</i>

327
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:43,792
<i>from the merciless control of the twelve</i>

328
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:52,667
