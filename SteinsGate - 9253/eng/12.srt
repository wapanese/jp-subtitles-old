1
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:19,000
This is Earth, 70 million years ago.

2
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:22,125
Mayuri?

3
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:28,417
You were sent here by a time machine.

4
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:29,833
Is that you, Mayuri?

5
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:37,292
Mayushii has chased you through
many, many, many world lines

6
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:39,917
to try to find you.

7
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:41,750
Mayuri...

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,833
You could say that the Okarin
here is just one of many Okarins,

9
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:49,333
and you also could say that he's the original.

10
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:55,167
You could say that the Mayushii
here is just one of many Mayushiis,

11
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:57,917
and you could also say that she's the original.

12
00:00:57,917 --> 00:01:04,583
Anyway, I think Okarin and
Mayushii are going to die here.

13
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:08,000
But I feel certain their
wills will carry on all the way

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
to the Okarin and Mayushii in
Akihabara 70 million years from now.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,542
So...

16
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,583
...it's okay.

17
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,542
Okarin!

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,542
Kurisu-<i>chan </i>says you should come!
She's almost finished with it!

19
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:41,167
Mayushii's costume is almost done too.

20
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,333
Come on! Hurry, hurry!

21
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:13,000

00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:28,125
Think you could hold this for me?

35
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,458
--Like this?
--Yes, just like that!

36
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:34,083
Hold it nice and wide!

37
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,667
Oh, that's a cute ribbon!

38
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:39,500
Isn't it, though?

39
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,292
Do you want to try it on? I have
plenty of other costumes for Comima!

40
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:45,500
Cosplay, huh...

41
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,958
Oh, are you interested?

42
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:51,167
O-Of course not! I couldn't
dress like that in public--

43
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,000
It's done!

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,250
Tadah!

45
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,083
Mayushii wins!

46
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,875
--We were racing!
--You got us.

47
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,292
But we're done too.

48
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:09,542
It's finished now.

49
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:13,417
This is... the time leap machine.

50
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:19,708
Wow...

51
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:23,958
It looks kinda like a hypno-gizmo
an evil organization would have.

52
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:28,125
It seems like Phone Microwave-<i>chan</i>,
but with a headset.

53
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,708
It might not look like much,

54
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:34,917
but theoretically it should be able
to send your memory back in time.

55
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:37,417
Especially now that we can use the LHC.

56
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:39,708
The LHC has something to do with it?

57
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:40,708
Yes.

58
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,750
Simply put, it's an issue of compression.

59
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,750
As I explained before,
this machine reads the signals

60
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:53,250
in the memory part of your brain and
converts it into 3.24 terabytes of data.

61
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,125
The Phone Microwave can only
send a little over 36 bytes of data.

62
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,583
Sending <i>terabytes </i>is
obviously out of the question

63
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:04,958
so first we send the data to the LHC
and compress it using a black hole.

64
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:09,667
Then we take that data and send it
back in time like we would a D-mail.

65
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:14,542
Like sticking a blanket
that won't fit in a closet

66
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:16,833
into a vacuum storage bag first?

67
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:21,083
Strictly speaking, it's different,
but that's one way of looking at it.

68
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:24,500
Just like with D-mail, we send
the data to a cell phone in the past.

69
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,042
Then, using the spread
signal from the cell phone,

70
00:05:28,042 --> 00:05:30,542
your present memories are
copied into your past brain,

71
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:34,667
producing a version of
you with your future memories.

72
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,542
We can only send the data
back 48 hours at most each time.

73
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:42,542
Sending it any further back
could cause the copy to fail

74
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:46,083
due to too many neurological differences.

75
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,958
--And there's one other problem.
--What's that?

76
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,292
Unlike with the Phone Microwave and D-mail,

77
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:57,083
we can't try it out... without
a test subject to use it on.

78
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,292
As we're sending memories,

79
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:03,500
the only way to tell if it works
or not is to test it on a human.

80
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,583
In other words, one of <i>us</i>
has to be the guinea pig?

81
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,167
I'll pass.

82
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:12,917
Okabe. Give me your opinion.

83
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:15,792
Not Hououin's opinion. Yours.

84
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,667
--Daru.
--'Zup?

85
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:24,458
I take it you still haven't figured
out how we got connected to SERN.

86
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,167
Right.

87
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:28,958
But there's no sign they noticed my hacking.

88
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,125
I agree with his assessment.

89
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,917
If they <i>had </i>noticed, they
would've taken some sort of action.

90
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:42,833
Is it really possible to transcend time?

91
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,917
Part of me wants to find out.

92
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:51,667
O-Oh, then can't we just have a
banana Mayushii bought time leap?

93
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:53,958
I explained it earlier, Mayuri.

94
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,042
Bananas don't have memories.

95
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:58,708
But we won't do the experiment.

96
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,583
We'll go public with it instead.

97
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:07,167
We'll give the time leap machine
to an appropriate organization.

98
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:09,667
Oh. I agree.

99
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:11,750
If that's what you want, then...

100
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,000
Mayushii totally agrees!

101
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,375
Let's see. Hashida ordered pizza, right?

102
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,250
Yeah.

103
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,917
Hmm. Then I guess I'll just make a salad.

104
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:30,750
--That just leaves--
--Wait.

105
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,625
What?

106
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:35,917
--You said "salad," right?
--That's right. A grapefruit salad.

107
00:07:35,917 --> 00:07:38,250
Then why are we buying
<i>natto </i>and ground beef?

108
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,792
Mixing stuff in makes it tasty.

109
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:43,875
The grapefruit's sourness makes
it a perfect match for anything.

110
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,542
N-No, it doesn't!

111
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:48,542
Does to. You should try it.

112
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:51,708
There's a salad right here!
One that's already ready!

113
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:55,250
--And it's 50% off--
--Ready-made stuff's no fun.

114
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,667
Sheesh, this is why men who only
care about experiments are no good.

115
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:02,000
Oh! Here's the cilantro!

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,458
It's me. The Organization
agent is finally making her move.

117
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,375
Request immediate backup!

118
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:12,667
You're almost like a cat back from the vet.

119
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:16,167
You look relieved, like, "I'm finally free!"

120
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:17,417
I'm surprised.

121
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:22,375
I figured you would've wanted to
do a time leap test right off the bat.

122
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,042
Does that bother you?

123
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,833
Well, you know...

124
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:35,542
Humans are essentially temporal beings.

125
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,583
That's what Heidegger said.

126
00:08:42,042 --> 00:08:45,958
I was honestly relieved when you
said we won't run the experiment.

127
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,417
I think everyone was, in fact.

128
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:54,583
Say, can we invite Ruka-<i>chan</i>
and Faris-<i>chan </i>to the party too?!

129
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,750
It's a development conference.

130
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:04,167
I think Mayuri might've wanted
us to stop for a long time now.

131
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:06,458
Yeah.

132
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,750
It's possible she saw
everything with clearer eyes

133
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,375
while we were so
focused on the experiments.

134
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:19,417
--When do we go public with it?
--The sooner the better.

135
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:23,625
Give me advance notice.
I want to let my mom know.

136
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,708
Also...

137
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:32,458
...this means my dad's going to
find out I made a time leap machine.

138
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,583
Might have to forget about Aomori.

139
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,208
This is going to be a big deal.

140
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,583
Don't worry.

141
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,875
You're a fellow lab member.
I'll solve your problems.

142
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:50,917
Right. Because you want an
assistant to push around, I'm sure.

143
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:53,708
Because you're a dear friend.

144
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,875
Th-Th-Thanks...

145
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,375
Huh?!

146
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,125
H-Huh?

147
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,792
W-Wait-- What are--?

148
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,000
Oww!

149
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,125
What's the big idea?!

150
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:15,083
Do you have a fever?! You're not
talking like an assistant at all!

151
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:19,125
I-I wasn't showing
appreciation to you just now.

152
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,792
I was just... thanking you out of formality.

153
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:25,125
--You're such a <i>tsundere</i>.
--Am not!

154
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,667
What's <i>your </i>deal?!

155
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:31,167
You're always talking crazy-talk and
now you suddenly bring up friendship!

156
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:33,583
You have no consistency whatsoever!

157
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,000
Don't be stupid. I'm <i>always </i>consistent.

158
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,583
Lab members are my allies,
and the world is my foe! That is all!

159
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:44,250
--You leave me speechless...
--You're speaking right now.

160
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:48,333
Quit nitpicking everything I say!

161
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,792
Welcome back.

162
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:54,542
Sneaking slices while we're gone?

163
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:56,125
That's bad manners, you know.

164
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,167
Cold pizza's no good.

165
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:01,083
More importantly, why did you
order three of the same type?!

166
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,042
My personal preference.

167
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:03,917
Why, you!

168
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:06,417
Do you honestly think you can
get away with such selfishness?!

169
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:09,667
See? It's a good thing we
picked up other food too.

170
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:12,125
Hold on while I whip something up.

171
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:15,750
--Why didn't you stop her?!
--I tried! With all my might!

172
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,292
Okarin! You promised to
protect your fellow lab members!

173
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:22,542
Don't lose heart! We aren't done for yet!

174
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:25,708
Who knows, maybe that apple
pie of hers was just an accident.

175
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,958
--Maybe she's actually--
--Oh, I forgot the radishes.

176
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,125
I'll just use shallots instead.

177
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:33,958
After this meal, I'm returning to
my hometown and getting married.

178
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,750
--I'm back! Too-too-roo!
--Mayuri!

179
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,458
Oh, thank goodness! Hurry to the kitchen--

180
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,667
Yo!

181
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:42,042
What's this, now? Something smells great!

182
00:11:42,042 --> 00:11:44,500
Oh, the pizza's already here?

183
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,375
Mayushii bought chicken tenders too--

184
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:55,125
Why are <i>you </i>here, Makise Kurisu?

185
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,250
Because I'm a member of this lab.

186
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,542
--Why are <i>you </i>here?
--Because I'm a lab member.

187
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:03,042
--What's goin' on?
--No idea.

188
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:05,833
Kurisu-<i>chan</i>. Did something
happen between you two?

189
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:09,792
No. She just makes
weird accusations about me.

190
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:13,417
--Like me being a SERN spy--
--It's not an accusation. It's the truth.

191
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:15,708
What makes you so sure about that?

192
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:19,375
--Do you have proof?
--No. But it <i>will </i>happen.

193
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,083
Huh?

194
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:24,333
Consider it a prophecy. I know
more about you than even you do.

195
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,917
I know what kind of
person you are deep down

196
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:29,458
and what sorts of things you're going to do.

197
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,500
I'm sorry.

198
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,208
Your theory is so full of holes
I don't understand a thing you're saying.

199
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:37,917
K-Kurisu-<i>chan</i>... Suzu-<i>san</i>...

200
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:40,708
Step back, Mayuri.

201
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,500
It appears only Hououin Kyouma
can pour oil on these troubled waters.

202
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,750
Assistant!

203
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,875
I don't remember
raising you to act this way!

204
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,333
And I don't remember <i>you </i>raising me.

205
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:55,750
Your journey to becoming
a mad scientist means you--

206
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,292
I never asked, nor do I intend to be one.

207
00:12:58,292 --> 00:12:59,458
Part-time Warrior!

208
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,875
I warned you, Okabe Rintaro.

209
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,250
I told you to beware of Makise Kurisu.

210
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,458
Y-Yes, you did say that, but...

211
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:10,375
Oh? And you believed her just like that?

212
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,417
N-No, I didn't...

213
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:15,250
--But you didn't argue I was wrong, either.
--W-Well, that's because...

214
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,000
--I think your good intentions backfired.
--Shut up!

215
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Let's see <i>you </i>try! You're the one who--

216
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,875
Umm...

217
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:26,917
Mayushii hates when people argue.

218
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:28,125
Mayuri...

219
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,167
I-I don't really like it, either...

220
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:37,250
When we're all together,
I think it'd be more fun if we get along!

221
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:54,125
Think long and hard!

222
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,042
Is that card a link, or is it a virus?

223
00:13:57,042 --> 00:13:58,000
Part-time Warrior.

224
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,500
Your fate as a warrior<i> and </i>the
last piece of dessert depends on it!

225
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:09,000
When in doubt, attack! That's my motto!

226
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:15,167
You fell for it, little girl!

227
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:17,292
You now have <i>three </i>viruses!

228
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:22,083
If you give up now, I will
grant you the cherry on top.

229
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,875
Miss Amane is too direct and honest.

230
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,500
You're being mean to her, Okarin.

231
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,625
In the world of competition, it's live
or die. Yes, that's how I was raised.

232
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:35,208
Those ones lined up in the
corner are definitely link cards.

233
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,250
Wha...?!

234
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,750
It's obvious, based on Okabe's
personality. Take 'em for yourself.

235
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,125
--Oh!
--She's right!

236
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,208
Assistant!

237
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,542
You would betray me?!
What kind of assistant are you?!

238
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:52,958
Quit calling me that! I can't stand
that high-and-mighty tone of yours!

239
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,417
You'll get no thanks from me...

240
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:58,250
Oh! Mayushii will help!

241
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,750
Oh, then could you
make tea for everyone?

242
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,750
Sure!

243
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,875
Now, then...

244
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,750
Thank you, Kurisu-<i>chan</i>.

245
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,917
For what?

246
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:11,833
For getting along with
Suzu-<i>san</i>. Mayushii is happy.

247
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,250
Ah.

248
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,083
I wouldn't say we're on good terms now,

249
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,125
but I thought you made a good point.

250
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:24,125
It'd be more fun if we all got
along when we're together.

251
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,833
Okabe and I were even saying earlier

252
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:31,708
about how you probably see
this lab with clearer eyes than us.

253
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:32,917
Huh?

254
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:37,833
For just that one moment,
Okabe had a gentle look on his face.

255
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:41,625
--It was a little creepy, though.
--Aww, that's not a nice thing to say...

256
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,833
Sorry! It's just...

257
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,167
Why, you...!

258
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:48,792
Part-time Warrior!
You did not win on your own!

259
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:53,083
--Don't get a big head!
--Wow! This really <i>is </i>good!

260
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,250
I'm going to devise a plan for Round 2.

261
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,250
Savor it while you can...

262
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,583
The last dessert of your life, that is!

263
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:06,000
Maybe you should check on him?
I'll handle things here.

264
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,625
Okay!

265
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:18,625
Okarin!

266
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,208
Whoa, what the...?

267
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:23,042
I couldn't find a flashlight.

268
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:27,042
That Glow Stick Saber is
Future Gadget #6. It's valuable.

269
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:31,875
--Don't use it as a flashlight.
--Aww, but it's so nice and bright...

270
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:40,958
--You seem to be having fun.
--Yep! I am!

271
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,708
The pizza was yummy,

272
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,833
and Suzu-<i>san </i>and Kurisu-<i>chan</i>
seem to be having a good time!

273
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,875
Well, <i>I'm </i>not.

274
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:55,167
Say, we have lots of lab members now, right?

275
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:58,417
So I've been thinking there
are things we could use lately...

276
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,833
--Like what?
--Let's see...

277
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:04,458
We could use some chairs,
oh, and some dishes...

278
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,125
Just wait a little longer.

279
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,208
Once we go public with
the time leap machine,

280
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:11,125
I'm sure we'll get paid
in <i>some </i>way or another.

281
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,792
That'll solve everything.

282
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:15,375
For real? We can buy chairs and dishes?

283
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,000
Yep, we sure can.

284
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,625
And if I said we could get even more?

285
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,750
A microwave too, then!

286
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,583
I don't like how I can't
heat up my chicken tenders!

287
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,875
Aye. I'll consider it.

288
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,250
It's strange.

289
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,625
You seemed so sad earlier this spring...

290
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:46,708
The lab was so quiet. There was
only the sound of your computer.

291
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:51,458
But now there's Daru-<i>kun</i>, Kurisu-<i>chan</i>...

292
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:55,625
...Ruka-<i>chan</i>, Suzu-<i>san</i>, Moeka-<i>san...</i>

293
00:17:56,417 --> 00:18:01,250
...Faris-<i>chan</i>, Mr. Braun, and Nae-<i>chan</i>...

294
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,875
Mayuri.

295
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:09,208
I guess Mayushii doesn't really
need to be your hostage anymore, huh?

296
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,000
Okarin! Mayushii!

297
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,042
Come quick! The trains have stopped!

298
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:28,917
Again, a bomb threat has shut
down all trains on the following lines:

299
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:31,708
Yamanote Line. Soubu Line...

300
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,458
Terrorist threats cause so much trouble.

301
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,958
I'll need to call home...

302
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:41,250
This party is to celebrate the completion
of the time leap machine, right?

303
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,792
That's right. Why do you ask?

304
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:46,125
Are you guys still hacking into SERN?

305
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,583
Not exactly; we're already
pretty much deep inside...

306
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:50,750
What do you mean?!

307
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,917
We have a direct
connection with SERN now.

308
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,042
There's no time, you guys! You have to--

309
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:10,375
I'm sorry. I have to go.

310
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,375
Huh? Suzu-<i>san</i>?

311
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,875
What's with her?

312
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,500
What are you gonna do, Mayushii?
You gonna take a taxi home?

313
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,667
Hmm, I don't have the money for a taxi...

314
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:48,875
Huh? Mayushii's watch has stopped...

315
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,833
That's strange.

316
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:55,083
I wound it up just a little while ago...

317
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:08,792
--Wh-What is this?
--Hold on...!

318
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,375
Wh-What's going on?!

319
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,042
...all train lines remain on--

320
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,958
Don't move. Everyone put your hands up.

321
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,167
Moeka-<i>san</i>...

322
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:46,792
Kiryu... Moeka...

323
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,333
SERN will take your time machine now.

324
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,000
SERN?! What do you mean?!

325
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,792
Makise Kurisu...

326
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:58,250
Okabe Rintaro...

327
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,792
Hashida Itaru...

328
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:02,375
You three will come with us.

329
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,875
Wh-What about Mayuri...?

330
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,958
Shiina Mayuri...

331
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,583
...is unnecessary.

332
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:17,917
Stop...

333
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,292
Please stop...!

334
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:23,833
For FB...

335
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:27,208
FB... FB...!

336
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,375
Mayuri...

337
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,875
Mayuri!

338
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,000
Mayuri...

339
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,708
What is this...?

340
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:14,167
