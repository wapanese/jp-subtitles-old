00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,458
Whoa... Okarin?!

2
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,125
How...?

3
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:25,833
How?

4
00:00:28,792 --> 00:00:29,875
Real...!

5
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,708
She's really real...

6
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:36,292
You're not a ghost?!

7
00:00:36,292 --> 00:00:38,333
Do you <i>want </i>me to call the cops?!

8
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,375
I just wish to know the truth!

9
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:43,083
You were stabbed right around...

10
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:45,958
What do you mean by "truth"?!

11
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,583
Are you an idiot? Are you gonna die?!

12
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,625
Louise-<i>chan</i>'s famous line, FTW!

13
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:54,292
You were stabbed!
I saw it with my own two eyes!

14
00:00:54,292 --> 00:00:57,000
Three hours ago, during Dr. Nakabachi's
press conference at the Radio--

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,833
Okarin! "Ix-nay" the "elusions-day"!

16
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,583
Dr. Nakabachi's conference
was canceled, remember?!

17
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:03,833
But...!

18
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:07,375
Makise-<i>san</i>! It's almost time!

19
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,083
Right!

20
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,208
Hold it! You're running away?!

21
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,583
You're...

22
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:15,292
Don't call me "you"!

23
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:18,792
I'm Hououin... Kyouma!

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,583
Thank you all for coming today.

38
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:06,167
I don't have much
experience giving lectures like this,

39
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:08,042
so please bear with me.

40
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:11,458
Makise Kurisu is our lecturer?

41
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,333
I guess she <i>isn't </i>a ghost...

42
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,583
You're still stuck on that?

43
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:20,125
I've been asked to speak
about time machines today.

44
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:23,750
Although it wasn't the
topic of my paper in <i>Sciency</i>,

45
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,708
I'd like to give it a try.

46
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:27,833
Time machines?

47
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:36,083
Basically, my belief is that "time
machines"... are nothing but nonsense.

48
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,708
I'll now explain how
I was led to this conclusion--

49
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:40,833
Objection!

50
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,083
Huh?

51
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:45,083
"Time machines are impossible?"

52
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,833
You're jumping to conclusions!

53
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,250
You've really lost it, Okarin...

54
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,958
You...

55
00:03:55,042 --> 00:04:01,500
I disagree. I believe they
are theoretically impossible.

56
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,250
Do go on.

57
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:08,958
In that case, let's switch to
a discussion format instead.

58
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:12,875
That should make it easier for
certain stubborn individuals to grasp.

59
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:16,542
Don't you agree, Hououin Kyouma-<i>san</i>?

60
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:30,000
Makise Kurisu...

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
From this, we see that
time travel is unrealistic

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,792
in the context of cosmic string theory.

63
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:39,917
Any arguments, Hououin-<i>san</i>?

64
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,750
I see.

65
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:48,917
Then please find some
exotic matter for us, Hououin-<i>san</i>.

66
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,250
That concludes my line of reasoning,

67
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,542
but if you have any rebuttals
I'm all ears, Hououin-<i>san</i>.

68
00:04:57,542 --> 00:05:02,250
Argh! Thinks she's hot stuff,
just 'cause she's <i>kinda </i>smart!

69
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,542
Wait. She's probably an
agent for the Organization.

70
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:08,542
In fact, the lecture itself

71
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:11,792
may've been tactical psychological
warfare targeted right at me...

72
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:13,917
I won't fall for it.

73
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,125
Eight...

74
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,500
Nine...

75
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,833
Just one more!

76
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,375
Ready, go!

77
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,250
Ten!

78
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,083
You're great, Ruka-<i>kun</i>!

79
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,417
Oh, Okarin! Too-too-roo!

80
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:37,750
Huh?

81
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,333
Okabe-<i>s</i>-- I mean, Kyouma-<i>san</i>...

82
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:44,167
You've forgotten the code words, Rukako.

83
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:49,292
Huh? Oh, E-El Psy C-Congree...

84
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:52,625
--Congroo.
--S-Sorry.

85
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,917
So, what do you need me to carry?

86
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:56,500
These.

87
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,250
Sorry to ask.

88
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,917
Mayushii didn't think she
could carry them all by herself.

89
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:06,417
They were given to my father,
but we can't eat them all.

90
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:10,417
I see. I appreciate your
donating food to the lab.

91
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:12,458
It should increase member morale.

92
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,125
I'm so glad you like them!

93
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,750
Oh, err, uhh...

94
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,250
Ruka does her sword-swinging
practice every day!

95
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,667
Yes. I promised Oka-- I mean,
Kyouma-<i>san</i>, that I would.

96
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:26,833
Aye.

97
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:30,542
The Supernatural Sword Samidare
shall demonstrate its true power

98
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:33,042
once it deems you a worthy wielder.

99
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:34,542
--Do not forget that.
--Right!

100
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:40,792
And it only cost 980 yen at
the weapons shop! What a deal!

101
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:44,750
Now, let's see the results of your training.

102
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,750
--Can you perform an exorcism?
--Huh? I-I suppose so...

103
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,333
But for a proper exorcism,
my father is much--

104
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:58,792
A-An evil spirit has
possessed my right hand!

105
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,042
Hurry and exorcise it!

106
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:03,375
--Before it fully overcomes me!
--Right!

107
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,875
That's the opposite hand from last time.

108
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:09,208
Th-The spirit chose this one today!

109
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,125
Urushibara Ruka.

110
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,458
The voice and mannerisms of a woman...

111
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:18,625
No, even more feminine than a woman.

112
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,333
But he's a dude.

113
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:25,000
Taller than Mayuri, and
with such a slender figure.

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,792
But he's a dude.

115
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:29,292
Looks great in a shrine maiden outfit...

116
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:31,875
But he's a dude.

117
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:35,333
The sun is setting, yet it's still so hot out.

118
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,667
The cicadas are buzzing.

119
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:39,083
But...

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,708
...he's a dude.

121
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,542
Bye-bye!

122
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:50,083
It's incredible that Ruka-<i>kun</i>
can perform exorcisms!

123
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,542
He's the son of a shrine family, after all.

124
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:55,000
Whoosh! Whoosh!

125
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,625
Sorry!

126
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,292
It's blocked off?

127
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:07,417
Yeah, this leads to the
back of the Radio Building...

128
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:09,333
The Radio Building...

129
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,792
Give me yours too.

130
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:20,917
Huh?

131
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,167
You got work, right? Give 'em here.

132
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:27,083
Okay. Thanks.

133
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:35,875
I have a late shift today, so I'll probably
just head straight home after work.

134
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,083
Mayuri!

135
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:41,083
You really didn't hear a scream?

136
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,333
A scream? When?

137
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,333
Today, at the Radio Building.

138
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,375
I don't think so...

139
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,208
Oh.

140
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,958
Okay, then.

141
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,583
Huh? You're so goofy, Okarin.

142
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:01,875
No one remembers at all...

143
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:09,167
Not Mayuri, Daru, <i>or </i>Makise Kurisu...

144
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:12,583
Closing early today, Mr. Braun!

145
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,833
I told ya to quit calling me that.

146
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,875
I'm interviewin' a part-timer today.

147
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,375
A part-timer?

148
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:25,083
At a dingy shop with no customers,
run by some filthy old man?

149
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,708
Say again?

150
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,167
Whassup!

151
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,625
Huh?

152
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:37,125
Huh? I heard that's a
trendy way of saying "hello"...

153
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,083
Don't tell me <i>she's </i>your part-timer?

154
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,417
Got a problem with that?

155
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:42,250
--Name?
--Amane Suzuha.

156
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,458
--Age?
--18.

157
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,750
--Reason for applying?
--I love CRT TVs.

158
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,750
--You're hired.
--Hooray!

159
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,958
What is this, a comedy skit? A joke?

160
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,667
Who are you, anyway?

161
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:54,458
Name's Okabe. He's an
idiot who rents a room upstairs.

162
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,417
It's not "Okabe"! It's Hououin--

163
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:58,583
Shut up! Don't make me double your rent!

164
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,583
--I'm Okabe Rintaro.
--Nice to meetcha!

165
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,583
Hey, what's in the bags?

166
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,750
Oh. Intelligence Corn
that was donated to the lab.

167
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,875
If you want some, appropriate compensation is--

168
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,417
Corn? Like with the little bumps?

169
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:13,542
--Wow, so this is what it starts out like!
--You've never seen corn before?

170
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:15,833
--Can I see--?
--Whoa, there.

171
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:20,833
The Organization has targeted
many who've crossed paths with me.

172
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:24,458
Sara, Claudia, Simone...

173
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,708
Oh. You can talk to me about it, if you'd like.

174
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,792
Don't take him seriously. He's delusional.

175
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:32,708
Oh?

176
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,792
Yes, just keep telling yourself that.

177
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:38,958
Someday, the world <i>will </i>kneel before me.

178
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:45,000
Wow. So that's what's trendy these--

179
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:03,833
It crashed around noon...

180
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,917
Mayuri and Daru were right.

181
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,208
The conference was canceled?

182
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,917
"Makise Kurisu incident"...

183
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:29,542
Did I just hallucinate it all...?

184
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,208
John Titor?

185
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,833
SERN maintains a strict monopoly
on the time machine market.

186
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:57,750
Neither civilians nor
corporations can acquire one.

187
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:03,583
They've used them for their personal
gain, to create a dystopian world.

188
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:07,250
I've come to change the future.

189
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:12,750
To destroy SERN's
dystopia and restore freedom.

190
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,542
So you're saying SERN = dictators?

191
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:18,958
Ah, the so-called "Grandfather Paradox"?

192
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,667
It doesn't exist.

193
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:23,208
It's possible to meet your past self.

194
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,958
You'll simply change world lines if you do.

195
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:32,292
First, time isn't a single line
moving from past to future.

196
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:38,375
It's comprised of infinite parallel lines
called "world lines" that flow like a river.

197
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:42,833
For example, let's say a
maniac murders you today.

198
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:47,792
If I go back in time to prevent it,
it would create two divergent worlds:

199
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:52,333
one in which you die and
one in which you survive.

200
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,000
So now Titor is Japanese, huh?

201
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
A self-proclaimed time traveler

202
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,667
who appeared on the American Internet in 2000...

203
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:10,542
He claimed to have come from
the year 2036 to save the future.

204
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:14,792
It took the Internet by storm, and
many books were written about him.

205
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:20,333
I just can't believe there's an idiot
pretending to be John Titor now...

206
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:24,250
Just click this link and go read up on Titor...

207
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,583
Dammit, Daru. You deleted
the link about Titor...

208
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,292
Twelve results? That's impossible.

209
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:38,917
Even if it <i>was </i>ten years ago,
it still caused a huge uproar!

210
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:41,875
That can't be right!

211
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,958
They're gone! They're gone!

212
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,292
How come?! I had books about him right here!

213
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:49,917
Damn!

214
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:56,917
Hello?! Daru?!

215
00:13:56,917 --> 00:13:59,417
What is it? I'm with Faris-<i>tan</i>--

216
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:01,917
--Where are the books?!
--Huh? What books?

217
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:04,292
The ones about John Titor!

218
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:07,708
They were all on the bookshelf! Where are they?!

219
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,250
--Hold on, Okarin.
--What?!

220
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,833
Who's... John Titor?

221
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,750
I stayed up almost all night
trying to find out about John Titor.

222
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,708
I scoured the Internet for
whatever information I could find.

223
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,333
But...

224
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,542
I have a question for you, Titor.

225
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:33,958
About ten years ago...
The year 2000, in other words.

226
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,500
That's an interesting thing to ask.

227
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,167
Unfortunately, however,
I've never visited the year 2000.

228
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:44,250
Nor do I have any plans to...

229
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,333
H-Hey! Wait!

230
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,583
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

231
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,792
Not so fast! I mean, wait! If you'd please!

232
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:07,708
You just took a picture of me!
You should delete it, for you own safety!

233
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:13,375
I apologize if I've displeased you.

234
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,750
What were you taking pictures of?

235
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,333
Proof.

236
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:26,958
Proof of where I was
today... Of what I saw...

237
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,625
I want to ask you something.

238
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,250
Huh?

239
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,125
This.

240
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:39,542
--That's a pretty old PC.
--You recognize it?

241
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:42,167
--Oh, no.
--Do you know someone who would?

242
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:44,167
I bet you Daru might.

243
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:45,708
Who's that?

244
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,542
That's none of your business.

245
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:49,583
Make sure you delete that picture!

246
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:55,208
Give me his e-mail address.

247
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,542
I refuse!

248
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,500
Are you trying to blackmail me?

249
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,125
If you tell me, I'll delete it.

250
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,458
V-Very well.

251
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,458
But I won't sell out my comrade!

252
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,000
I'll give you <i>my </i>address instead.

253
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:18,542
What's your name?

254
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:21,167
It says "Hououin Kyouma" right there!

255
00:16:26,292 --> 00:16:27,917
Let me do it.

256
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:37,542
Send me a blank message.
I'll send you a reply later.

257
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:43,042
Welcome home, Master! Meow!

258
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:46,042
Oh! It's Okarin!

259
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:49,292
Welcome home, Okarin!

260
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:51,750
Yo, Mayuri.

261
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,417
It's "Mayushii Meow-Meow" while I'm working!

262
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:59,208
Say, I just realized that "Okarin"
sounds kind of like "ocarina," huh?

263
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:02,375
--Uhh... Where's Daru?
--He's inside.

264
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,500
Oh! Kyouma?!

265
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,167
It's about time, meow!

266
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:09,292
What happened to your promise
to visit every three days, meow?!

267
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:11,667
My apologies. Organization
interference has been terrible--

268
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:14,583
What?! The Organization is that close now?!

269
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,333
Are you holding another top-secret
meeting to overthrow them then?

270
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:20,333
Indeed. My usual Stealth Field, please.

271
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,042
You got it, meow! I wish you'd let me join too--

272
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,917
No! You're not a match for the Organization!

273
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:29,792
Faris has a forbidden secret move, meow.

274
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:33,000
What?! You've actually mastered it?!

275
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,750
That's right!

276
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,125
After months of difficult
training in the Guiana Highlands

277
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:40,167
and overcoming the death of
her master, Faris at long last...

278
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:43,333
...acquired the skill!

279
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,000
I'll never forgive you. Ever.

280
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:50,625
So, about the mail I sent you...

281
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,333
I feel talking to a winner
would make <i>me </i>a loser.

282
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,583
Ugh...

283
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:58,708
Don't worry. I've no interest in
a girl who spews nothing but lies.

284
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:02,250
Oh, is this today's
"Shut your filthy mouth" thread?

285
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,708
Be quiet, cheater! Your 2D wives are crying!

286
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:09,667
Faris-<i>tan </i>doesn't count!
She may be 3D, but she has a 2D soul!

287
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:11,750
Whatever. Just take a look at this.

288
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,208
This photo...

289
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:17,125
Oh! This is an IBN 5100, right?

290
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,167
IBN?

291
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:21,292
It's an ultra-rare retro PC.

292
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:24,375
About a month or so ago
there was a rumor going around

293
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,458
about one lurking somewhere in Akihabara.

294
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,000
She probably caught wind of that.

295
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,292
--And?
--It was never found.

296
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:33,875
Even the "Quick as Lightning
Knight Heart" tried to find it to no avail,

297
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:37,042
so it must never have existed
in the first place. Final answer.

298
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:39,083
It's that valuable?

299
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:42,458
It was sold over 30 years ago.

300
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:46,667
Prices were still so high that
nobody could buy computers back then.

301
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,625
That's how stuff turns super-rare.

302
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,125
Hmm...

303
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:54,542
That girl from earlier...

304
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:59,375
"I'm mailing you already.
My name is Kiryu Moeka.

305
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:03,875
I'm 20. I'm a freeter. Like it or
not, I'm gonna keep mailing ya!"

306
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:07,375
<i>This </i>is the same girl?

307
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,333
What's up?

308
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,875
Be thankful I didn't sell you out.

309
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:16,625
"It's a rare PC. Probably none in Akiba.

310
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,750
El Psy Congroo."

311
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:23,375
Master! Your food's ready, meow-meow!

312
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,792
W00t!

313
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:27,042
"The World's in Danger" FTW!

314
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:28,417
Down the hatch!

315
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,833
--Please enjoy!
--Calm down.

316
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,667
Whoa, this is seriously good!

317
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:40,708
Analysis at the university laboratory

318
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:44,208
indicates that the gel-nanas have
been torn apart at the molecular level.

319
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:48,833
Meaning they turned into non-bananas?

320
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:53,250
That can't be good. What's causing it?

321
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,875
The only theory I have
for now is that it's caused

322
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:59,042
by the EM waves from the Phone
Microwave (Temporary Name)...

323
00:19:59,042 --> 00:20:02,750
--Based on...?
--A mad scientist's sixth-sense.

324
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,292
Gotcha. No basis.

325
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:06,667
'Kay! All hooked up!

326
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:08,708
Excellent! Then let us use these!

327
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,208
Aren't these Mayushii's?

328
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:17,375
Fear not. I used research funds
she donated to buy them myself.

329
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:21,667
--Uhh, that makes them hers--
--Now let's toss 'em in and see what happens.

330
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:23,833
One is enough, IMHO.

331
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:31,500
Can we really test the true power of the
Microwave Phone (Temporary Name) like that?

332
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,458
We really need to drop the
"(Temporary Name)" thing. It's annoying.

333
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,333
We cannot hope to alter
the world's ruling structure

334
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,958
by being cheap with our experiments!

335
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,167
You're the only one who wants to do that.

336
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:52,625
--Is that so?
--Indeed, it is.

337
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,250
It's done.

338
00:20:58,708 --> 00:20:59,583
What is it?

339
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,917
The banana... It's gone!

340
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,083
That's absurd!

341
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:11,833
It's me! Emergency order
#666! Activate the cool-off!

342
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,917
Government approval?!
This is no time for that--

343
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:16,375
Acting fail!

344
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,125
Shut up! Where'd you hide it?!

345
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:22,833
Wha...?! You're the one who hid it!

346
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:27,542
Aha, I got it! This must
be a microwave teleporter!

347
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:29,917
Wh-What?!

348
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:32,000
That's crazy talk.

349
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,375
Then how do you explain how a
banana we pulled from the bunch

350
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,208
and put into the microwave suddenly--

351
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:48,167
A gel-nana...?

352
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:52,708
I-Is it just me, or is it
completely attached to the bunch?

353
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:57,125
--You took one off a minute ago, right?!
--I-I'm pretty sure...

354
00:21:57,125 --> 00:22:00,417
Could it really be a teleporter?

355
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:02,542
You think so?

356
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:06,833
You're conducting a very
intriguing experiment, Okabe Rintaro.

357
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:10,625
No, Hououin Kyouma-<i>san</i>, was it?

358
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:16,333
Makise Kurisu...!
