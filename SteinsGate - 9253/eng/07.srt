1
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:13,167
Tremble, right arm of mine.

2
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:17,542
By our agreement, I order you...

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,542
Swathed in flames of pure
blackness, fulfill my desire!

4
00:00:28,292 --> 00:00:30,708
Now I can't heat up my
chicken tenders anymore!

5
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:31,792
--Are you sure about this?
--Mayuri.

6
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:35,792
--This is how lab members get treated...
--It's not a microwave; it's a time machine!

7
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:37,417
That's so mean!

8
00:00:37,417 --> 00:00:41,000
You should go buy us a new microwave then!

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,917
I haven't the money.

10
00:00:43,917 --> 00:00:46,917
I told you, no pictures of me!

11
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:48,417
--As a memento.
--Huh?

12
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:50,000
Whatever! No pictures!

13
00:00:51,042 --> 00:00:53,875
Okay! Programming's done!

14
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:57,875
The Phone Microwave 2nd
Edition Version 1.03 is complete!

15
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:02,417
Now we can send a D-mail
to any number we want!

16
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:04,292
Excellent work, Daru!

17
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:07,042
Then let's restart the experiments!

18
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:09,458
Is it really... a time machine?

19
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:11,792
Not a word to <i>anyone</i>, got it?

20
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:16,042
I hope the shopkeeper
won't get mad at us again...

21
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:18,583
Part-time warrior!

22
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,542
--Hi! Too-too-roo!
--Too-too-roo!

23
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:22,833
--Mayuri! Be quiet!
--Too-too-roo!

24
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,583
--Where's Mr. Braun?
--Who?

25
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:26,542
--Dad's name <i>isn't </i>Mr. Braun, you know.

26
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:28,917
--Oh, the boss is out doing a house call.
--Dad's name <i>isn't </i>Mr. Braun, you know.

27
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:31,083
--He should be gone for a while.
--Really?!

28
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,208
I wouldn't be slacking off otherwise--

29
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:41,542
Mayuri.

30
00:01:58,292 --> 00:02:00,042
This is...!

31
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:02,500
Oh, there was a light...

32
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:21,792
<i>For you, billions and billions of heartbeats</i>

33
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:28,458
<i>are nothing at all; just the blink of an eye</i>

34
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:33,708
<i>Although I'm trapped by</i>
<i>the past and lament the future</i>

35
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:39,625
<i>inevitability won't allow for</i>
<i>even a speck of a miscalculation</i>

36
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:45,750
<i>Our dreams and futures that</i>
<i>form and expand into "infinity"</i>

37
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:51,583
<i>allow us the right to be vain,</i>

38
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:57,792
<i>while the two hands</i>
<i>point out what is "finite"</i>

39
00:02:57,792 --> 00:03:02,375
<i>All of which leads to a cruel</i>
<i>contract and choice to make</i>

40
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,625
<i>Hacking to the Gate</i>

41
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:11,542
<i>So, now, with each passing</i>
<i>second, I'll cross world lines</i>

42
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:16,500
<i>to protect that smile on your face</i>

43
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,500
<i>Then, once again, into a</i>
<i>time loop without sadness</i>

44
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:30,167
<i>I will be swallowed up as a lone observer</i>

45
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:45,917
Juicy #1 Chicken Tenders
are tastier if you ask me...

46
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,208
Hey! You forgot the Dk Pepper!

47
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,292
They were out.

48
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:52,917
Then you should've kept
looking until you found some!

49
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:56,042
That's what any true Dk Pepperian would do!

50
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:59,125
They were out of it! Don't blame me!

51
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,125
Have this instead.

52
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:04,625
Geez...

53
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:09,542
What kind of mad scientist
worries about his vegetable intake?

54
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:14,042
Now let's begin our round table meeting!

55
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:16,583
Man, it's hot with all the windows shut.

56
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,708
What are you doing, Daru?!

57
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,458
What if the Organization learns our secret?!

58
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,208
Delusion FTL!

59
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:32,208
As of now, we're moving
to Phase 2 of Operation Urd:

60
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:36,375
experiments into making
D-mail more practical to use.

61
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:40,125
Barley tea's great in the summer!
Would you like some too, Moeka-<i>san</i>?

62
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,875
What exactly do you mean by "practical"?

63
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,583
We're going to change the past.

64
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:54,000
Hold on! It's too dangerous!
What if we cause a time paradox?

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,958
Assistant.

66
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,958
As a scientist, are you not intrigued to see

67
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,667
if D-mails can alter the past or not?

68
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,208
Th-That's not what--

69
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,083
But what are you going to change?

70
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,750
I'm glad you asked.

71
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,083
My aim of this operation is...

72
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:14,958
...to win the lottery!

73
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,833
Okarin... Mayushii is sad.

74
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,583
Count me in!

75
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:26,625
--I'd be able to buy PC parts and visit May Queen as much as I want!
--Don't you think we should use it

76
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,500
to help with world peace or something?

77
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,000
We could give everyone in the world

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,833
--You couldn't aim any lower, Okabe.
--an Oopa cushion!

79
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:38,042
We're seeing if we can alter the past or not!

80
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:40,125
And this is the easiest way to tell!

81
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,042
--But it's still about the money.
--Silence, Celeb 17!

82
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,667
Celeb? Huh?!

83
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:48,333
Celeb 17!

84
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,167
Someone who lives in a
hotel on her parents' dime

85
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,292
has no place criticizing me!

86
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:55,208
I'm eighteen.

87
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:58,292
There's all kinds of lotteries, though, y'know?

88
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:59,667
Which should we do?

89
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:02,625
Aye. I would have to say...

90
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,458
--What's wrong?
--Oh, nothing.

91
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,125
Where did Moeka go?

92
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,750
Huh?

93
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,917
Stop right there!

94
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:15,708
There.

95
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,125
Man. Can't even look away for a second.

96
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,333
You didn't reply, so...

97
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:27,000
Is she an honest-to-goodness
ditz or something?

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,833
Christina! Stand guard and make
sure she doesn't wander around!

99
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:35,042
Stand guard...?

100
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:37,667
Oh, do you want to see the lab, Moeka-<i>san</i>?!

101
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:42,292
Then I'll take you on a tour of
it later! Mayushii's great at it!

102
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:45,458
In fact, I gave Kurisu-<i>chan </i>the tour too!

103
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,958
I wonder where we should start!

104
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:52,333
Ah! The Loto 6!

105
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,083
The winning numbers are
announced every Thursday.

106
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,042
So we'll send them to the past.

107
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:03,083
--We're really going to do it?
--You got any other ideas?

108
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:06,042
Which winning numbers should we send?

109
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:08,458
Incidentally, the jackpot is...

110
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,042
...around 200 million yen!

111
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:12,125
2-200 million?!

112
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,542
Hold on, Daru!

113
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:15,625
--200 million is a bit much...
--Huh?

114
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,792
H-Hitting the jackpot would
attract too much attention.

115
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:20,750
And with the Organization out to get me...

116
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,708
Scaredy-cat.

117
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,500
--What's the second prize?
--Let's see...

118
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,292
23 million yen.

119
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:27,458
Third prize?!

120
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,500
700,000.

121
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,667
That one!

122
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:32,708
You're such a chicken, Okabe.

123
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:36,250
--<i>You're </i>always scared of time paradoxes!
--And this is an Oopa cushion!

124
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,583
You hug it tight when you're
tired or need cheering up!

125
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,542
And this is the refrigerator!

126
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,292
Today, we have...

127
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:48,917
Umm...

128
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,583
Hey! Shining Finger!

129
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:03,583
Here is your first assignment as a lab member.

130
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,500
Oh! It's your first job!

131
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,625
Come up with the D-mail message.

132
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:15,125
Something that'll convince me
one week ago to buy a Loto 6 ticket.

133
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:20,375
Seven days back equals 168 hours...
So about 170 seconds on the timer?

134
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,708
Aye.

135
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,250
This should do it.

136
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay, everything's set.

137
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,542
At last, Steins Gate shall be opened!

138
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:31,000
Not that again. You never let up, do you?

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,875
Why do <i>you </i>always gotta be a wet blanket?!

140
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,125
You seemed to be having fun...

141
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,375
--Huh?
--F-Fun? Are you kidding me?!

142
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,125
"Man, this assistant is a total <i>tsundere</i>!"

143
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,542
Who're you calling a <i>tsundere</i>?!

144
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:50,833
Oh! You know what a <i>tsundere </i>is, Miss Makise?

145
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,417
N-No!

146
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:54,375
No, you acted like you know...

147
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,500
Seriously, I don't know that word!

148
00:08:58,417 --> 00:09:01,500
Okay! I'm gonna start the microwave!

149
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:20,417
It's too dangerous!
What if we cause a time paradox?

150
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,542
This is no time to wimp out...!

151
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:35,667
El Psy...

152
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,125
...Congroo!

153
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:59,042
Okarin!

154
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,750
Okarin?

155
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:07,167
Are you okay?

156
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:09,625
I-I just...

157
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,875
How long have I been standing here?

158
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,125
Huh?

159
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,417
About 30 seconds, I guess?

160
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:21,958
30 seconds?!

161
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,625
You don't remember?

162
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:27,500
You were just talking about the
D-mail experiment to alter the past.

163
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,458
And then...

164
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:32,375
You suddenly came over to Phone
Microwave-<i>chan </i>and went, "Ahh, ahh..."

165
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,875
Mayushii, could you say, "Ahh, ahh," again?

166
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,500
--Knock it off, pervert!
--Yes, Ma'am.

167
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:50,042
It arrived...

168
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,000
Are you sure you're okay, Okabe?

169
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,333
The money! The Loto 6!

170
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,750
Celeb 17! Did we win third prize?!

171
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,750
Don't call me that!

172
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,667
Wait, what are you talking about?

173
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:05,333
Wh-What do you mean, "what"?!

174
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,958
Okarin?

175
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,750
You know, the experiment!
The D-mail experiment to change the past!

176
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:16,542
That's what we were just doing--
coming up with a message to send.

177
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,208
Huh?

178
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:22,042
Mayushii thinks we should use it to
help with world peace or something!

179
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:25,500
They really don't remember...?

180
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,042
Come in!

181
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:35,750
Oh, Ruka-<i>kun</i>! Come on in!

182
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:41,292
I'm sorry, Kyouma-<i>san</i>!

183
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:42,958
Ruka-<i>kun</i>?

184
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,458
Here...

185
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:48,750
02, 12, 18...

186
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,167
They're the same...

187
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,667
Rukako! Where'd you get this?!

188
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:57,000
Oh? You, umm, told me the numbers, and...

189
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,083
I did?!

190
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,667
You told me to buy a ticket because
they might be winning numbers...

191
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:03,083
Wha...? When?

192
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,917
A week ago.

193
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:07,750
Oh! You're psychic, Okarin!

194
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,333
So, did you win the Loto 6, Miss Ruka?

195
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,583
Well, actually...

196
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,792
I got one of the numbers wrong, and...

197
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:20,250
Whoa, so close!

198
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,667
Crazy close!

199
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:26,083
Okabe... Did you use
the Phone Microwave to...?

200
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:30,750
You forgot the Dk Pepper!

201
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,083
They were out of it! Don't blame me!

202
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,750
I'm certain I sent a D-mail.

203
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,292
But there's no record of it...

204
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:51,875
Could it be that the past was rewritten?

205
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:55,917
They had no memory of the experiment.

206
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:59,625
We discussed it and observed it together...

207
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,000
...yet I'm the only one who remembers.

208
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,833
I'm the only one...

209
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,583
This feels just like then.

210
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,250
What does this mean?

211
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,208
What's that?

212
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,458
Something dear to me.

213
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,333
What's wrong?

214
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:38,792
You look like you've been brainwashed.

215
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:41,750
Brainwashed...

216
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,417
Maybe.

217
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:47,083
Perhaps I've been brainwashed, or they have--

218
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,917
What are you--?!

219
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,083
You're not chipped.

220
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:04,208
It's okay! You haven't been brainwashed!

221
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,083
Ch-Chipped?

222
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,917
What's "brainwashed"?

223
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:10,500
It's, well...

224
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,083
Hououin Kyouma shall tell you.

225
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:18,542
It looks like Nae is afraid of Okabe Rintaro.

226
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:22,458
I have a question for you.

227
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,333
A discharge? The thing that shakes the place?

228
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,208
There was one a while earlier.

229
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,500
There should've been one ten minutes ago too.

230
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,875
I didn't notice that one...

231
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,333
--Did you, Nae?
--No.

232
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:41,500
You're such a creepy perv!

233
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,625
Am not!

234
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,333
I'm a perverted gentleman!

235
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,125
See? I told you you can hear everything.

236
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,625
I didn't know it was like <i>this</i>...

237
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,417
Wait, did you hear us talking
about time machines too...?!

238
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:55,625
Yep! Good going, by the way!

239
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,458
--I have to warn you--
--I know, I know.

240
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,583
I won't tell a soul.

241
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:05,250
Oh! Is your time machine
what's troubling you?

242
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,917
Then why don't you ask John Titor for advice?

243
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,500
Come to think of it, Titor did
mention that going back in time

244
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,792
and altering the past will change
a so-called "divergence number"

245
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:23,167
and set the world on a different world line.

246
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:29,167
And when it happens, all memories
of the previous world line are erased

247
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:33,375
and replaced with memories
of the new world line...

248
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,958
The D-mail moved the
world from a world line

249
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:40,833
where Rukako didn't buy a
Loto 6 ticket to one where he did.

250
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:44,875
The world line changed, along with the past.

251
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:51,375
In this world, we never sent
the Loto 6 D-mail back in time.

252
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,458
So it isn't that they don't remember it...

253
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:59,417
...the experiment itself never happened here.

254
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:03,000
But then why do I still remember?

255
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:09,958
Crap!

256
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:14,208
Nae! Don't tell him I was
slacking off, no matter what he asks!

257
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,333
Can I ride your bike later?

258
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,125
Sure! Of course!

259
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,000
Okabe Rintaro!

260
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,917
I'm rooting for you!

261
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,542
Th-Thanks...

262
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:29,958
Bastard!

263
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,250
Dad!

264
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,500
Okabe!

265
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,458
What were you doing to my daughter?!

266
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,042
Huh?! W-Wait! I didn't do anything--

267
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:38,042
Shut it!

268
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:40,333
All alone with my adorable daughter...

269
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,333
Ain't no way a guy like
you could hold his lust back!

270
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,292
You're one to talk!

271
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:47,667
To begin with, we <i>weren't </i>all alone!

272
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:49,583
Suzuha was here the entire time too!

273
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,750
What?!

274
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,375
Is that true, Nae?

275
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,458
I promised I wouldn't
say she was slacking off!

276
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,083
What?!

277
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,167
Hey, part-timer!

278
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:03,167
--Oh, god...!
--You were goofin' off, were ya?!

279
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:05,833
What the hell?! The 42-inch is still in pieces!

280
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:09,667
I-I'm sorry!

281
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,750
I'll explain why later.

282
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:24,458
I'm calling off today's experiment.
Everyone please leave.

283
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,250
Okarin...

284
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,083
You there, Assistant.

285
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,042
You're not going to leave?

286
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:40,542
Just doing some thinking.

287
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:41,542
I see.

288
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:46,042
You want my company because
it's lonely back at the hotel...

289
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:49,667
--Isn't that so, Childish Celeb 17?
--Seriously, quit calling me that.

290
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:52,125
I have important e-mails to send.

291
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:57,875
If you insist on staying, be silent
and don't disturb me, The Zombie.

292
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:02,542
That's the name that irks me the most...

293
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,125
You're like a girl in love,

294
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,875
waiting for an e-mail from
the object of her affection.

295
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:22,000
Do you want my company that badly?

296
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:26,708
Who are you messaging?

297
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:29,500
John Titor.

298
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,125
Huh?

299
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,000
Daru?

300
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,750
Hello?

301
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,250
Oh, Okarin?

302
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,500
I just realized I made a grave error!

303
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,208
You did?! What is it?!

304
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:04,458
Well... You see...

305
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,375
I left my wallet back at the lab!

306
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,042
What?

307
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:09,875
Now I can't get into May Queen!

308
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,125
Okarin. I hate to ask--

309
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,292
Too-too-roo! Okarin!

310
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:18,333
Oh, it's you, Mayuri.

311
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:23,750
Daru's with you, isn't he?
You don't have to lend him money.

312
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,917
Okay.

313
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:27,583
Anyway, are you feeling any better, Okarin?

314
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,917
If you're not, you have
permission to hug Mayushii's Oopa!

315
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:34,250
That should cheer you up!

316
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
Heh, okay. I better go now.

317
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,208
Have a good day at work.

318
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,000
Thanks! Bye!

319
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,167
Okabe. You're smiling.

320
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:57,083
He replied!

321
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,125
I read your e-mail.

322
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,792
As you've surmised,

323
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:05,667
there is no doubt that you've altered
the past and moved the world line.

324
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:07,750
The one thing I don't understand

325
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:13,125
is how you still retain memories
of the past before it was altered.

326
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,208
Are you telling the truth?

327
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:19,333
I am. Something similar happened before, too.

328
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,875
What do you make of it?

329
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,542
I don't know.

330
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:25,542
The idea of using e-mail to alter the past

331
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:30,375
was never considered
in the year 2036 I'm from.

332
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:35,083
You've now altered the past
and caused the world line to move.

333
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:39,125
However, until now,
no one has ever been known

334
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:45,083
to maintain their memories across
world lines and observe their changes.

335
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,375
Even so...

336
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:50,375
Kyouma. It might be
that you have that ability.

337
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,958
You might be the one person
who can guide the world...

338
00:20:56,958 --> 00:21:00,708
...beyond 1% divergence.

339
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:06,167
"Guide the world"?!

340
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:09,417
What does "beyond 1% divergence" mean?!

341
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:12,042
What exactly is there?!

342
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,583
Beyond it lies true freedom.

343
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:35,833
The future will always end in dystopia
unless that barrier can be crossed.

344
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,375
My goal is to change the future.

345
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:44,542
And you might have the
ability to make that happen.

346
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,917
Okabe? What's wrong?

347
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:51,750
What is he saying...?

348
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,667
Me, save the future...?

349
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:56,375
That's absurd...

350
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,375
Kyouma, I ask you...

351
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,125
...to be our savior.

00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:35,042
<i>With my vision restricted, there's no escape</i>

353
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:43,792
<i>from the merciless control of the twelve</i>

354
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:52,667
<i>Wishing for a tomorrow of repose,</i>

355
00:22:52,667 --> 00:23:01,375
<i>I embark for the horizon of the</i>
<i>sacred phenomenon in my hand</i>

356
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:10,000
<i>Trapped by the covenant and</i>
<i>shown the outline of false evidence</i>

<i>butterfly! I give myself to you</i>

359
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,167
<i>Oh, butterfly of tears,</i>
<i>dazzling butterfly! It's all...</i>

360
00:23:35,167 --> 00:24:02,070
<i>...about to be rewritten now</i>
