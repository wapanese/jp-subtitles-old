1
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,417
It has been five days since the space satellite

2
00:00:11,417 --> 00:00:15,500
crashed into the Radio Building in Akihabara.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,958
Throngs of people have gathered
again this morning to get a look at it,

4
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:22,000
but the satellite's country
of origin remains unknown

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,833
and it is unclear just
when it will be removed.

6
00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:49,625
Excuse me, do you have a moment?

7
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,500
Are you here today to see the satellite?

8
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,750
Could you tell us where you're from too?

9
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:30,875

Oh!

23
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,500
So <i>this </i>is a...!

24
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:55,958
It's great!

25
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,667
You've never had a beef bowl before?

26
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:02,083
Nope! I'd only heard about them!
They really taste great!

27
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:05,000
They're even <i>greater </i>with raw egg on top.

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,417
If you fancy yourself a warrior,
I suggest you become capable

29
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:10,292
of visiting beef bowl shops by yourself.

30
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,792
Well, Daru and I <i>do </i>come here often.

31
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:19,000
Just ask and we'll join you anytime.

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,417
Oh! I just remembered!

33
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:24,958
Okarin! You stiffed me with
the bill the last time we ate here!

34
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,708
Yes, that possibly might have happened...

35
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,292
Not "possibly"! "Definitely"!

36
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:31,583
Pay me back!

37
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,792
Unfortunately, I have no money on me today.

38
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:35,708
It's me.

39
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:39,750
Transfer the funds into my
Swiss bank account immediately.

40
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,917
What?! The Organization has hacked its way...

41
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:43,708
--...into the Geneva servers?!
--No cell phones.

42
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,542
--Damn! I can't believe this!
--Oh, it's just an act.

43
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:48,833
Too-too-roo!

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I didn't know you were with them, Suzu-<i>san</i>!

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,625
Yeah, I just happened to be on my lunch break.

46
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,542
You could've eaten with us
too if you'd come a little earlier.

47
00:03:57,542 --> 00:03:59,583
Then let's all eat there tomorrow!

48
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,083
--Okarin's treat!
--What's that?!

49
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,958
The Organization's sabotage will
keep the servers offline for a full week?!

50
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,375
Oh! It's Kurisu-<i>chan</i>!

51
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,583
Oh, Assistant. Did you get good rest last night?

52
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,792
Don't call me your assistant.

53
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,208
Hey, part-timer!

54
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:24,458
If your lunch is over, get back to work!

55
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,917
What's her deal?

56
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:30,250
A round table meeting?

57
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,500
--Aye.
--Whazzat?

58
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,708
A lab member meeting.

59
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,458
Have we ever done one before?

60
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:40,083
I don't even see a round table here...

61
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,458
Not a physical one.

62
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:45,250
But as lab members, there's a round
table within our hearts. Isn't that so?

63
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:50,750
So or not so, don't go putting
weird things in other people's hearts.

64
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,375
Do you think there's
one in Mayushii's heart too?!

65
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,750
Indeed, there is.

66
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,500
Really? I'm glad!

67
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,292
But what's a round table?

68
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:02,208
And <i>why </i>a round table?
Who are you, King Arthur?

69
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:05,833
I'm a limited-time-only lab member anyway.

70
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:09,000
Whatever the case, it's time
for a round table meeting.

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,125
We need to fill Mayuri in
on the situation now facing us.

72
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,750
Situation?

73
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:27,375
So, to beat SERN to the punch,
we must work as quickly as possible

74
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:32,000
to perfect the Phone Microwave
(Temporary Name)'s time machine functionality.

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,833
Oh? That's too complicated
for Mayushii to understand...

76
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,542
All you need to know is that SERN is evil.

77
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:43,000
What do you mean by "perfect" it, though?

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,042
We've already successfully
sent messages back in time.

79
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:48,125
Only twice!

80
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:53,292
And we still don't know what
conditions trigger the phenomenon.

81
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:59,208
With the last experiment, it only worked
when there was an electrical discharge.

82
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,083
That's it!

83
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,250
Did you figure something out?

84
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,875
No, "Mail Sent to the Past" is too hard to say.

85
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:09,792
Let us first begin by
figuring out a name for them.

86
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:10,625
Huh?!

87
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,042
--Not <i>more </i>parenthetical names!
--Don't give that tone!

88
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:15,042
No one mocks the
great Hououin Kyouma and--

89
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,708
You just want to come up
with another absurd name.

90
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,125
How rude! Then I'll tell you!

91
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,958
I've named the phenomenon of
sending e-mails to the past thusly!

92
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:27,875
I dub it "Nostalgia Drive"!

93
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:35,125
Incidentally, it's written with the
characters for "nostalgic journey across time,"

94
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,500
but it's read as "Nostalgia Drive."

95
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,708
Too complicated. Rejected.

96
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,875
Hold on! Assistants
have no authority to reject--

97
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,750
Let's vote on it, then.

98
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,875
Who's for "Nostalgia Drive"?

99
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,625
Mayuri! Daru! You backstabbers!

100
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,292
I think Kurisu-<i>chan </i>is right.

101
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:55,875
Mayushii can't remember such a long name.

102
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,250
You're majorly delusional, man.

103
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,083
I think we should focus on keeping it simple.

104
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:04,542
Since it's going against the flow
of time, "Contrari-Mail" sounds nice.

105
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:08,292
--What's "contrari"?
--That's hardly simple at all.

106
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:12,083
It should clearly be "The Mail
That Leapt Through Time."

107
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:15,375
--No, that's too stiff and hard to say.
--You're in no position to talk.

108
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,292
Your "Nostalgia Whatever"
was long too, you know!

109
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:20,417
It has romanticism! That's all that matters!

110
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:22,458
Then I'll shorten it to "Time Leaper."

111
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,208
That doesn't tell you <i>what </i>leaps through time!

112
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:28,375
An e-mail? A girl? Bananas?

113
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,917
Too-too-roo!

114
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:32,042
Mayushii has a name too!

115
00:07:32,042 --> 00:07:35,083
It's... "Back to the Mail"!

116
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,625
That means you're going back
to the e-mail. That makes no sense.

117
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,625
Then "DeLorean Mail"!

118
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,958
That makes even less sense!

119
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,583
Say...

120
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:47,708
Why don't we just go with
that and shorten it to "D-mail"?

121
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,708
Oh! That sounds good!

122
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,292
It's decided then.

123
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:56,000
We will now begin our D-mail
(Temporary Name) experiments.

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We can drop the "(Temporary Name)" part too.

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,083
This will be known as Operation Urd.

126
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,417
We don't need that, either.

127
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:05,875
But we don't know what causes
the D-mail phenomenon to occur,

128
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,958
or what the electrical
discharge has to do with it.

129
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,750
That's precisely what we're about to find out.

130
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,042
I, Hououin Kyouma, have a hypothesis.

131
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:20,375
We've overlooked the simplest
and most crucial condition of all...

132
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,458
Namely, the time they occurred!

133
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,333
The first D-mail was sent
between noon and 1:00 pm.

134
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,167
The second occurred at around 6:00 pm.

135
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:31,542
In other words, if we re-conduct
the experiment at those times,

136
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:34,333
it <i>could </i>occur again! ...Maybe.

137
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,750
That's way too simple if you ask me.

138
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,000
But it's worth trying.

139
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,542
Mayuri! Bring a banana!

140
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:43,167
Mayushii is getting low on bananas...

141
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:45,167
Is it really necessary to insert the banana?

142
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:46,917
"Insert the banana!"

143
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,792
Daru. This isn't the time.

144
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:51,417
We need to see if it turns
into a "jellyman" or not.

145
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:53,708
Now, hurry, Assistant. Put the banana inside.

146
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,042
"Put the banana inside!"

147
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:57,875
Knock it off, you pervert!

148
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:02,125
Sorry. I'll buy you a new one later.

149
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,042
Really?! I'm so happy!

150
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:08,708
Okarin and Daru<i>-kun never </i>buy me any.

151
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:09,958
Sheesh...

152
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,167
Oww!

153
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,375
--Drop the cute and clumsy act.
--I'm not acting!

154
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,417
Pain, pain, fly away!

155
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:18,708
Thanks, Mayuri.

156
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:22,583
Quit making a Yuri Field over
there and help set up the D-mail!

157
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:23,417
Yeah, yeah.

158
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:26,292
Is 120 seconds on the timer okay?

159
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:27,292
Aye.

160
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:30,250
Commence Operation Urd!

161
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,250
Now!

162
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,417
Yes... Yes!

163
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:51,167
Where's the banana?!

164
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,500
It turned into a gel-nana!

165
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,083
Ooh!

166
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,625
I finally figured it out!

167
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:03,917
Just as I thought, the time of day is
a key part of the D-mail phenomenon!

168
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:08,125
Good thinking, Okabe. It was
so simple it never occurred to me...

169
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,542
Feeling vexed?

170
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:13,542
Your recognition of my praiseworthiness
is nonetheless admirable.

171
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:16,125
Anyway, has the D-mail arrived?

172
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,000
Yeah, it worked.

173
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,125
It arrived five days ago.

174
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,375
Did you send two messages, Miss Makise?

175
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,875
No. Only one.

176
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:30,083
It's been split into two messages!

177
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:33,167
What does this text mean, anyway?

178
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,458
Look it up yourself.

179
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,667
Say, come to think of it,
our D-mail the other day

180
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:45,292
was split into multiple
messages too, with part of it cut off.

181
00:10:45,292 --> 00:10:48,042
That one went back five days too.

182
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:51,583
Yeah. Must be some sort of physical law-- Oh!

183
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,083
Which means that message...

184
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,333
...called me a no-brained idiot?!

185
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,625
Took you long enough.

186
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:02,583
How dare you, Christina.
Trying to sneak your insults--

187
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,875
Whoa, why are you buying so much?

188
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,667
Nonperishable cup ramen
is all the food we need.

189
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,125
And one bag of the
cheap chocolate is enough.

190
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,208
But it's to celebrate the experiment's success--

191
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,625
Just put it back.

192
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,083
Tightwad.

193
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,458
That's right...

194
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:37,750
I was so excited by the experiment's
success that I almost forgot

195
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,750
that we learned SERN's terrifying secrets

196
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,583
and that we've dragged Mayuri into it too...

197
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,375
Is this really a good thing?

198
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:03,083
Oh, it's you, Shining Finger.

199
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:08,167
What?

200
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:15,417
What are you doing?

201
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:18,083
You... don't have your phone?

202
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:22,417
Hououin Kyouma's cell phone is
not here, for it is currently being used...

203
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:25,958
--...in a truly historic experiment.
--All set. Oh...?

204
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,875
O-O-Okarin!

205
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:31,708
This wood-inducing-- I mean, sexy 3D girl...

206
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,708
Just who might she be?

207
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,583
Yes, allow me to introduce you.

208
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:39,250
This is Shining Finger, Kiryu Moeka.

209
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,250
N-Nice to meet you, Kiryu--

210
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:52,708
There was a short time when
even I had hope for the 3D world...

211
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,708
Oh! Yo!

212
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,458
Are you guys making merry or something?

213
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,625
Indeed.

214
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,125
We're conducting experiments
that will go down in history--

215
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,625
That's nice and all...

216
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,333
...but my boss is <i>really </i>ticked off.

217
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,125
He says all the shaking
upstairs is getting out of hand.

218
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:17,250
"I'll raise your rent 10,000 yen,
dammit!" and stuff like that.

219
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,833
10,000?

220
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,083
All right, I'll handle this.

221
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,083
Daru. Go tell my assistant to
halt the experiments for a while.

222
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,083
Roger.

223
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:29,125
Remember the eye of the tiger...

224
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:32,292
Is Makise Kurisu still up there?

225
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:35,583
Oh, yeah. You glared at her again earlier...

226
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,833
Just what's your deal with her?

227
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,750
Did something happen in the past?

228
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,375
No, nothing in the past.

229
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,458
Yes. It was the summer you were eight.

230
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,167
The red-eared slider that got away
on that dry Mississippi riverbed--

231
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:53,250
Nothing happened! I never met her before!

232
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,708
Never mind that--I'd go
apologize to my boss if I were you.

233
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:03,292
What the hell are you guys doing up there?

234
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:06,500
You've been shakin' the whole
damn place for a while now...

235
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,208
Actually, we're conducting
the experiment of the century

236
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,125
that will rewrite the history of science.

237
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:15,042
But you needn't worry,
for we're done for today--

238
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:21,042
I told her to stop!

239
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,167
What are you doing?!
I told you to stop the experiment!

240
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,000
Miss Makise said she
wanted to do one last one...

241
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I sent you an e-mail. Did you not get it?

242
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,708
Of course I did not!

243
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,708
--I warned you five days ago, too.
--Quit screwing around--

244
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,708
Oh, actually, your cell phone rang a lot

245
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:43,083
even when we weren't running experiments.

246
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:51,125
--Why won't she just talk to me?!
--What's wrong?

247
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,458
I don't know either, but I think
he's not getting enough calcium.

248
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,792
I'm not the one to blame here!

249
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:57,917
Well, it doesn't matter much now,

250
00:14:57,917 --> 00:15:01,208
since I got enough data to mostly
figure out how these D-mails work.

251
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,833
What?!

252
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:10,667
One second on the timer equals
one hour backward in real time.

253
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:14,125
So 120 seconds equates to 5 days in the past.

254
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,125
Is it me, or is it awesome that she's discovered

255
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,042
how to control how far back it goes?

256
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:21,708
But we can only send a
maximum of 36 English characters,

257
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,583
or 18 Japanese characters.

258
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,917
That's not enough. I'd like to improve on that.

259
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:30,750
I guess you can't send
big stuff or lots of stuff, huh?

260
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,792
Oh, I bet it's because that Carb black hole--

261
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:35,250
Kerr black hole.

262
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,208
Yeah! I bet that hole is too tight!

263
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,125
Could you repeat that
part about the hole, Mayushii?

264
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,583
Knock it off, pervert!

265
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:46,583
At any rate, we'll figure out the
details tomorrow and afterward.

266
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,750
But I <i>will </i>proclaim this!

267
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:55,292
August 2, 2010 is a day that
will forever go down in history!

268
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:56,542
For on this day,

269
00:15:56,542 --> 00:16:01,792
our Future Gadget Laboratory
has successfully developed mankind's...

270
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:04,542
...very first time machine!

271
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,500
But it's <i>not </i>the first. SERN
already made one, remember?

272
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,833
Besides, we didn't "develop" anything.

273
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,917
We only got it to work by accident.

274
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:19,542
How dare you all make light
of my majestic declaration...!

275
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:21,500
--But, Okarin...
--Yeah?

276
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,083
I'm glad your experiments worked out!

277
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,083
Where am I?

278
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:53,250
You aren't moving.

279
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:59,583
Time and space have switched places here.

280
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,417
An event horizon?

281
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:07,250
You can't move through space,

282
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,542
while time stretches forever.

283
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:14,917
One second for you will be an eternity for me.

284
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:16,667
The ends of space are drawing away?

285
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:20,042
No, it's being pulled away!

286
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:22,042
<i>What </i>is, though? The universe?

287
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,458
Me?

288
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,833
You must not look back.

289
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,458
Eternity isn't infinite.

290
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:35,875
Even if time stretches
toward eternity, an end still exists.

291
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:45,042
When will it be one second later?

292
00:17:45,042 --> 00:17:46,875
Look forward.

293
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,083
Reach it.

294
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,583
You must not look back.

295
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,792
Not that spammer girl again...

296
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:05,292
She's as persistent as ever...

297
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,792
"Sorry about yesterday."

298
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:11,167
"Can I come over?"

299
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:14,292
Did you not think maybe I was <i>asleep</i>?

300
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:19,667
Don't give me "oh"! Of course I was!

301
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:22,042
What?

302
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,833
Why are you e-mailing me?
I'm like right here!

303
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:43,917
I'm not reading it. Tell me to my face.

304
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:46,917
You can see it; I just wasn't
expecting you this insanely early--

305
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:51,708
Aha! You want an interview
with me! That's your aim, isn't it?!

306
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,750
Why won't you talk?

307
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,292
I see. So <i>that's </i>your deal.

308
00:18:56,292 --> 00:19:03,167
You're terrified of mad scientist
Hououin Kyouma's evil aura!

309
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:07,583
I feel more comfortable... sending messages...

310
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:13,500
So... please show me... the IBN 5100...

311
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,833
Very well.

312
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,667
But you only get to <i>look</i>.

313
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:20,208
Once you've seen it, you leave! All right?

314
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:38,542
Maybe she's just really into retro PCs?

315
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:44,458
Anything but my face.

316
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:48,417
Photograph my face and
I'll be forced to silence you--

317
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,792
"I'd like to borrow it--is that okay?"

318
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:56,583
"If you could help carry it--"

319
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,125
Why am I suddenly lending it to you now?!

320
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,250
Besides, if you really want to borrow it,

321
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,833
you can at least ask me to my face.

322
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:08,500
Will you let me borrow it?

323
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Unfortunately, I can't.

324
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,292
I'm only borrowing it for a short while myself.

325
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:18,750
Once I'm done with it, I have
to return it to its original owner.

326
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,958
Its original owner?

327
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,500
Yanabayashi Shrine.

328
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,333
Guten Morgen!

329
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:29,083
Oh! Aren't you Miss Kiryu from yesterday?

330
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,292
Oh, I didn't introduce you yesterday, did I?

331
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:36,208
This is my favorite right arm,
Daru the super hax0r.

332
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,583
Seriously, dude, it's "super <i>hacker</i>."

333
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:42,625
Oh, anyway, I'm thinking of
improving the Phone Microwave a little.

334
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,292
It's a real hassle to set everything up

335
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:48,750
to send D-mails to the past, y'know?

336
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:55,958
I-It's nothing at all. You misheard.

337
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,417
He didn't say, "...sending mails to the past."

338
00:20:58,417 --> 00:21:01,542
He said, "Sen ding ma ilsto thep ast."

339
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:04,917
In archaic, ancient Sumerian, it means,

340
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:07,375
--Too-too-roo! Good morning, Okarin!
--"Have you had breakfast yet?"

341
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,375
Can Mayushii use the microwave
to heat her chicken tenders...

342
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,417
--...before you do your time machine experiments?

343
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:15,833
Okabe. I had a realization
about the time machine...

344
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:19,542
It's me.

345
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:21,125
The situation is ugly.

346
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,667
No, not that.

347
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:25,042
Information about #8 has
been leaked to an outsider.

348
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:27,000
--Yes. I'll handle it somehow.
--What's going on?

349
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,833
--He's fancifully ignoring all three of us?
--Yes, I'll silence her if necessary.

350
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,708
We cannot let the Organization learn--

351
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,917
Don't mail me while I'm on the phone!

352
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:37,042
You don't mean...?

353
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,958
FB?

354
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:58,542
All right. I'll spill the beans.

355
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:01,083
Now that you know our
secret, I'm left with no choice.

356
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,667
Kiryu Moeka.

357
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:06,875
As of today, you are Lab Member 005!
