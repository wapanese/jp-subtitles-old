00:00:08,417 --> 00:00:10,292
If we return to the beta world line...

00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:13,375
If we undo that D-mail...

3
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:15,250
...you'll die.

There you are.

You'll get heat stroke if you stay up here.

19
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:03,417
So? You're always lying on the roof of the lab.

20
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:05,167
Besides, it's cloudy out.

21
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,083
Did you find Mayuri?

22
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,875
Hashida didn't see her at Comima.

23
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:14,208
Yeah. I saw her afterward.

24
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,833
I see.

25
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,708
Say, Okabe...

26
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,333
Yeah?

27
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,125
All right.

28
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:36,958
Hey.

29
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,875
It's raining.

30
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,958
W-WTF!

31
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,542
You could've said something sooner.

32
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,042
Even my underwear's soaked. Sheesh...

33
00:02:58,042 --> 00:02:59,833
I <i>did </i>tell you.

34
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,542
It's your fault for not paying attent--

35
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,375
You pervert!

36
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,625
I didn't mean to look!

37
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,917
You're the one who chose
to wear such thin clothing--

38
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:17,500
I'd forgotten that you're a pervert!

39
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,708
Do you honestly think your
scrawny, naked body is that--

40
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:24,583
Say any more and I'll turn your
cerebral neocortex into pickle juice!

41
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:28,000
--What kind of threat is that?
--Get away from me!

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,125
What's that?

43
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:31,375
Oh.

44
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,542
Must've torn it somewhere
while looking for you...

45
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:35,458
What a klutz!

46
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:38,208
M-My class is a "mad scientist"--

47
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,625
Uh-huh. You're nothing
but trouble, you know that?

48
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:42,625
Give it here.

49
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:46,083
I happen to have a sewing
kit with me. I'll fix it for you.

50
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,167
A sewing kit?

51
00:03:48,167 --> 00:03:51,500
Believe it or not, I'm decent at home-ec stuff.

52
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,542
Now take it off.

53
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:59,708
Just as a heads-up, it's dark in
here, so don't expect too much.

54
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:04,000
And you'll have to wait until we're
outside to see what color the thread is.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,792
Black, red, or pink...

56
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:07,917
Each has a one-out-of-three chance.

57
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:10,333
I'll just pray I don't get pink.

58
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,458
Hey--! Stay away.

59
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,875
Don't worry. I've no interest
in seeing your scrawny, naked--

60
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,375
I told you. Pickle juice.

61
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,417
Sheesh...

62
00:04:21,417 --> 00:04:25,625
Where did you even get a rip like this anyway?

63
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,167
Well, today I went to the lab...

64
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:29,583
The laundry...

65
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,125
For a walk...

66
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:34,500
And then the hotel you're staying at.

67
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,375
You went to the hotel?

68
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,417
Don't blame me.

69
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:43,125
You wouldn't reply to my
messages or answer my calls.

70
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,208
Wait, were you actually worried--?

71
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:50,167
It's my job as the head of the
lab to look after my assistant.

72
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:57,167
--Aren't you done yet?
--Hold on.

73
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:58,292
Catch!

74
00:04:58,292 --> 00:04:59,875
Brr! Hey...!

75
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,083
Just put it on.

76
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:05,333
I've no interest in seeing a mad
scientist's scrawny, naked body, after all!

77
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,000
I bet it was right around here, huh?

78
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:25,250
The place where I was stabbed...

79
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,625
How do you know that...?

80
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,000
Just as I thought.

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,125
The pain and desperation
felt too real to be just a dream...

82
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:40,375
Kurisu... Don't tell me you...!

83
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:46,542
Yeah. I have hazy memories inside me, too.

84
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:51,542
Faint memories... Almost like illusions...

85
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:54,833
Not just of being stabbed.

86
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:59,125
I have faint memories of you, too.

87
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,625
You're desperate to save Mayuri...

88
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:07,958
You keep pushing
forward, all alone and hurt.

89
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,750
You're never able to re-right the world...

90
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,125
Yet you desperately fight.

91
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,958
You desperately call out Mayuri's name...

92
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,042
And cry.

93
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:21,833
I see you struggling so hard to save her.

94
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:26,542
Every time I see that look on your face...

95
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:32,250
I realize how irreplaceable Mayuri is to you.

96
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:37,333
I realize it's possible for someone
to care about someone else so much...

97
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:44,292
It made me want to work with you...

98
00:06:44,292 --> 00:06:47,208
It made me want to help you.

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,583
Listen, Okabe.

100
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,583
Save Mayuri.

101
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:01,875
You <i>have </i>to save her.

102
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,250
What about you?

103
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,333
If I go to the beta world line...

104
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,167
...you'll die!

105
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,083
But... it's the only option.

106
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,958
You know that more than anyone.

107
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,292
There's only one choice.

108
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:22,292
You want--

109
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:23,875
You want me to just abandon you?

110
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,042
What other way is there?

111
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:32,042
I've gone over it since yesterday.

112
00:07:32,042 --> 00:07:35,375
I thought I could find <i>some </i>way
around it, some sort of solution,

113
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:38,292
just like all those other times...

114
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,833
But it's no use.

115
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,625
This time there really is no other option.

116
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:46,625
The only way is to go the beta world line.

117
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,125
Okabe!

118
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,250
I refuse to accept this...

119
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,000
I refuse to give up!

120
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:06,083
There's no way I can just abandon Kurisu.

121
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:09,083
I can't just let her die and then move on...

122
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,625
What would the point be in that?!

123
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,875
I...

124
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,250
I...

125
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:32,625
Running will...

126
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:36,417
Running will only make it worse!

127
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,333
Shut up!

128
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:44,333
Time-leaping <i>won't </i>get you over
the 1% barrier, however hard you try!

129
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,167
We don't know that for sure!

130
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:50,417
You'll only end up watching Mayuri die!

131
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:52,375
Again and again...

132
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,667
It'll break you!

133
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,792
It won't.

134
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:01,292
Do you know how many times
I've seen Mayuri die already?

135
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,750
I've seen it again and again...

136
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,167
And again, and again, and again...

137
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:10,792
...and again, and again...

138
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:15,333
It won't break me now!
It doesn't matter how many times--

139
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,208
Do you know what you're saying?

140
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,750
Mayuri is going to keep suffering and dying!

141
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,917
You can't be okay with that!

142
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:32,583
If that <i>doesn't </i>affect you...

143
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:37,042
...then your heart is already broken.

144
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:42,583
Stop this. It really will destroy you...

145
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,500
I know.

146
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,583
I've realized it for a while.

147
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:51,792
I stopped being shocked as
Mayuri kept dying and dying.

148
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:56,458
At some point, my heart grew numb to it.

149
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,458
Sometimes I even waited to time leap

150
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,917
just to find out her precise time of death.

151
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:06,625
At some point, I stopped
being affected by her deaths...

152
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:14,625
Some part of me would
casually say I could just redo things...

153
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,458
Save Mayuri...

154
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:28,417
Otherwise it really <i>will </i>break you.

155
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:32,375
If you let Mayuri die, you <i>will </i>regret it!

156
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:37,333
The wish to save her is what's
brought the two of us this far!

157
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,333
If you give up now, you'll
regret it for the rest of your life.

158
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,583
But if I save Mayuri, you'll--!

159
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,083
I'll just go back!

160
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,500
To the initial world line
where the D-mail was never sent!

161
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,667
It's what's best for me... and for you!

162
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:03,750
We've fought so many
times over these twenty days...

163
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,917
We've said nasty things to each other.

164
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,583
We've shared our problems.

165
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:13,417
Whenever I was a in a bind,
I turned to Kurisu for help.

166
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:19,167
It was Kurisu who quietly
listened to me and believed me...

167
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:23,125
A girl prodigy who published
a scientific paper at 18.

168
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,875
Always calm, always headstrong...

169
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,333
Always full of pride and nosy...

170
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:31,167
So indulgent that she's diligent...

171
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:35,917
Her theories always mesmerized me.

172
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:38,917
I remembered every word she said...

173
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:43,750
And watched every move she made...

174
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,250
She's not just a fellow lab member.

175
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,875
To me, Makise Kurisu is...

176
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,333
I...

177
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,625
...can't save you...

178
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,458
I'm sorry...

179
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:10,667
Thank you...

180
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:15,417
For suffering so much for me...

181
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:19,542
Why you?

182
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:23,417
Why'd it have to be you?

183
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:28,667
Say, what <i>does </i>it mean to
change world lines anyway?

184
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:32,958
Who knows, maybe you'll
completely cease to exist in this world line

185
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:37,417
the moment you go to the beta world line...

186
00:12:37,417 --> 00:12:40,833
Or maybe you'll switch
places with a different Okabe.

187
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:44,958
It doesn't matter.

188
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,583
That's not true.

189
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,667
I won't have died.

190
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,542
Even if I'm dead in the beta world line,

191
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:54,958
there's no guarantee I'll die here!

192
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,708
Maybe there are doubles of
me on countless world lines.

193
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:03,000
Maybe all their minds are
connected, forming a single "me."

194
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:08,375
That sounds wonderful, don't you think?

195
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:13,250
Being in all times and in all places.

196
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,000
A strong love for someone...

197
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,417
A strong belief in something...

198
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:20,792
A strong wish to convey something...

199
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:25,583
If all those things go
beyond time to create "you"...

200
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:28,958
...then that would be magnificent.

201
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,833
So don't think of it as "letting me die."

202
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:38,792
Even if the world line changes,
as long as you don't forget me,

203
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:40,833
I'll always be there.

204
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,833
So...

205
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:46,708
I'll never forget you.

206
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:55,458
I could never forget the
person I care about the most.

207
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,708
Is that...?

208
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:57,500
It's the truth.

209
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,125
Wh-What...?! This is so sudden!

210
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:05,167
I love you.

211
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:06,667
What about you?

212
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,625
Wh-What do you mean?!

213
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,125
I want to know.

214
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:13,917
How do you feel about me?

215
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,333
You really want to know?

216
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,333
Yeah.

217
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,167
Your face...

218
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:22,583
Close your eyes.

219
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,792
What for?

220
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:26,000
Just close them!

221
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:59,292
I-I didn't do that because
I want to, just so you know.

222
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:00,375
It's just...

223
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:05,042
Intense experiences accompanying
certain actions--such as your first kiss--

224
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:07,625
are stored in the hippocampus
and thus harder to forget.

225
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,208
--So I thought--
--Too bad.

226
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,458
That wasn't my first kiss.

227
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:17,208
--You stuck-up virgin!
--Shut up, untouched maiden.

228
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:22,417
My first kiss wasn't romantic at all, though.

229
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:26,000
Still, this one wasn't enough to be memorable.

230
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,875
Let's do it over.

231
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:31,583
I don't want to forget. I need to be extra-sure.

232
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,000
Okay?

233
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,542
I-I guess so.

234
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:37,667
Just a kiss, though.

235
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:47,208
Time is passing by so quickly...

236
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:52,000
I almost want to complain to Einstein right now.

237
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,750
You know, Okabe...

238
00:15:53,750 --> 00:16:00,458
Time speeds up or slows down
depending on a person's perception.

239
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,958
The theory of relativity...

240
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,375
It's so romantic...

241
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,750
...and so sad.

242
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:17,292
Well, this is it.

243
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:19,500
Are you sure about Mayuri and Daru?

244
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,583
Having everyone see me
off would only hurt more.

245
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:26,750
If it's just you, I can leave Japan
without any hesitation whatsoever.

246
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,208
I'm joking.

247
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,083
A gift for you. Take it.

248
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,667
I don't want this...

249
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:39,958
It's been upgraded to Version 2.67.

250
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,083
How annoying.

251
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,292
But I'll accept it anyway.

252
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,083
Well...

253
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:55,000
--Kurisu--
--Oh, yeah.

254
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,208
A gift in return!

255
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,583
What were you aiming for?!

256
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,083
Just go get it.

257
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,708
Yeesh...

258
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:35,958
Okabe...

259
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:40,750
I'm sure that, from now on,
you're going to suffer.

260
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:48,125
You'll be in a world where no
one but you remembers me...

261
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:51,542
You care about your friends
more than anything else...

262
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:53,750
...so I think it'll be painful for you.

263
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,125
I'm sorry.

264
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:03,375
But that pain will mean a lot to me.

265
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,583
Whenever you're sitting around in the lab...

266
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,750
Whenever you sip a drink...

267
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,500
Whenever you walk around town...

268
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,875
Whenever you kiss someone someday...

269
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,458
It doesn't have to be every time.

270
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,708
One time out of a hundred is fine.

271
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,292
All I ask is that you remember me...

272
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:25,167
Because I'll be there...

273
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:30,000
I'll always be there, beyond the 1% barrier.

274
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:32,875
Okabe...

275
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:34,917
Okabe...

276
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Okabe...

277
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,208
Whoa! I found it, Okarin!

278
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,917
I totally found it! This is it, right?!

279
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:54,417
If we delete this...

280
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:56,375
Mission complete?

281
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,375
Are you okay, Okarin?

282
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:03,458
I'm fine.

283
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:08,667
The final phase of Operation
Verdandi will now commence!

284
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,750
Our victory has come!

285
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,500
After fending off the
many plots against us and...

286
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,583
...and holding true to our convictions...

287
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:21,375
...we have, at long last,
prevailed in the battle of Ragnarok!

288
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:27,667
I am grateful to my friends who
fought to make this victory a reality!

289
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:32,417
I am grateful for all the
sacrifices that had to be made...!

290
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:36,542
What awaits now is the world I sought...

291
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:41,625
A world entirely chosen by Steins Gate!

292
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,583
The world will now...

293
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,917
...be reconstructed!

294
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,458
Kurisu...

295
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,042
I'm sorry...

296
00:19:56,042 --> 00:19:57,583
Okabe!

297
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,792
Okabe... I feel...

298
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:07,875
Kurisu!

299
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:11,000
I feel the same! I love--

300
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,792
Mayuri...

301
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,667
Who's Lab Member 004?

302
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:32,292
004?

303
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,292
We don't have a 004.

304
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:47,333
The battle of Ragnarok is now over!

305
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:51,375
I, the mad scientist Hououin Kyouma,

306
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,667
faced with assaults mounted
by the Organization <i>and </i>SERN,

307
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:58,542
have achieved complete victory by
manipulating time and space itself!

308
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:01,042
The world's power
structure has been reset,

309
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:03,708
and a future of chaos awaits!

310
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:07,375
<i>This </i>is the choice of Steins Gate!

311
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:11,167
Okarin. It's okay now.

312
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:15,458
What? I just delivered
a grand victory speech...!

313
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:19,292
You don't have to talk that way anymore.

314
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:22,583
Mayushii's okay now.

315
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:27,208
So now you can cry for yourself, Okarin.

316
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,792
We don't need the
Phone Microwave anymore.

317
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:38,375
It was because of this
machine that I met Kurisu.

318
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:42,500
But it was because of this machine

319
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,250
that so many people were hurt.

320
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:49,042
Just as Hououin Kyouma has died...

321
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:52,500
...so, too, must the Phone Microwave.

322
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:58,625
Life isn't about doing things over.

323
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,917
This is for the best.

324
00:22:00,917 --> 00:22:04,333
Right, Kurisu?

325
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,875
Hello?

326
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:12,958
Huh? Wh-Who's this?

327
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,500
"Dad"?

328
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,833
What's that? Okarin?

329
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:20,500
Okarin! Some mystery girl wants to talk to you!

330
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,417
Who's this?

331
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:24,167
Please! Come to the roof of
the Radio Building right away!

332
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:25,875
Huh? Who are you?

333
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:28,625
I'm from the year 2036!

334
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:31,583
I'm Hashida Itaru's
daughter, Amane Suzuha!

335
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:33,583
Suzuha...?

336
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:36,750
Hold on! What are <i>you </i>doing here?!

337
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,333
Please! Believe what I have to say!

338
00:23:39,333 --> 00:24:02,006
You have to stop World War III!
