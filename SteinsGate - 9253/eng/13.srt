1
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:11,208
SERN will take your time machine now.

2
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:13,750
SERN?! What do you mean?!

3
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:16,333
Makise Kurisu...

4
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,750
Okabe Rintaro...

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,458
Hashida Itaru...

6
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,875
You three will come with us.

7
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:27,125
Wh-What about Mayuri...?

8
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,542
Shiina Mayuri...

9
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,833
...is unnecessary.

10
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,042
Stop...

11
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:42,083
Please stop...!

12
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,958
For FB...

13
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,750
FB... FB...!

14
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:11,208
Mayuri...

15
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:12,917
Mayuri!

16
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,167
Mayuri...

17
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,500
What is this?!

18
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:35,458
Get away from her.

19
00:01:37,917 --> 00:01:39,292
Okabe!

20
00:01:39,292 --> 00:01:42,708
Get away! Before she kills you too!

21
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:47,458
I'll get you for this...

22
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:50,542
She was my...!

23
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,667
The 42 inch CRT...

24
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,417
It's on now.

25
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:33,583
Hurry!

26
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,333
Okabe!

27
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,500
I'll go!

28
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,042
But if this doesn't work...!

29
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,875
Just hurry!

30
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,000
Okabe!

31
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:59,625
Leap!

32
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:22,917
<i>For you, billions and billions of heartbeats</i>

33
00:03:22,917 --> 00:03:29,583
<i>are nothing at all; just the blink of an eye</i>

34
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:34,792
<i>Although I'm trapped by</i>
<i>the past and lament the future</i>

35
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:40,708
<i>inevitability won't allow for</i>
<i>even a speck of a miscalculation</i>

36
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:46,833
<i>Our dreams and futures that</i>
<i>form and expand into "infinity"</i>

37
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:52,667
<i>allow us the right to be vain,</i>

38
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:58,917
<i>while the two hands</i>
<i>point out what is "finite"</i>

39
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:03,500
<i>All of which leads to a cruel</i>
<i>contract and choice to make</i>

40
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,750
<i>Hacking to the Gate</i>

41
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:12,667
<i>So, now, with each passing</i>
<i>second, I'll cross world lines</i>

42
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:17,583
<i>to protect that smile on your face</i>

43
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:24,583
<i>Then, once again, into a</i>
<i>time loop without sadness</i>

44
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:31,250
<i>I will be swallowed up as a lone observer</i>

45
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:47,292
Mayuri's grandmother died when
Mayuri was still in grade school.

46
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:57,167
Mayuri would visit her grave
every day for the next six months.

47
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:01,500
With her grandmother's
pocket watch in hand,

48
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,167
she would always,
always, gaze up at the sky.

49
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:10,958
Almost as if she was waiting for
her grandmother to come get her.

50
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:16,375
Then, one day, there was a light.

51
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,917
Crepuscular rays...

52
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,458
Sometimes known as an "Angel's Ladder."

53
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,542
It almost seemed like it was
about to take Mayuri away.

54
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:39,167
It seemed like she was
about to vanish forever...

55
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:40,792
Mayuri!

56
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:46,875
Okarin?

57
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,000
I won't let you get taken away.

58
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,292
You're my hostage.

59
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:54,417
You're my living sacrifice
for my human experiments.

60
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:59,792
What came out of my mouth
was a line I picked up as a kid.

61
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:08,792
A line a mad scientist inanely shouted
on a TV show we'd seen together.

62
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:10,417
Oh.

63
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:18,917
So Mayushii is Okarin's hostage?

64
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:22,375
Then I guess that's just how it is...

65
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,917
What's with you?

66
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:44,500
Did you doze off or something?

67
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,708
--What time is it?!
--Huh?

68
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,958
--What time is it?!
--What's your problem?

69
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,833
It's almost 5:00.

70
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,250
We're going shopping, remember?

71
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,167
Shopping?

72
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:08,708
Okay, I'll order some pizzas then!

73
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,750
Thanks! Just no Hawaiian pizzas, please.

74
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,792
--I can't stomach them.
--Agreed.

75
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:18,625
The time leap worked...?

76
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,542
Okabe.

77
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:20,542
Mayuri!

78
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:21,708
Where's Mayuri?!

79
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,125
What brought <i>that </i>on?

80
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:30,750
Mayushii just left, remember?
She went to invite Miss Ruka to the party.

81
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,208
Are you going shopping?

82
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,875
The development conference is canceled!

83
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,458
Canceled? Why?

84
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,875
Did something happen?

85
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:42,917
We're done for today!
Both of you, go home immediately!

86
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:44,917
--What are you talking about?
--Just go!

87
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:46,833
Got it?! Just do as I say!

88
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,750
What's <i>his </i>deal?

89
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,000
His phone rang, and then suddenly he's all...

90
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,708
His phone?

91
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,583
Too-too-roo! This is Mayushii!

92
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,167
I can't come to the phone right now.

93
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:06,000
Please leave your message--

94
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:15,000
The world line hasn't changed much,
unlike whenever we send D-mails.

95
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,083
I've really gone back to 5:00 pm today...

96
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,792
Clackety-clack!

97
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,167
Bullet train!

98
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:26,625
No, honey, bullet trains are white.

99
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:31,917
After this, Mayuri brings
Suzuha to the lab and...

100
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:35,833
Should I go to the police?!

101
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:40,708
No, no one would believe that
I've time-leapt from the future!

102
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,250
I have to do something
within the next three hours!

103
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,917
Mayuri! Mayuri!

104
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:49,333
O-Okab--

105
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,958
I mean, Kyouma--

106
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,917
Where's Mayuri?!

107
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:56,125
--She already left...
--She left?! When?!

108
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:59,250
A-About half an hour ago.

109
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,542
She said she was heading back to the lab.

110
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,833
Is she not back yet?

111
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,500
Umm, I'm sorry.

112
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,125
It was very nice of you to invite
me to your party, but today I have to--

113
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,208
Any mention of stopping by somewhere first?!

114
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:15,000
You mean Mayuri-<i>chan</i>? No...

115
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,583
If you see her, have her call me right away!

116
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,167
O-Okay.

117
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:24,375
If the world line hasn't changed,

118
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:28,958
then neither will Mayuri's actions--
unless I can change them somehow!

119
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,875
Where is she?!

120
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,125
Meow, meow!

121
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,708
Faris can't come to the
phone right now, meow!

122
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,292
Please leave your message at the--

123
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,250
Where are you, Mayuri?

124
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:48,167
Mayuri?!

125
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:50,083
Sorry to disappoint.

126
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,917
It's you, Assistant...

127
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:54,333
I told you we're done for today. Leave at--

128
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,792
Just answer me this.

129
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:59,542
You time-leapt from the future, didn't you?

130
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:04,458
How did you know?

131
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:08,708
It was like you completely changed
the instant you answered your phone.

132
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,708
Given your behavior,
I take it something's happened?

133
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:16,208
Yeah. But I don't have time to explain now.

134
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,458
Just run.

135
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,292
Where to, though?

136
00:10:19,292 --> 00:10:22,583
Anywhere. Just as far
from the lab as possible!

137
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,167
Got it?

138
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:27,458
--You <i>better </i>explain later.
--I will.

139
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,917
Tell Daru, too.

140
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:30,542
All right.

141
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:31,625
Okabe.

142
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,208
Yeah?

143
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,833
Don't do anything crazy, okay?

144
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,125
I know.

145
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,875
Okabe Rintaro!

146
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:47,500
--Hey, which way is Ochanomizu--
--Have you seen Mayuri?!

147
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,542
Shiina Mayuri?

148
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:52,042
Yeah, she just invited me to your party--

149
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:55,708
--Where?!
--Turn right at that corner--

150
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,083
Hey! Which way is Ochanomizu?!

151
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:01,125
I'm supposed to take
Nae there to go shopping!

152
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,958
Just ask a policeman!

153
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,667
Also, when you take her
there, do <i>not </i>come back!

154
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:07,167
Why not?!

155
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,792
I'll explain later!

156
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,042
Mayuri...

157
00:11:26,042 --> 00:11:27,042
Mayuri!

158
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:28,917
Oh, Okarin!

159
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:31,708
Look! The first star of the night!

160
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,667
--Wh-What's going on?!
--Just come with me!

161
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,583
Huh? What about the party?

162
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,958
It's canceled!

163
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,667
I've already told Kurisu and Daru!

164
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:41,208
Huh? How come?

165
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,833
I'll explain later!

166
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:46,958
But I already invited Suzu-<i>san,</i>
and Daru-<i>kun </i>ordered pizza--

167
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,042
Just do what I say!

168
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,875
Okarin...

169
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:56,333
Sorry.

170
00:11:56,333 --> 00:12:00,417
Mayushii doesn't understand...

171
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:04,042
You always do things
she doesn't understand,

172
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:08,125
but today you're <i>really </i>hard to understand.

173
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:12,000
I guess... you wanted to
do the experiment after all...

174
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,792
Mayuri...

175
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:19,375
That's not true.

176
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:22,875
But, please, listen to me for now.

177
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:26,333
There's no time.

178
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:29,625
I promise I'll explain later.

179
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,000
Okay.

180
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,833
Sorry. Mayushii was just really shocked...

181
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:39,000
Don't apologize.
You haven't done anything wrong.

182
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:48,542
Look at all these people...

183
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:51,208
Yeah, it's rush hour.

184
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:55,708
Oh? But the platforms are empty...

185
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:02,875
Again, a bomb threat has shut down
all trains on the following lines...

186
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,333
They still don't know when
the trains'll be running again.

187
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,667
--Urgh! What a pain!
--How could I be so careless...

188
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:08,958
...at a time like this?!

189
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,625
--Okarin?
--Mayuri!

190
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,000
The subway! Hurry--!

191
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,583
Okabe Rintaro, I presume?

192
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:20,667
What's wrong?

193
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,125
You're coming with us.

194
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:29,917
Hey! Don't block the way! Move!

195
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:31,542
Run!

196
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:39,167
Run!

197
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:40,875
As fast as you can!

198
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,042
Who are they?!

199
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:46,917
Okarin!

200
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:48,292
Get out of here!

201
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:50,208
Run, Mayuri!

202
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:13,083
The deceased is Shiina Mayuri.

203
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:17,542
Okabe-<i>kun</i>-- I mean,
Okabe Rintaro has been secured.

204
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:19,833
Mayuri!

205
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,500
Damn you!

206
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,625
I won't let you kill her!

207
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,708
I <i>will </i>save you, Mayuri!

208
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,500
I will!

209
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,208
I swear it!

210
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:46,083
Canceled? Why?

211
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,625
Did something happen?

212
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,375
Yes. You see...

213
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:55,125
I have intel that Mr. Braun will
be storming the place tonight.

214
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,250
Okarin. Did you get into trouble again?

215
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,542
Yes. You know how it is.

216
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:03,375
--But what about Mayuri?
--I'll tell her myself.

217
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,042
In any case, it's dangerous to stay here.

218
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:07,917
You're dismissed for today!

219
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,042
Was that too forceful?

220
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:17,083
No... I don't care if
I seem suspicious or not.

221
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:21,250
What matters most is getting
everyone away from the lab!

222
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,542
Too-too-roo! This is Mayushii!

223
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:27,083
I can't come to the phone right now.

224
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:33,083
This keeps taking me too long!

225
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,250
It's going to be just like last time!

226
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,083
I have to find Mayuri somehow...!

227
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,042
--Hello?
--Rukako!

228
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:46,542
It's me! Okabe!

229
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:49,000
Oh, Okabe-- I'm sorry.
I mean Kyouma-<i>san</i>!

230
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,042
--Mayuri!
--Huh?

231
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:51,125
Is Mayuri there?!

232
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,083
Oh, Mayuri-<i>chan</i>?

233
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,167
--Yes, she's leaving--
--Stop her!

234
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:59,792
Tell her to absolutely
stay put until I get there!

235
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,458
--But she's going to the lab--
--Just do it!

236
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,792
R-Right!

237
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,542
Mayuri-<i>chan</i>!

238
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,292
Clackety-clack!

239
00:16:10,292 --> 00:16:12,292
Bullet train!

240
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:16,125
No, honey, bullet trains are white.

241
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,208
Mayuri!

242
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:22,708
Oh, Okarin! Too-too-roo!

243
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,583
Are you okay?

244
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:30,708
I was just about to fix Fubuki-<i>chan</i>'s
costume and head back to the lab...

245
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:33,542
Fubuki-<i>chan</i>? A cosplayer friend of yours?

246
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:34,250
Yeah!

247
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:39,083
She just texted about some loose
threads in the costume Mayushii made--

248
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,375
So <i>that's </i>where she was?

249
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:45,333
I'll go straight to the lab when I'm done!
I'll make it in time for the party!

250
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,417
Wait! The party is...

251
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:50,417
The party is cancel--

252
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:53,375
--...It's been postponed.
--Huh?! How come?!

253
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:56,583
We can't use the lab, you see...

254
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,542
It's out of our hands.

255
00:16:58,542 --> 00:16:59,958
Oh...

256
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:04,000
Anyway, I need you
to come with me, Mayuri.

257
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,458
Right now.

258
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,250
--What about Fubuki-<i>chan</i>?
--Sorry, but she'll have to wait.

259
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,542
This is extremely important.

260
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:12,042
Umm, did something happen?

261
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:15,708
Yeah. We're going on a little outing now.

262
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,042
--A trip.
--Huh?!

263
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:19,500
Th-Th-The two of you are?!

264
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,333
Oh, I mean...

265
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:26,417
I can always go see Fubuki-<i>chan</i>
tomorrow, but this is so sudden...

266
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:29,667
--Where are we going?
--I'll tell you later.

267
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:31,333
We have a train to catch.

268
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:35,125
But Mayushii hasn't packed,
and we'll need money--

269
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,208
Don't worry about that.

270
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,625
Now let's go.

271
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:42,500
Oh! Wait, Okarin!

272
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,042
Umm...!

273
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:46,792
--Huh?
--B-Be safe.

274
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:49,625
Yeah! See you soon!

275
00:17:55,292 --> 00:17:59,000
Isn't Akihabara's train station over there?

276
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,083
We're taking the subway.

277
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,708
Oh.

278
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:22,542
It's been so long since you last
walked with me in tow like this!

279
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:24,167
Yeah.

280
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:39,625
--Let's turn back.
--Huh?

281
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,083
All right. Let's go!

282
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,792
Just Kurisu...

283
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:25,000
Huh? Mayushii's watch has stopped...

284
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,250
That's strange.

285
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,542
I wound it up just a little while ago...

286
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,667
It sure is crowded.

287
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:37,667
They shut down the Soubu Line.

288
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:40,250
Huh? They did?

289
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,833
Yeah.

290
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:46,208
Apparently they got a
phone call about a bomb.

291
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,833
Oh...

292
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,875
Say, Okarin.

293
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:59,042
Umm, Mayushii has lots of things to ask you,

294
00:19:59,042 --> 00:20:01,583
but she'll hold them in for now, okay?

295
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:09,083
Just promise you'll explain
everything when this is over.

296
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,792
Yeah.

297
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,292
I promise.

298
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:21,583
--I'm sorry.
--Huh?

299
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:26,500
I'm sorry I'm not very useful to you.

300
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:35,792
Let's hold that party someday.

301
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,125
Yeah.

302
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,750
Someday.

303
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,875
Someday...

304
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,500
...for sure.

305
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,167
Big Sis Mayuri!

306
00:21:42,292 --> 00:21:44,125
...mean to...

307
00:21:45,542 --> 00:21:47,417
I didn't mean to...

308
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:55,083
All I wanted was to surprise her...

309
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:06,667
I won't let her be killed...

310
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:11,583
I<i> will </i>save Mayuri...

311
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,250
I <i>will</i>!

312
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:35,167
<i>With my vision restricted, there's no escape</i>

313
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:43,917

314
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:52,792

00:22:52,792 --> 00:23:01,500
<i>I embark for the horizon of the</i>
