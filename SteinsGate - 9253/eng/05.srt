1
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:27,042
Hey, part-timer! Need ya up front!

2
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:28,583
Right!

3
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,750
I never said that!

4
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,208
Did too! You said taking
breaks would be more efficient!

5
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:39,417
<i>You're </i>the one who
has to rest every few steps!

6
00:00:39,417 --> 00:00:41,750
That was meant to throw
the Organization off our trail!

7
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,042
--Get real. No one's coming after us.
--Okabe Rintaro!

8
00:00:46,042 --> 00:00:47,708
What's this?

9
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,042
Curious to know?

10
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:51,542
Under normal circumstances,
I'd be unable to tell you

11
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:55,000
as that information is top-secret. However...

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Come on! Put it down if
you're going to take a while!

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,417
Endure it, Assistant.

14
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:01,583
Then stop making a big deal
out of it and just tell her already!

15
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:04,625
Nonsense! This is an extremely important item!

16
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:07,667
If this isn't a big deal,
then I don't know what is!

17
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,875
Is it an IBN 5100?

18
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:10,833
Wha...?!

19
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:12,792
She knows, Christina!

20
00:01:12,792 --> 00:01:14,417
Where did you find it?

21
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:16,625
It was being kept at Yanabayashi Shrine

22
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:19,750
when I, the mad scientist
chosen by God, descended upon--

23
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,292
Talk or put it down! Choose one!

24
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:23,833
Makise Kurisu...

25
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,583
Huh? Y-Yes.

26
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,917
Who's she?

27
00:01:27,917 --> 00:01:31,333
A part-time worker at the CRT Work... shop...

28
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,375
Huh?

29
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:34,625
U-Umm...

30
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:43,667
Hey! Part-timer! Quit loafin' around!

31
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,000
Why was she glaring at me?

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,375
--'Cause you look sinister, obviously.
--Huh?!

33
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:21,875
<i>For you, billions and billions of heartbeats</i>

34
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:28,542
<i>are nothing at all; just the blink of an eye</i>

35
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:33,792
<i>Although I'm trapped by</i>
<i>the past and lament the future</i>

36
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:39,708
<i>inevitability won't allow for</i>
<i>even a speck of a miscalculation</i>

37
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:45,833
<i>Our dreams and futures that</i>
<i>form and expand into "infinity"</i>

38
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:51,667
<i>allow us the right to be vain,</i>

39
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:57,875
<i>while the two hands</i>
<i>point out what is "finite"</i>

40
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:02,458
<i>All of which leads to a cruel</i>
<i>contract and choice to make</i>

41
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,708
<i>Hacking to the Gate</i>

42
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:11,625
<i>So, now, with each passing</i>
<i>second, I'll cross world lines</i>

43
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:16,583
<i>to protect that smile on your face</i>

44
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:23,583
<i>Then, once again, into a</i>
<i>time loop without sadness</i>

45
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:30,250
<i>I will be swallowed up as a lone observer</i>

46
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,500
Wow, it's so big!

47
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,625
It's almost like a tiger rug!

48
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,583
It's like a futon!

49
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,000
Mayushii is lying on my shirt...

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,208
The sight of it sets my heart ablaze!

51
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,458
Okay! Put it down slowly.

52
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:56,750
--You don't have to tell me!
--Kurisu-<i>chan</i>!

53
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,792
I'm sorry for visiting out
of the blue like this again.

54
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:02,667
No, you can come anytime you like!

55
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,542
You're a lab member, after all!

56
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:07,750
I distinctly recall her stating
yesterday that she'd <i>never </i>come back.

57
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,333
You're a capricious one, all right.

58
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:13,875
I'm not here because I want
to be! <i>You </i>asked <i>me </i>for help!

59
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,917
Huh?! You mean you don't like it here?

60
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:20,333
Huh? Oh, no, it isn't that.
It's not that I hate it here...

61
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:23,125
So, what's in the box?

62
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,417
Curious to know?

63
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:27,292
--Under normal circumstances--
--An IBN 5100.

64
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:29,333
Seriously?! Sweet!

65
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,000
Okarin FTW!

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,708
He does what we can't,
with the greatest of ease!

67
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:37,250
--All his base...
--...are not belong to me.

68
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,417
A-Anyway, let's boot it up!

69
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,833
We found it thanks to Mayushii, you know!

70
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:49,208
Yes. You deserve all the credit this time.

71
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,000
It works!

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So now can you analyze that programming code?

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,417
Easier said than done.
I don't know how to use this thing.

74
00:05:00,417 --> 00:05:05,708
It was built long before the Internet,
so there's no way to hook it up to anything.

75
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:09,000
For now, I'll need these parts.

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,708
All right. You heard him, Assistant.

77
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,958
Please stop calling me that as if it were fact.

78
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,667
--You <i>are </i>my assistant.
--Am not!

79
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:22,833
You go, Okarin. I doubt she
knows Akiba well enough anyway.

80
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:23,917
Oh, all right.

81
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:25,125
Mayuri! Let's go!

82
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,125
Mayushii will stay here

83
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:33,250
and focus on showing Kurisu-<i>chan</i>
around the lab so she'll like it!

84
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,333
Christina! Curse you!

85
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,125
--Don't tell me you've charmed Mayuri too!
--I've done nothing of the sort!

86
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,458
Miss Makise seducing Mayuri...

87
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,333
Yuri development FTW...!

88
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,833
Stop imagining things, pervert!

89
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,792
It's nice for girls to be
together, don't you think?

90
00:05:46,792 --> 00:05:49,833
A-Anyway, could you show me around?

91
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,000
Okay!

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,167
Then we'll start with the
shower room in the back!

93
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:57,583
Huh? There's even a shower here?

94
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:58,750
Yeah.

95
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,417
But sometimes the hot water
gets cold if you use it for too long,

96
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:03,708
so be careful!

97
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:08,000
Wait... Do you actually use this sometimes?

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yeah, once in a while!

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,708
Please! Promise me you'll
never shower here again!

100
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,958
--It's too dangerous!
--Don't look at me!

101
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,708
It's practically suicide...

102
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,083
Why are you even here, anyway?

103
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:23,667
Did he blackmail you or force you
into becoming a member somehow?!

104
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:27,042
Mayushii is Okarin's hostage.

105
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,458
--I think I need to call the police.
--Wait!

106
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,458
She just said she's your hostage.
That's irrefutable evidence.

107
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,917
It's not like that.

108
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:42,375
Mayushii <i>chose </i>to be his hostage!

109
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,000
Huh?

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,375
What does she mean?

111
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,250
--I'm off.
--Bye!

112
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:55,208
I'm <i>fairly </i>certain this will
work as a suitable replacement...

113
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,250
'Sup!

114
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,250
How's the IBN 5100? Seem useable?

115
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,708
Shh! Don't speak that name here!

116
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,292
Oh, you're gathering parts?

117
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,208
Want some help?

118
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:12,208
I never would've imagined a part-time
warrior would know so much about PCs.

119
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:16,917
Yeah, I used to know an IBN expert.

120
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:20,417
Really?! Then please
put me in touch with them!

121
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:22,583
I can't.

122
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,500
If you refuse, be prepared
to experience hell on earth!

123
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,958
Really, I can't.

124
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,750
Don't you value your life?!

125
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,667
I can't... because he's dead.

126
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:35,083
He died years ago.

127
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,292
My apologies.

128
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:40,542
No, I should apologize for earlier...

129
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:42,625
Has my assistant done something wrong?

130
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,750
No. Nothing at all.

131
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,750
Did she glare at you first or something?

132
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,625
Oh, did she scoff at you too?

133
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,667
No. She hasn't done anything.

134
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:54,500
Then...

135
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:02,292
She doesn't know anything yet.

136
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:05,125
But beware of Makise Kurisu.

137
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,125
What does that mean?!

138
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:11,917
An air raid?!

139
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,125
They're broadcasting the fireworks.

140
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,667
I'm pretty sure it's today.

141
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:19,500
Fireworks... Fireworks...

142
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,667
Oh, I've heard of those!

143
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,667
Huh? You've never seen any before?

144
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:26,875
Where are they?! Which way?!

145
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:30,000
Follow that street toward the
river and you should see 'em.

146
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,958
Thanks!

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,875
Give me your e-mail address!

148
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:40,667
A festival?

149
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:43,125
It's a fireworks display!

150
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,583
Fireworks, huh...

151
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,000
Want to go see it?

152
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,292
Huh? N-No, not really...

153
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:52,500
Oh! Okarin!

154
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,167
Too-too-roo!

155
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,833
--Heading home?
--Yeah!

156
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,750
--Did you find the parts?
--All right here.

157
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:04,083
I see. I take it you're
going to try things out now?

158
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,708
Interested?

159
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,000
You are, aren't you?

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,458
Urgh, all right! Just a little!

161
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:14,833
But I'm not interested in any of
your SERN conspiracy nonsense!

162
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:18,083
I simply want to know the truth.

163
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,708
--I'm sorry.
--What for?

164
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,042
I'm going back to the laboratory after all.

165
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:24,833
Oh. Mayushii is going home, then.

166
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,458
Okay.

167
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,917
--Kurisu-<i>chan</i>?
--Hmm?

168
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:32,292
You'll visit again, right?

169
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:36,250
Yeah. I'm a member until
I return to America, after all.

170
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah!

171
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,917
Bye!

172
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:42,000
What absurdity was that?

173
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,625
You're my assistant;
of course you'll come to the lab.

174
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,042
She said you're childhood friends.

175
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:54,125
How did you grow up in the same
environment yet end up so socially inept?

176
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,500
Yes, Mayuri's always been a little "off."

177
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,708
I'm referring to <i>you</i>!

178
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:03,750
"Here's my first e-mail!

179
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,208
Better than I imagined!

180
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,417
Fireworks are amazing!"

181
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,042
Oh? It hasn't worked once since then?

182
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:20,042
I'm borrowing this.

183
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:26,750
I feel so much calmer in a lab coat!

184
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,292
Yes!

185
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:30,500
My judgment steered me right!

186
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,125
You're perfect!

187
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:35,083
Wh-What's going on? You're creeping me out...

188
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,458
A lab coat!

189
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:40,208
Inside a research organization,
a lab coat is a uniform!

190
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,792
I keep telling that to Daru and Mayuri,
but they just don't understand.

191
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:45,708
But you do!

192
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,792
Now, then! Let us stand together
with our hands in our pockets!

193
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:50,833
--Huh?
--Quickly!

194
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,167
--L-Like this?
--Yes!

195
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:55,208
This is a pose of intelligence and ecstasy

196
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:58,708
given off only by those who
dedicate their lives to research!

197
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,833
--That lab coat is my gift to you.
--Itchy...

198
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:04,000
Let us enjoy them together
to our hearts' content!

199
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,333
I can't help but feel you're insulting me--

200
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,083
Hungry, are we?

201
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:14,208
Sh-Shut up. I haven't eaten since lunch.

202
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:18,792
Very well, then. I'm feeling charitable today.

203
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,000
--Kindly shove it down.
--Are you serious?!

204
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,833
--Dissatisfied?
--Of course I am!

205
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,917
Don't you have anything else?

206
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:28,708
We <i>do </i>have some cup ramen.

207
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,625
But I doubt someone raised
in America would <i>ever </i>want--

208
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,250
Cup ramen?

209
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,250
I'll have that.

210
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,458
What flavors do you have?

211
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,542
Soy sauce and salt!

212
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,458
I'll have the salt flavor.

213
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,292
...And a fork.

214
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:53,583
Better hurry before
time runs out and you lose.

215
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:57,083
Maybe you should give up? You clearly
have a virus card at the end there.

216
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,875
It's too obvious.

217
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,625
Feel free to believe so.

218
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,583
Then I'll just put this here and...

219
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:08,583
There. Check.

220
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:13,792
Oh? You enjoy Dk Pepper, Assistant?

221
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:15,958
Well, I <i>did </i>spend seven years in America.

222
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,167
I bet we'll make great drinking buddies!

223
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:22,000
Sorry, but I'm underage.

224
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,083
I meant Dk Pepper drinking buddies.

225
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,667
Just that one drink?

226
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:28,667
That gives it true significance.

227
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:32,292
Together we can share our passion
for Dk Pepper, the intelligent drink!

228
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:37,583
Could you stop trying to peek
under my card as you say that?

229
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:44,292
Okay, I win.

230
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:49,708
I have to be honest--you lack the
ability to see the big picture, Okabe.

231
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,958
You only focus on your own strategy;

232
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,875
you never consider what your opponent
is thinking or if something's a trap.

233
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:00,667
--Seriously, you--
--Hold on!

234
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:01,708
What?

235
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,333
What did you just say?

236
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,292
Th-That you lack the
ability to see the big picture.

237
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:09,375
I-It's the truth.

238
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,000
Before that!

239
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,333
You said "Okabe"!

240
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,667
So?

241
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:19,750
I know I'm younger than you, but since
you have no sense of respect as it is--

242
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,250
No!

243
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,917
I am Hououin!

244
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:28,042
How many times must
I repeat myself, Christina?!

245
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:30,708
From now on, you <i>will </i>call me Hououin!

246
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:35,042
Or Kyouma...

247
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,208
Are you crying?

248
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,625
No!

249
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,917
I wasn't terrified of a scary man yelling at me,

250
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:50,375
thereby causing me to
cry afterward out of relief!

251
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,208
That didn't happen at all!

252
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,083
Daru. Why is my assistant crying?

253
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,500
I believe she just told you why.

254
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:07,792
Let's see... This goes like so and... Huh?

255
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:14,875
Then, if this goes here...
Ah, it goes like this.

256
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,417
Assistant.

257
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:18,292
I'm not your assistant, but what?

258
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:21,417
Perhaps you should return
to your hotel for the night?

259
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:23,792
--It's nearby, right?
--Don't worry.

260
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:26,167
I'm leaving if it doesn't work by morning.

261
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:28,583
Shouldn't you contact your family or something?

262
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,083
My mother's in America,

263
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,000
and I haven't seen my father in seven years.

264
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,833
Thus I have no one to contact.

265
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:37,250
Ah, so you're a <i>prodigal </i>perverted genius girl.

266
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,708
Quit adding weirder things to it.

267
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,125
I got it...

268
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,708
I got it!

269
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:46,500
You did it?!

270
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,542
Mission Complete II!

271
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:49,667
So what did you find?!

272
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:51,333
I haven't checked anything yet.

273
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,750
But here's that "Z-Program" thing...

274
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,875
It says 1973?

275
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:57,917
Yeah...

276
00:14:57,917 --> 00:15:01,292
--When was SERN founded?!
--1954.

277
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:05,917
--When was the IBN 5100 made?!
--1975.

278
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:08,958
Meaning SERN implemented
a special programming language

279
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,875
in the IBN 5100 solely for this project?!

280
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,458
That's a little <i>too </i>farfetched.

281
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,042
But it <i>is </i>possible!

282
00:15:15,042 --> 00:15:18,458
We'll know for sure once
we read this report, right?

283
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:21,083
I bet it's just an old
report about particle physics

284
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,708
and nothing conspiracy-related at all.

285
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:27,500
WTF, a JPEG file?!
I can't copy-and-paste that!

286
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,333
Oh, it's not in French...

287
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:33,542
Let's see... "Space-time Control
and its Destruction of History..."

288
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:36,417
Oh, right! You can read English, Miss Makise!

289
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:37,958
Good work, Assistant!

290
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:41,833
All the time you spent in
America was entirely for this moment!

291
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,750
Get real.

292
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,667
Let's see...

293
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:48,583
"In other words, creating a
utopia spanning from past to future

294
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:52,958
will be the purpose of SERN's
existence in the 21st century."

295
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,375
A utopia...?!

296
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,708
Dystopia!

297
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:59,292
That can't be right! Skip these
intro remarks and go to the main text!

298
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,000
I think <i>you'll </i>have to find it...

299
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,875
Let's see...

300
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,208
"As this is a classified experiment..."

301
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,250
That's not it.

302
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,000
"Those working on the program..."

303
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,125
That's not it, either.

304
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,125
Here!

305
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:12,125
"The Z-Program will test the
feasibility of spatiotemporal transferal

306
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,708
through the use of
high-energy proton collisions."

307
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,625
Spatiotemporal transferal?

308
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,417
They mean time travel!

309
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:22,292
--You can't be serious!
--No, it's true!

310
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:24,917
Just as I thought, SERN's been
conducting time travel research

311
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,125
for over forty years now!

312
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,750
Wait! Let's not jump to conclusions!

313
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:34,167
"Program Stage 1: construction and
application of the Large Hadron Collider."

314
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:38,167
"Program Stage 2: practical
application and tuning of the lifter."

315
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:39,750
What's a "lifter"?

316
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:45,000
Remember all that hubbub a long
while ago about "ionocrafts" or whatever?

317
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,292
Let's see here...

318
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:47,375
It's floating?!

319
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:51,083
It apparently occurs when running a
high-voltage current through aluminum.

320
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,708
What does that have to do with time machines?

321
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,750
I don't know, but that's what it says here.

322
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,917
In other words, it uses the
power of a black hole and a lifter.

323
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:01,333
What else does it say?!

324
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,458
"Program Stage 3: animal experiments."

325
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:07,000
"Program Stage 4..."

326
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,417
What is it?!

327
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:12,458
"...Human experiments."

328
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,750
"Human is dead. Mismatch."

329
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,958
What?

330
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:20,042
We found that in an
e-mail when we first hacked in.

331
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:21,667
After that, didn't it say...

332
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:24,542
"The details are in Jellyman's Report."

333
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:26,833
Can we see that report, Daru?!

334
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,875
I think so, but is it really a good idea?

335
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:33,583
If this is real, it's totally
top-secret, confidential stuff!

336
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,917
<i>Now </i>you're scared, after coming this far?

337
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:38,458
Think about it. This is SERN we're dealing with.

338
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:42,000
And this is a top-secret report,
hidden away for the past 40 years.

339
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,042
Then you're <i>not </i>going to read it?

340
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,542
You need to leave.

341
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:48,625
Huh?

342
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:52,625
Learning any more than
this may put you in danger.

343
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,542
You're a genius with a
successful future ahead of you.

344
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:59,000
Wait... Are you worried about me?

345
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Of course I am!

346
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You're...

347
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,167
You're my assistant, after all!

348
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,583
Why, thank you.

349
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,042
But I'm not going anywhere.

350
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:09,458
I won't be able to sleep with this on my mind.

351
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,542
--You won't regret it?
--No.

352
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:12,833
What about you, Daru?

353
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,333
Well, I <i>am </i>a super hacker;

354
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,792
I can't imagine screwing up so
much they'd be able to trace us.

355
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:19,958
All right.

356
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:23,833
Then we will now commence our
analysis of the Jellyman's Report!

357
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:28,083
Additionally, I hereby dub
this operation "Laegjarn's Chest"!

358
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,792
Why Norse mythology?

359
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:32,417
In fact, why does it even need a name?

360
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:34,083
Daru! Commence operation!

361
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,542
Righty-o.

362
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:36,542
Is this it?!

363
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:41,125
Hmm, there are 14 files in all.
I'll just pick a random one.

364
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,917
"Jellyman's Report #10.

370
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,917
That again?!

371
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:57,917
"It is believed that the
subject was unable to withstand

--A newspaper article?
--Looks like it.

375
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:06,958
Look at the date!

00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:10,208
April 3, 1921!

man was squishy and jelly-like..."

379
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:29,833
WTF...?

380
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:34,458
Does it mean they've succeeded
in time travel, even if it isn't perfect?

Wanna see more?

403
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,500
No, I've seen enough.

404
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,250
Okarin...

405
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,958
I'm gonna get something to drink.

406
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:38,375
He's really shaken up.

407
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:41,625
Still, why did they all turn to jelly?

408
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:46,083
Judging from the data so far,
I think SERN is developing technology

409
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,875
to facilitate time travel via Kerr black holes.

410
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:56,167
If so, then they're shoving 10-24
kilograms into a 10-19 meter-wide space

411
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:58,875
to send it to the past.

412
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:02,417
It would be like trying to stick
this sponge through this hole.

413
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:06,125
Doing so "empties" what's inside...

414
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,208
Basically, it's a really tight fit?

415
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:11,792
Yeah. You're squeezing
into something really tight.

416
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:14,625
Whoa, explanations
don't get any dirtier than that.

417
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:17,875
Huh? What do you mean-- Huh?!

418
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,042
Hashida, you pervert!

419
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:22,458
I'd say you have quite the imagination yourself.

420
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,333
Don't put me on your level.

421
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,375
What do you plan to do?

422
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,250
Say something.

423
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,750
I know it comes as a shock,

424
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:45,458
but now that we know, we have
to reach <i>some </i>sort of conclusion.

425
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:50,333
Okabe?

426
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,250
Conclusion? There's only one conclusion.

427
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,042
Huh?

428
00:21:56,042 --> 00:22:00,667
We have Future Gadget #8, the
Phone Microwave (Temporary Name).

429
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:05,125
We'll build a flawless time
machine first, before SERN does!

430
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:09,583
And then we'll reshape
this world's ruling structure!

431
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,292
You're too much to deal with.

432

433
