1
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:16,708
World War III...

2
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:23,167
It results in 5.7 billion deaths
worldwide by the year 2036.

3
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:25,292
This is what starts it all.

4
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:27,250
This does? What <i>is </i>it?

5
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,125
Looks like a robot to me.
I bet it even transforms and stuff!

6
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,333
It's a time machine.

7
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,667
--Huh?!
--For real?

8
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,708
Impressive, Uncle.
You already know what it is.

9
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,292
That simplifies things, then.

10
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:42,417
You have to come with me.

11
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:48,500
I refuse.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,750
Okarin?

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,250
I came here from the alpha world line.

14
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,292
I've altered the world line over
and over these past three weeks...

15
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:02,792
...and only made it to this beta
world line by sacrificing Kurisu.

16
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:08,083
I can't just let it all go to waste now!

17
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,708
Kurisu-<i>san</i>...?

18
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,583
Kurisu...

19
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:14,750
Oh, wasn't that the name of that scientist

20
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,208
who got stabbed at the
Radio Building a while back?

21
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:23,583
Okabe Rintaro...

22
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:27,458
What if I told you avoiding a world war

23
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:34,542
requires preventing Makise
Kurisu's death on July 28, 2010?

24
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,333
What do you mean?

25
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,250
I don't know the details.

26
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,583
I have only one mission:

27
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:45,250
to rescue Makise Kurisu

28
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:50,208
and go to the only world line
free of attractor field interference...

29
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,250
...Steins Gate!

30
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,958
<i>For you, the assertion of</i>
<i>life and its meaningless proof</i>

31
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:18,625
<i>are so comical they don't</i>
<i>even help pass the boredom</i>

32
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:23,833
<i>Those of a foolish race,</i>
<i>acting as if they ruled over all,</i>

33
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:29,750
<i>presented a conceited, childish theorem</i>

34
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,917
<i>"Infinite" love and the far reaches of the sky</i>

35
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:41,750
<i>are part of a hypothetical</i>
<i>freedom we've been shown</i>

36
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:47,958
<i>"Finite" is the merciless march of time,</i>

37
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:52,542
<i>leading to a choice to deny even tomorrow</i>

38
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:54,792
<i>Hacking to the Gate</i>

39
00:02:54,792 --> 00:03:01,708
<i>The countless brilliant days</i>
<i>and promises made to my friends...</i>

40
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:06,625
<i>I must not "undo" any of it</i>

41
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:13,625
<i>So I'll use what tricks I have left to deceive time,</i>

42
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:20,333
<i>as a lone observer who no longer has doubt</i>

43
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,417
Steins Gate...

44
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:35,458
Your future self came up with this plan...

45
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,292
...along with Dad.

46
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:39,958
It's entirely conjecture.

47
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:43,292
It's possible that your theory is wrong

48
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:47,667
and there is no such thing
as a Steins Gate world line.

49
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:50,333
But I'm going anyway.

50
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:55,083
I'm going to bet on the unknown
chance that a bright future awaits.

51
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:58,500
And if you have it in
you to come with me...

52
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,458
...then take my hand.

53
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:14,042
Umm, Mayushii doesn't
understand anything you just said.

54
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:21,667
But if she--this Kurisu-<i>san</i>--is dear to you...

55
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:24,875
...then I think you should try.

56
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:29,833
This World War III stuff sounds
so much like your crazy delusions

57
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:33,625
that you're probably the
only one who can handle this.

58
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:39,625
I don't care about 5.7 billion
people in the future.

59
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,250
I just...

60
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:47,292
Thanks.

61
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:48,667
Climb in!

62
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:50,125
It can carry two people?

63
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:55,625
Of course! It's my dad's
greatest masterpiece, after all!

64
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,083
Okarin...

65
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,625
Leave your phone behind.

66
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:09,375
We can't risk interfering
with your phone in the past.

67
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:11,625
I'll be back.

68
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:15,042
Okay.

69
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:17,167
Good luck!

70
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:20,000
--So <i>this </i>is a time machine...
--Yeah.

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,708
It's in good, working condition.
I already stopped by 1975 and 2000.

72
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,542
It <i>is </i>starting to get low on fuel, though.

73
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:33,042
Huh? Wait, it can go forward in time too?!

74
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:35,958
Of course it can. It's a time machine.

75
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:40,417
I see. It must've been because
that was a different world line...

76
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:42,375
Sit down.

77
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,792
We're going to just before noon on July 28th.

78
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:49,208
I can't change our location,
so if we jump <i>too </i>far back

79
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:54,292
we risk causing a scene at the Radio
Building and altering Makise Kurisu's actions.

80
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:58,167
The G-forces are pretty
rough the first time, so be ready.

81
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:10,417
Okarin...

82
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,625
What are these?

83
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,000
They always appear.
They're like fragments of time.

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,833
Pretty, huh?

85
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,500
Let's go!

86
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,250
W-Wait.

87
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,458
My gastric juices are coming up...

88
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,750
Geez, you're a wimp.

89
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,375
Hurry up!

90
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:41,792
Try not to run into your other self.

91
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:44,375
It'll cause a major time paradox.

92
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,958
How long until she gets stabbed?

93
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,792
Twenty minutes, I'd say...

94
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:52,542
I'll go prep the time machine.

95
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:55,000
You protect her, Uncle.

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Stop calling me that.

97
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,917
July 28th...

98
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:03,083
The day I found Kurisu on
the ground, soaked in blood...

99
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:07,167
Mayuri and I had come here to see
Dr. Nakabachi's press conference...

100
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:09,708
Then we heard something on the roof...

101
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:25,667
That's right. Mayuri goes to the
Oopa machine on the 7th floor now...

102
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:27,042
Oh no!

103
00:07:27,042 --> 00:07:30,250
You called me here for <i>this</i>?

104
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,958
There aren't many in this series left...

105
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,708
--...but Mayushii's out of 100-yen coins.
--No other choice. I'll have to take
the far stairs back to the 8th floor.

106
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,917
--...but Mayushii's out of 100-yen coins.
--I'll have to take the far stairs back to the 8th floor.

107
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,875
It's a metal one! A Metal Oopa!

108
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,083
Is it rare?

109
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,458
Yeah! <i>Really </i>rare!

110
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,625
Should be safe now...

111
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,125
Oh, pardon me--

112
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,458
K-Kurisu...

113
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,792
Huh? How do you know my name?

114
00:07:57,792 --> 00:08:00,625
She's... alive...

115
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,792
Have we met before?

116
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:05,208
Kurisu...

117
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,250
Are you even listening--

118
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:10,542
What's your problem?!

119
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:13,042
Answer my question!

120
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,458
I'm...

121
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:20,625
I'm here to...

122
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:27,625
Dr. Nakabachi's conference is
about to begin in the 8th floor hall.

123
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,292
Wait! Stop!

124
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,833
You'll find the basic structure of a time
machine on the materials I've passed out.

125
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:43,792
As such, I'll use this time to explain
the fundamental theory behind it.

126
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:44,792
Scientists around the...

127
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:49,500
It said in the plans that you'd
be able to identify Makise Kurisu.

128
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,625
Can you?

129
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:51,500
Yeah.

130
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,375
I should also mention it'd be
dangerous to take her outside.

131
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,708
Without knowing who
killed her or how she died,

132
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,917
we should assume her
death is an inevitability.

133
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,792
Just like with Mayuri...

134
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:06,250
Doctor!

135
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,750
Oh, is something the matter?

136
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,667
Don't give me that! Your time
machine theory is what's the matter!

137
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:14,375
Kerr black holes! World lines!

138
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:17,125
All you've done is rip off--

139
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:20,583
Soon, this is where Kurisu will be...

140
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,792
Will she really come?

141
00:09:23,792 --> 00:09:27,042
Is it possible she gets stabbed
elsewhere but ends up here?!

142
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:30,333
Oh, I hadn't thought of that...!

143
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:37,792
Kurisu...

144
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,042
So this <i>is </i>where it happens...

145
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:44,917
What's that she's reading?

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,958
Time machines...?!

147
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:51,833
So <i>that's </i>why she's the
key to changing world lines...

148
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,250
Damn punk kid...

149
00:09:57,542 --> 00:09:58,875
What do <i>you </i>want?

150
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,542
Umm, I'd like you to read this...

151
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:02,542
...Daddy.

152
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:04,375
"Daddy"?!

153
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,250
Dr. Nakabachi?!

154
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,917
You contacted me for
the first time in seven years

155
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:13,792
and invited me to your
press conference, remember?

156
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,708
That's what inspired me.

157
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:19,167
--Don't tell me it's her father who...?!
--I did some brainstorming...

158
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:21,958
...and realized a time machine
might actually be possible!

159
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,625
I wanted to get your opinion, Daddy.

160
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:30,417
If it's accepted, you can show everyone
in academia who kicked you out--

161
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:32,500
I was not kicked out!

162
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,083
I got fed up with them and cut off all ties!

163
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,708
I'm sorry...

164
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:40,875
It's not bad.

165
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,167
Really?!

166
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:44,583
I was thinking, if you're okay with it,

167
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:47,750
that we could publish it
under both of our names!

168
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,208
After all, you helped inspire--

169
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,583
Don't be stupid!

170
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,458
--Go home!
--Huh?

171
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,708
I will publish this paper myself.

172
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:57,833
What...?!

173
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,958
You're going to steal it, Daddy?!

174
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:03,208
I was sure you'd never stoop <i>that </i>low--

175
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,000
Be quiet!

176
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,667
How dare you call me a thief...!

177
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:15,500
How are you so smart?!

178
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,833
A daughter shouldn't be
smarter than her father!

179
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:22,875
If it weren't for you, I'd still
be a distinguished scientist!

180
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,208
If it weren't for you...!

181
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,542
You're that kid...!

182
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:38,833
So <i>that's </i>how it is...

183
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:45,167
The two of you conspired
to ruin my press conference.

184
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,125
Now I see.

185
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,833
So <i>that's </i>how it is...

186
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,167
Daddy!

187
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:56,333
I have to protect Kurisu!

188
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,583
I'll teach you...

189
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,083
...to insult me!

190
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,958
Bastard...!

191
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:14,958
Stop this, Daddy!

192
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,458
Please!

193
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,958
Don't you dare...

194
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,667
--...tell me what to do!
--Crap!

195
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,833
You don't know anything!

196
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,583
This feeling...

197
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,000
This humiliation...

198
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
This living hell...!

199
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,125
Daddy...

200
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,000
If it weren't for you...

201
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,958
Stop...

202
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,500
If it weren't for you...!

203
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:43,292
Stop!

204
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:44,917
Daddy!

205
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,958
Kurisu...

206
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,208
K-Kurisu...!

207
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,083
Fools!

208
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,833
This is a fitting end for you two!

209
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:12,042
I'm sorry...

210
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,667
...for dragging you into this...

211
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,417
Why...?

212
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:17,500
Because he's my father...

213
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:22,000
I just wanted him... to accept me...

214
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,625
Kurisu...

215
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,083
I'm scared...

216
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,917
I... don't want to die...

217
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:39,125
I don't want to die...

218
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,167
I don't... want to...

219
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:46,292
Kurisu...

220
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,958
Kurisu!

221
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,208
They're back already!

222
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,375
Okarin!

223
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,250
...killed her...

224
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,292
--Okarin... That blood...
--I killed her...

225
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:19,208
--It's okay. It isn't his.
--I killed her...

226
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:25,958
I killed Kurisu... I killed Kurisu...

227
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:29,083
I killed Kurisu...

228
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,500
Okarin...

229
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,458
I know you're in pain,
Uncle, but you can't give up yet.

230
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,375
We have enough fuel
to go back one more--

231
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,000
Shut up!

232
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,417
It'd just end the same anyway!

233
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:45,583
The attractor field convergence
will always result in Kurisu's death...

234
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,708
Oh? It's Okarin's phone...

235
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:51,792
An e-mail?

236
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:52,750
Open it.

237
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,875
--But...
--Just do it.

238
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,958
"Turn on the news..."

239
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,583
The news?

240
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:09,167
Despite a fire in the cargo bay,
the airplane carrying Dr. Nakabachi

241
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:12,792
managed to land in Russia,
to which he recently defected.

242
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:14,792
Talk about a close call!

243
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:17,458
If this hadn't set off the metal detectors

244
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,208
my paper would've burned up!

245
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,500
--Oh! That's Mayushii's Metal Oopa!
--WTF?!

246
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,375
See! Mayushii's name is right there!

247
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,917
You're right! But what's it doing in Russia?

248
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:34,000
That paper is the start of it all...

249
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,792
Huh?

250
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:38,792
This pits the world's
superpowers in an intense race

251
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:40,708
to develop a time machine.

252
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:45,500
Because to control time is to control the world.

253
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Ultimately, it leads to world war.

254
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:54,167
The lives of 5.7 billion people are at stake.

255
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:56,417
Save Makise Kurisu!

256
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:58,542
Change the world line!

257
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,833
I can't.

258
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,750
It's just like what happened with Mayuri.

259
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,042
However hard I try, it'll always end the same...

260
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:08,833
With Kurisu dying.

261
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,208
How can you say that?!
You've only failed once--!

262
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,625
Once?!

263
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,583
Don't be stupid.

264
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:19,042
Do you know how many times--how
many <i>dozens </i>of times--I failed?!

265
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:22,250
I know.

266
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,583
I know how insane this time loop is...

267
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:30,083
I know how cruel of a fate it has in store...

268
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,125
I knew...

269
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:39,375
I knew this would happen...

270
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,500
I'm tired...

271
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,250
I've had enough...

272
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,667
You aren't the type of person
to give up halfway through!

273
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:53,833
Mayushii knows that!

274
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,917
You <i>never </i>give up!

275
00:16:56,917 --> 00:17:00,833
Even when Mayushii couldn't
say goodbye to her grandma,

276
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:04,875
you never stopped coming
to her grave every day!

277
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,792
That's what helped me say goodbye!

278
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:11,750
That's what helped Mayushii get better!

279
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,875
So... you <i>can't </i>give up.

280
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,375
You should've received
a video file on July 28th.

281
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,208
July 28th...

282
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,833
You should be able to view it

283
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:35,542
now that you've failed
once in saving Makise Kurisu.

284
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:37,500
What do you mean?!

285
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,333
I'm sorry for misleading you.
Failing once was part of the plan.

286
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,708
It was so you could see this.

287
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,208
Is this...?

288
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,833
Greetings...

289
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,333
...me from 15 years ago.

290
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,000
It's Okarin!

291
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,500
If you've opened this message,

292
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,208
then that means you've
failed to rescue Kurisu.

293
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:09,250
It must've been painful for you.

294
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,667
But that pain also gave me determination.

295
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:18,083
So I couldn't afford to undo it.

296
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:22,000
It helped paved the way, you could say.

297
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,875
Now we can move to the real focus of our plan.

298
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:30,583
The plan is this: save
Makise Kurisu and enter Steins Gate.

299
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,167
There are two conditions.

300
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:37,417
You <i>must </i>destroy the
paper on time machines

301
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:40,792
that Dr. Nakabachi takes to Russia.

302
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:44,333
You must also save Makise Kurisu.

303
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,458
If I could do that--!

304
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:51,125
The thing is, avoiding her
death and altering the past

305
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:54,000
is impossible due to
attractor field convergence.

306
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,667
Right?

307
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:59,625
I'll just say it. It <i>is </i>possible to save Kurisu.

308
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,833
You're just going about it the wrong way.

309
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,750
Now listen closely.

310
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,458
You must <i>not </i>alter established past events.

311
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:12,167
You must <i>not </i>undo what your first self saw.

312
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:17,375
Doing so would alter
the past. All would be lost.

313
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,208
Think back to your
experiences on the alpha world line.

314
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,083
It was only three short weeks,

315
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:28,875
but you should have memories of
the time you spent with Makise Kurisu.

316
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:37,958
Of the many sacrifices you
both made trying to save Mayuri.

317
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:43,000
All the time you spent
adrift in those world lines...

318
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,500
It mustn't go to waste.

319
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,625
You must not undo it.

320
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,833
It's because of that journey
across countless world lines

321
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:55,792
that you're there, hoping to save Kurisu.

322
00:19:55,792 --> 00:20:00,667
It's why <i>I've </i>devoted everything
into developing a time machine.

323
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:04,750
You've only managed
to get as far as you have

324
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,333
because of our shared wish to save her.

325
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:13,292
So... trick yourself.

326
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:16,875
Save Kurisu, without
changing the fact that she died.

327
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:21,708
Convince your past self that
she's dead when she's really alive.

328
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:25,542
Do so, and the past won't change.

329
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:27,125
I see...

330
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,000
--What does he mean?
--Do you understand, Okarin?

331
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,208
I'm sure you understand.

332
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:37,083
Incidentally, the time machine is a Type C204.

333
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:41,083
I doubt I need to tell
you what the C stands for.

334
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,750
Christina...

335
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:48,583
I was also the one who named
the target world line "Steins Gate."

336
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:52,417
I'm sure you know the
reason for that name too.

337
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,542
It doesn't really mean anything.

338
00:20:56,542 --> 00:20:58,167
Isn't that right?

339
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:05,583
I will now outline your
final mission: Operation Skuld.

340
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:09,000
You must change the outcome
without altering established past events.

341
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:15,333
Okabe Rintaro observes Makise
Kurisu on the ground, soaked in blood.

342
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:19,583
You must change the outcome
without altering that established event.

343
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,125
Deceive your original self.

344
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,250
Deceive the world.

345
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,917
That is the only way
you can reach Steins Gate.

346
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,958
Good luck.

347
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,625
El Psy Congroo.

348
00:21:38,292 --> 00:21:40,708
What the heck?

349
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,542
Was that you 15 years from now?

350
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:45,875
He sounded so suave!

351
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:56,208
"Operation Skuld"?

352
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,667
"El Psy Congroo"?

353
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:01,917
I still act like that when I'm 33?!

354
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:08,083
It's like I've gone full-on delusional!

355
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,958
Okarin...

356
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,292
I'll do it...

357
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:16,583
If that's the choice of Steins Gate!

358
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:21,500
I am the mad scientist... Hououin Kyouma!

359
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,083
Fooling the world is nothing to me!

360
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,500
Whoa. He's back to his old self again.

361
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,542
Mayushii likes this Okarin better, though!

362
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:39,208
I'll say it again!

363
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:44,667
I am the mad scientist...

364
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:47,125
...Hououin Kyouma!

365
00:22:48,958 --> 00:24:02,070
The world is in the palm of my hand!
