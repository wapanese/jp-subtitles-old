1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,625
I will now outline your
final mission: Operation Skuld.

2
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:15,917
You must change the outcome
without altering established past events.

3
00:00:15,917 --> 00:00:20,958
Okabe Rintaro observes Makise
Kurisu on the ground, soaked in blood.

4
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:25,333
You must change the outcome
without altering that established event.

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,000
Hand me that screwdriver, Dad.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,542
--Why do you keep calling me that?
--Just hurry up.

7
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:40,000
Looks like this is it.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,292
There's only enough fuel left
for one trip to the past and back.

9
00:00:44,292 --> 00:00:48,208
You mean you can't return to your time?

10
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,750
I never intended to.

11
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:55,542
Changing the world line
here will change the future,

12
00:00:55,542 --> 00:00:58,542
so I won't need to go back.

13
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:00,375
It's just...

14
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,625
If we <i>don't </i>change things,
then I'll be stuck here for good...

15
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:10,292
...living a life of regret.

16
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,875
That's nonsense.

17
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,708
Uncle...

18
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,417
Don't call me that.

19
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,667
I am Hououin Kyouma.

20
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:28,208
A mad scientist...

21
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:31,708
...and the destroyer of
this world's ruling structure.

22
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:35,083
Failure is out of the question.

23
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:42,083
Okay. I believe in you.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,500
We will now set Operation Skuld into motion!

25
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,250
The time has come!

26
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:07,833
<i>For you, the assertion of</i>
<i>life and its meaningless proof</i>

27
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:14,500
<i>are so comical they don't</i>
<i>even help pass the boredom</i>

28
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,708
<i>Those of a foolish race,</i>
<i>acting as if they ruled over all,</i>

29
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:25,625
<i>presented a conceited, childish theorem</i>

30
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:31,750
<i>"Infinite" love and the far reaches of the sky</i>

31
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:37,625
<i>are part of a hypothetical</i>
<i>freedom we've been shown</i>

32
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:43,833
<i>"Finite" is the merciless march of time,</i>

33
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:48,417
<i>leading to a choice to deny even tomorrow</i>

34
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:50,667
<i>Hacking to the Gate</i>

35
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:57,583
<i>The countless brilliant days</i>
<i>and promises made to my friends...</i>

36
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:02,500
<i>I must not "undo" any of it</i>

37
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:09,500
<i>So I'll use what tricks I have left to deceive time,</i>

38
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:16,208
<i>as a lone observer who no longer has doubt</i>

39
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,375
Where is it?!

40
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,542
I know I put it around here somewhere...

41
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,458
"The time has come!" you exclaim!

42
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:32,542
But then you shamble back to the
lab because you forgot something...

43
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:34,250
Hurry up.

44
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:39,250
We can't leave the time
machine up there for too long.

45
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,958
I think this is...

46
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,333
The Glow Stick Saber?

47
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,125
What are you gonna do with that?

48
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:54,458
The fake blood planted
in the tip is what I need.

49
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,750
Huh?! I didn't know it had that...

50
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,333
I see. That's going to serve
as Makise Kurisu's "blood," huh?

51
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,958
Indeed.

52
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:08,875
If the July 28th version of me finds
her unconscious in a pool of fake blood,

53
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,333
the established past will remain unchanged.

54
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,250
That's what Operation Skuld is about.

55
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,208
Well, your idea <i>is </i>sound, but...

56
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,208
Doesn't that seem too simplistic?

57
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,250
It felt like the future Okarin

58
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:26,125
was talking about
something way more enigmatic...

59
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:31,208
Hououin Kyouma is the type
to exaggerate about a plan

60
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,375
the more simplistic it is.

61
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:35,500
Fool.

62
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,083
I already see through your ways!

63
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,792
I don't know whether to be impressed or not...

64
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:44,375
Sadface.

65
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,208
Say, Okarin.

66
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:54,417
Did Kurisu-<i>san </i>used to sit here with you?

67
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:55,542
Mayuri...

68
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:59,167
She'd always talk a lot with Daru-<i>kun</i>...

69
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:04,083
I never understood her,
but she would talk so excitedly...

70
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:07,708
She and you would argue all the time,

71
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,750
but I could tell you were good friends...

72
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,125
What are you talking about, Mayushii?

73
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:15,083
Makise Kurisu is a scientific genius.

74
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,375
She'd never come to a lab like this.

75
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,208
You're right. That'd be strange.

76
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:23,167
Maybe I just dreamed it...

77
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:25,917
Could it be she has the Reading Steiner too?

78
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:29,667
No, there's no such ability.

79
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:33,208
But... some part inside remembers

80
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,917
what's happened in other world lines...

81
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:39,208
Everyone remembers, somewhere deep down...

82
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:42,833
Kurisu did everything she could to save Mayuri.

83
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:48,167
It's because of Kurisu that
Mayuri--no, that <i>we're</i>--here now.

84
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:49,792
Huh?

85
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,125
Say, Okarin.

86
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:56,167
Do you like Kurisu-<i>san</i>?

87
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,667
Christina is my assistant...

88
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,583
...a dear friend...

89
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,583
...and someone special to me.

90
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,417
Ah!

91
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:12,250
And she's also in love with me.

92
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,333
No way! This is so real-life...

93
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:20,208
Then you definitely have
to save her. No matter what.

94
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,875
You <i>have </i>to save her!

95
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,125
Yeah...

96
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,917
Promise you'll come
back, okay? With Kurisu-<i>san</i>...

97
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:41,917
But of course.

98
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:43,458
U-Umm...

99
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,917
Miss Amane...

100
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:49,167
If you really are my daughter...

101
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:51,083
...then who's my wife?

102
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,583
I'll leave that a secret.

103
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,417
Again?

104
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,250
Let's go!

105
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,917
I've brought us to the
exact same time as before.

106
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:18,750
The rest is up to you.

107
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,000
I know.

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,500
Leave the Glow Stick Saber at the spot for me.

109
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,042
No problem.

110
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:30,042
Changing the outcome without
altering the established past...

111
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:32,167
The first order of business...

112
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,458
...is this.

113
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,333
I don't know how it connects to all this.

114
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:41,500
But if I get the Metal Oopa now,

115
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,500
it'll reduce the chance of
metal getting into that envelope.

116
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,208
Just as I thought.

117
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:01,458
There aren't many in this series left,

118
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:06,250
but Mayushii's out of 100-yen coins...

119
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,417
Don't act so spoiled, Mayuri.

120
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:11,333
Even if we are childhood friends,
I'm not lending you money.

121
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,708
Aww...

122
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:18,375
Allow me to show you
the harsh realities of life.

123
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:27,500
It's an Oopa!

124
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,917
Is it rare?

125
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:33,583
No, but it's really cute, don't you think?

126
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,833
Okay. Next up...!

127
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,833
Oh, pardon me--

128
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,417
K-Kurisu...

129
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:51,750
Huh? How do you know my name?

130
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,958
Have we met before?

131
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,125
Kurisu...

132
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,625
Are you even listening--

133
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,625
What's your problem?!

134
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,750
Answer my question!

135
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:07,167
I'm...

136
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,625
I'm here... to save you.

137
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:20,417
Dr. Nakabachi's conference is
about to begin in the 8th floor hall.

138
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:23,167
Wait! Stop!

139
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,042
I never thought I'd have
to pretend to be myself...

140
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:52,625
So Kurisu picked up the
Oopa after Mayuri dropped it...!

141
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:56,083
But since this one isn't metal,

142
00:09:56,083 --> 00:10:01,458
Nakabachi's envelope should
burn up in the airplane accident now.

143
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,625
Now I just need to drive Nakabachi away

144
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:16,625
and find a chance to knock Kurisu out...

145
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,542
The fake blood's dried up?!

146
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,917
I see...

147
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:38,833
It was left unused for so long
that the air exposure solidified it...

148
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,542
--What do <i>you </i>want?
--Umm, I'd like you to read...

149
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:44,250
--Think... Think!
--Umm, I'd like you to read...

150
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,208
There's gotta be something!

151
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,875
Something...!

152
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:51,042
Think.

153
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:54,958
Getting rid of Nakabachi
should be easy enough.

154
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,333
The problem is the blood.

155
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,583
I just need something
else that looks like blood!

156
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,167
Be quiet!

157
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,958
How dare you call me a thief...!

158
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,667
That's it!

159
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,375
Stop it!

160
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,083
Who the hell are you?!

161
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:19,708
I am the seeker of chaos, the destroyer
of this world's ruling structure...

162
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,458
...and...

163
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,125
...the shatterer of your ambitions!

164
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:28,500
Do you wish to hear it?

165
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,292
My name is...

166
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:33,375
...Hououin...

167
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:35,750
...Kyouma!

168
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:39,917
What nonsense is this?

169
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:42,917
You're that kid...!

170
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:47,458
I see. So <i>that's </i>how it is...

171
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:53,417
The two of you conspired
to ruin my press conference.

172
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:58,583
Now I see. So <i>that's </i>how it is...

173
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,000
Daddy...!

174
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,542
--Run!
--I refuse!

175
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:11,625
What's wrong? What's the knife for?

176
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,750
Wh-What?!

177
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,042
Just acting tough?

178
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:20,667
Afraid of my god-like power, are you?

179
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,917
L-Like hell I am!

180
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:25,000
What's the matter?!

181
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,333
You're shaking. Are you scared?

182
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,625
How long are you going to mock me?!

183
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:34,625
In the end, you're just a pathetic little man.

184
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,917
If you can't even appreciate
your own daughter's abilities...

185
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:41,417
...then you could never kill me!

186
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:43,042
Never...!

187
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:44,792
Never!

188
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,875
N-No...

189
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:11,542
N-No... This can't be...

190
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,208
Th-That'll teach you...!

191
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:20,667
--Stay calm... Just a little more...
--Th-That's what you get for mocking me...

192
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:39,625
H-How dare you...

193
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,875
I'll kill...

194
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,458
I'll kill you...!

195
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,042
I'll get you for this!

196
00:14:07,042 --> 00:14:09,750
D-Don't move!

197
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,625
L-Lie down! I'll call an ambulance!

198
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:18,375
Hello?! Emergency services?!

199
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,958
Come right away!

200
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,125
--Someone's been stabbed!
--I...

201
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:27,125
...told you...

202
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,250
...I would...

203
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,042
...save you...!

204
00:15:24,292 --> 00:15:26,042
This is...

205
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:29,833
...without a doubt...

206
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,583
...the Kurisu I saw.

207
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:42,292
Uncle...

208
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,083
Goodbye...

209
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,167
--Wait...
--Huh?

210
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:03,125
Just hold on a minute...

211
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,750
This is no time for that!

212
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,708
If we don't hurry, you'll...!

213
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,333
Please...

214
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,875
Hey.

215
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,042
Is someone there...?

216
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:22,875
Good luck.

217
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,000
You're about to begin...

218
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,375
...the longest and most important...

219
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,750
...three weeks of your life.

220
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:46,708
That was <i>too </i>reckless!
Just how stupid are you?!

221
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,833
What do you mean, stupid?
The plan worked, didn't it...?

222
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,000
I've only superficially stopped the bleeding.

223
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,125
Go straight to the hospital when you get back.

224
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,875
It'll be tough, but stay strong.

225
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,333
Here we go!

226
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,083
Is this...?

227
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:18,333
Steins Gate is a world line unknown to all.

228
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,750
Suzuha...

229
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:25,708
But if your theory is correct,
that paper will burn up,

230
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,292
the time machine development
race will never happen,

231
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:32,542
and World War III will never take place.

232
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:35,708
I can't stay with you.

233
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:39,125
So I'll thank you while I can.

234
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,333
Thanks.

235
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:48,542
See you again, in seven years...

236
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Okarin!

237
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,458
Huh?

238
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:19,083
That paper on time machines
was the key to mankind's future!

239
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,792
But it burned up!

240
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:22,292
His comments are incoherent,

241
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:25,750
and the Russian government
is poised to deny his defection--

242
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,917
Ruka-<i>kun</i>! Okarin was here?!

243
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:31,167
I must've just missed him...

244
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:32,792
Oh, when he was here...

245
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:38,000
It identifies you as Lab Member 006.

246
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,917
Huh? When did I become a lab member?

247
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:46,583
Perhaps those memories
reside in a previous life.

248
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,958
Oh?

249
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,375
I wonder what these letters are...

250
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,792
Kyouma?

251
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:54,875
He was just here, meow!

252
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,583
He was?

253
00:18:56,583 --> 00:19:00,000
Did he give you anything, Faris-<i>chan</i>?

254
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,125
Actually...

255
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:06,042
It's a badge for Lab Member 007.

256
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:09,333
If you ever need help, hold it tight

257
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,708
and chant, "La Yoda Stasella!"

258
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,375
Oh...

259
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:19,708
Huh? If you're lookin'
for Okabe, he was just here.

260
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:20,833
Big Sis Mayuri!

261
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,625
Too-too-roo, Nae-<i>chan</i>!

262
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,083
--And...?
--Ah!

263
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:27,167
This is our new part-timer as of today!

264
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,167
I'm Kiryu Moeka...

265
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,875
She helped Nae after she took a spill.

266
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:36,792
She said she didn't have a job,
so I brought her on board.

267
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:38,875
I'm Shiina Mayuri!

268
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,833
She sure is popular.

269
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:47,042
Ol' Okabe started hitting
on her as soon as they met...

270
00:19:47,042 --> 00:19:50,917
Visit our lab anytime you want.

271
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,083
Umm...

272
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,875
Thank you...

273
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,208
Too-too-roo!

274
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,125
Welcome back-arin!

275
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,333
Did you combine "Welcome back" and "Okarin"?

276
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,125
Yeah!

277
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,208
Where's Okarin?

278
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,917
Oh, he went to buy some things.

279
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:14,500
Oh...

280
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,458
Oh!

281
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,958
These? He says they're lab member badges.

282
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:23,875
Lab Member 002 and 003!

283
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,708
When did we gain so many members, though?

284
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:30,042
He said they go all the way up to 008...

285
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:31,625
There's "O" for Okarin...

286
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:35,583
Shiina, Hashida, Urushibara, Faris...

287
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,917
Huh? What do M, K, and A stand for?

288
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:40,333
Beats me.

289
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:44,792
He also put one in a box.

290
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:49,250
Lab Member 008 will
appear seven years from now.

291
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,083
More of your delusions?

292
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,583
It's an inevitability. For you.

293
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,208
Me...?

294
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,667
Seven years from now...

295
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:02,417
I can't wait! I wonder
what that person will be like!

296
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:06,542
I can't even imagine that far ahead...

297
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:11,250
I don't think the lab will ever change, though.

298
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,833
No matter how much time passes...

299
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,750
Where are you now?

300
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,875
Are you working on a paper at
an American research institute?

301
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:28,917
Are you pulling an all-nighter on
an experiment to test an idea of yours?

302
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:33,542
Maybe you're still troubled by
what happened with your father.

303
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:39,125
You have no memory of the
three weeks you spent with me.

304
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,708
But that's okay.

305
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,292
Somewhere out there

306
00:21:42,292 --> 00:21:47,583
you're breathing, speaking,
thinking hard about something...

307
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,292
That's all that matters.

308
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:54,708
Because somewhere out there
you're looking at the same world I am...

309
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,792
...this world with an unknown future.

310
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:16,208
I... finally found you...

311
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,292
I've been looking everywhere for you.

312
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:25,250
I wanted to thank you for saving me...

313
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,875
It's me.

314
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,625
What is she doing here?

315
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:42,875
What? You want <i>me </i>to protect her?

316
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:46,792
Sheesh. Talk about an indulgent order.

317
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:48,792
But no matter.

318
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:51,583
If that's its choice...

319
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:54,000
El Psy Congroo.

320
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,917
"Elp Sy"...?

321
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,125
We meet again, Christina!

322
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:03,542
I told you, I'm not
"Christina" <i>or </i>your assistant!

323
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:05,167
Huh?

324
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:12,417
Welcome, assistant of mine...

325
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:13,542
...Makise Kurisu.

326
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:16,583
No, Christina.

327
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:24,333
No one knows what the future holds.

328
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:30,583
That's precisely why, just as
this reunion demonstrates...

329
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,833
...the possibilities are infinite.

330
00:23:35,333 --> 00:24:02,070
<i>This </i>is the choice of Steins Gate.
