1
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:13,458
I need you to distract
Mr. Braun for just five seconds

2
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:16,917
so he won't notice the
shockwaves from the experiment.

3
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:20,583
No prob! This calls for some womanly charm!

4
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:23,250
Feel for yourself!
I have rock-hard muscles!

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,042
--Oh, you do.
--Right?! So just leave it to me!

6
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:28,792
--You <i>are </i>turning on the charm, right...?
--Yeah! Why?

7
00:00:28,792 --> 00:00:30,125
Never mind. Do your thing.

8
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,375
Okey-dokey!

9
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,417
Now!

10
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,625
Assistant! Commence!

11
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,500
What the...?!

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,167
O-Okab--!

13
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:51,292
Ack... I failed...

14
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:54,542
How many damn times do I hafta--?!

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,083
It stopped?

16
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,708
Was it my assistant? No, wait...

17
00:01:14,917 --> 00:01:19,208
Could it be...?!

18
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,958
Could it be...

19
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,667
...<i>what</i>?!

20
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:46,750
<i>For you, billions and billions of heartbeats</i>

21
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:53,458
<i>are nothing at all; just the blink of an eye</i>

22
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:58,667
<i>Although I'm trapped by</i>
<i>the past and lament the future</i>

23
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:04,583
<i>inevitability won't allow for</i>
<i>even a speck of a miscalculation</i>

24
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:10,708
<i>Our dreams and futures that</i>
<i>form and expand into "infinity"</i>

25
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:16,542
<i>allow us the right to be vain,</i>

26
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:22,750
<i>while the two hands</i>
<i>point out what is "finite"</i>

27
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,333
<i>All of which leads to a cruel</i>
<i>contract and choice to make</i>

28
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,583
<i>Hacking to the Gate</i>

29
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:36,542
<i>So, now, with each passing</i>
<i>second, I'll cross world lines</i>

30
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:41,458
<i>to protect that smile on your face</i>

31
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:48,458
<i>Then, once again, into a</i>
<i>time loop without sadness</i>

32
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:55,125
<i>I will be swallowed up as a lone observer</i>

33
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:07,417
In other words, the 42-inch
CRT television downstairs

34
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:10,458
just happened to act
as a replacement lifter?

35
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:14,125
And we were only able to send D-mails

36
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:17,417
while it was on during business hours?

37
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:19,000
That <i>would </i>explain it!

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,750
Not so loud... My head's killing me...

39
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,875
Are you okay?

40
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:28,333
Damn Mr. Braun,
resorting to violence like that...

41
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,958
You reap what you sow, I guess.

42
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:34,458
<i>You're </i>the one who wanted
to run the experiment...

43
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:39,917
At any rate, now we know how the
Phone Microwave works for the most part.

44
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:41,375
Which means now...

45
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:44,875
...We should consider how to
make physical time travel possible.

46
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,500
--Can't.
--Don't split-second reject it!

47
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,500
You'll wind up in gel
form no matter what we try.

48
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,125
Compressing an entire
human into 36 bytes is just too--

49
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:58,875
Showing off at a time like this?

50
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,042
Why would I care
about showing off to you?

51
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:03,083
Look at the title of my paper.

52
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:06,667
"An Analysis of Neural Pulse Signals

53
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:09,875
in Relation to Memories
Stored in the Temporal Lobe."

54
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,833
In Japanese, please?

55
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:15,792
Basically, it's about human memory.

56
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:18,667
I specialize in brain science.

57
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:24,417
In simple terms, memories are
stored in the brain via pulse signals.

58
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:26,542
It's a type of electrical data.

59
00:04:26,542 --> 00:04:28,458
Data...

60
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,250
--Are you saying...?!
--Yes.

61
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,542
Physically sending someone is
pretty much out of the question,

62
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:37,125
but it <i>might </i>be possible
to send their memory data.

63
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,333
To where?

64
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,208
To their past self.

65
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:44,167
You'd convert your memories into
data and send it just like a D-mail.

66
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:49,417
Basically, you take what's in your head
now and implant it into your past self.

67
00:04:49,417 --> 00:04:52,208
In other words, you go
back to your earlier you?!

68
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:56,208
It's not so much "time travel"
as it is a "time leap."

69
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,667
It's me.

70
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:00,417
It's all come together.

71
00:05:00,417 --> 00:05:04,708
The plan has entered its final phase.

72
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:09,292
Commence Operation Verdandi--the
goddess who rules the present!

73
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:10,583
--No idea what that means.
--Oh...!

74
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,708
Care to explain what that is?!

75
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,708
I'm talking about using
this "time leap" of yours!

76
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:17,667
Begin at once.

77
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:22,083
It's not that easy. I need
all kinds of materials first.

78
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:25,083
But we should be able to find them in Akiba,

79
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:31,542
since we only need to <i>read </i>the
memory signals in the temporal lobe.

80
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:33,333
It's just...

81
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,250
What's wrong?

82
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,292
The Phone Microwave
probably isn't powerful enough

83
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:42,708
to compress all that memory data.

84
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,333
And...

85
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:46,708
And what?

86
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,750
Nothing.

87
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,000
All right. Here are all the parts I'll need.

88
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,250
Mayushii doesn't understand any of this.

89
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,542
Christina already explained it.

90
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:04,583
We can send your mind,
as it exists now, back in time.

91
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:09,375
Sounds kinda scary.

92
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:12,167
Can't we just stick to D-mails?

93
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:15,958
D-mails introduce too many uncertainties.

94
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:20,875
A single message can have
completely unexpected results.

95
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,583
But sending memories back is okay?

96
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:29,167
At the very least, it'd give us <i>some</i>
control over the changes that are made,

97
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:32,500
such as all of Akiba transforming.

98
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,333
Transforming?

99
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,417
Oh, nothing.

100
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:43,625
Oh, but what happens to <i>this </i>you
after you send your memory back in time?

101
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,875
Your body doesn't get sent, right?

102
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,292
Hmm, well...

103
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:53,375
Plus, you know how
we're talking right now?

104
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,375
Yeah.

105
00:06:54,375 --> 00:07:00,458
So let's say Mayushii goes back
a week and redoes the last week.

106
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:04,917
What would happen if she
avoids talking to you this time?

107
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:09,917
Well, my guess is that
you'll retain your memory

108
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:12,333
but the fact that we talked will disappear.

109
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:20,000
In other words, Mayushii will
remember us talking, but you won't at all?

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,625
Right.

111
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:25,750
Then I'd feel kind of sad.

112
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,708
For me?

113
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,958
For Mayushii.

114
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,750
Oh, there's Moeka-<i>san</i>!

115
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,292
Moeka-<i>san</i>!

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,583
Too-too-roo!

117
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:56,625
You look rather glum, Shining Finger.

118
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,750
"Did you scrap the time machine?"

119
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,250
No, we're still using it!

120
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,583
And now we might be
able to "time leap" with it!

121
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,667
--Don't just blurt our secrets out!
--Huh?

122
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:15,708
But Moeka-<i>san</i>'s a lab member too!

123
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,708
Yeah, but still...

124
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:22,167
"What's a time leap?"

125
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:26,583
It's exactly as it sounds:
Making memories "leap" back in time!

126
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,417
Memories...?

127
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,125
Moeka-<i>san</i>?

128
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,042
Oh! Moeka-<i>san</i>!

129
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:41,750
Is she okay?

130
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,500
Guess I'll hit Akibaoo first.
More efficient that way...

131
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,667
Big Sis Mayuri!

132
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,625
Now it's you, Nae-<i>chan</i>!

133
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,542
--What are you doing here?
--'Sup!

134
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:00,542
Y-You're still dressed like that?!

135
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:05,542
Yeah, my boss yelled at me and
told me to stay like this all day...

136
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:07,250
That's poison for children's eyes.

137
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,500
Poison?

138
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,083
I usually try not to carry poison with me.

139
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:11,917
Huh?

140
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:15,500
Anyway, Nae was looking
all over for you, Okabe Rintaro.

141
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,000
She said she has something to tell you.

142
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,208
To tell <i>me</i>?

143
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,792
Yeah.

144
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:25,167
I'm sorry my dad was
so mean to you earlier!

145
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:26,292
Nae-<i>chan</i>...

146
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:28,458
You came all this way for that...?

147
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,083
What a well-bred critter you are.

148
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,000
She's <i>not </i>a critter.

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,167
Don't worry.

150
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm always causing
Mr. Braun trouble. Now we're even.

151
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,583
That isn't like you, Okabe Rintaro.

152
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,208
Oh? Okarin is always like this!

153
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:51,917
Well, Mayushii should get going now!

154
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:55,083
--Meeting someone?
--Yeah! Fubuki-<i>chan</i>, a cosplayer!

155
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:58,875
--I'm giving her a costume!
--Oh, right, Comima is coming up.

156
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,417
Yep. Bye, now!

157
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:03,542
And for Suzu-<i>san </i>and Nae-<i>chan</i>: Too-too-roo!

158
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:05,750
See you later!

159
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,750
Well, should we head back too?

160
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,417
No, I still have to find some
parts Christina asked for...

161
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:18,458
Makise Kurisu... works for SERN.

162
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:32,042
A SERN spy?

163
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:33,875
That can't be true...

164
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:41,708
--Never gonna...
--...give you up.

165
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,542
Don't sneak up on me! That's not fair!

166
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:50,167
So you <i>were </i>posting on @channel...

167
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:51,833
--H-Hold on--
--I've known you were a...

168
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,417
--It isn't like that...
--...cheeky @channeler for some time now.

169
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:55,250
Am not!

170
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,917
There's no point trying to hide it now!

171
00:10:57,917 --> 00:11:00,125
FML...

172
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:04,208
But no matter. I hereby officially
grant you the title of "Channeler"--

173
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,500
Don't give me any more weird names!

174
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,708
At least just don't tell anyone else!

175
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,292
Why not?

176
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:12,917
You should list it on your resume.

177
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:14,542
"Hobbies: @channel"!

178
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:17,917
If @channel knew a scholar was posting,
they'd make a thread or two about you!

179
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:19,208
I don't care.

180
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:23,833
Then maybe you can
do an AMA on /b/ instead?

181
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,292
I hate that I know what that means!

182
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:29,125
But now I'm relieved.

183
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:34,375
Someone who's so bad at hiding
her secret life can't possibly be a spy.

184
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,292
Huh? What are you talking about?

185
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:40,917
Oh, the part-time warrior
claims you're a SERN spy.

186
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:45,333
You know I'm not. That's ridiculous.

187
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,458
Of course.

188
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:52,250
You're an agent sent by the
Organization who's had a change of heart

189
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,333
and works as my assistant now.

190
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:58,417
--That's wrong, too.
--So, how is the work coming along?

191
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,583
Work?

192
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,750
The time leap! I bought
all the parts you need!

193
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,792
Oh, right. I guess I need to put it together...

194
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:09,667
We've come this far and all...

195
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:13,292
What's the problem? Getting cold feet?

196
00:12:13,292 --> 00:12:15,083
Yes, partly.

197
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:19,167
I'm worried what'll happen
if we really go through with this.

198
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:21,958
But, more than that...

199
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,042
What?

200
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,000
I guess I should tell you.

201
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,542
You've figured out
enough about me as it is...

202
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,292
But not here.

203
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:35,917
Let's go somewhere
where I can't see your face.

204
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:44,417
My father and I have some
issues between us, you see...

205
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:47,333
Then it's true your father fell to the dark side

206
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,375
after you were struck by lightning in Arkansas--

207
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,375
If you're going to joke
around, then never mind.

208
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,333
All right. Tell me more.

209
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,958
Basically, my father doesn't like me.

210
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,750
No, he detests me.

211
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:06,167
And not as his daughter,
but as a scientist... As a rival.

212
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:09,292
He was a physicist.

213
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:15,417
When I was little, I loved hearing
him talk about complicated physics.

214
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:17,833
As a result, I was able
to understand his papers

215
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:22,333
before I was in middle school.

216
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:27,208
And then I started writing papers
and winning awards of my own.

217
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,708
But I didn't care about the awards.

218
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:34,833
I just enjoyed debating with my father.

219
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:39,667
We would share papers through
e-mail and debate more and more...

220
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:46,458
But, at some point, he stopped talking to me.

221
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:52,500
During our debates,
I kept disproving his theories.

222
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:59,417
By pointing out all his mistakes,
I unknowingly damaged his pride...

223
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,708
He started taking it out on my mother.

224
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:09,500
His confidence was shot, and he
found himself abandoned by academia.

225
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,167
The last time I saw him, he told me this...

226
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:19,208
"Do you pity me? Do you look down on me?

227
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,792
How dare you. You're my damn daughter."

228
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:33,083
If I <i>do </i>create a time leap device,

229
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:37,500
I'm absolutely certain it'll make my
father more furious than ever before.

230
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,375
That's why you're hesitant to build it?

231
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:43,125
Don't worry, though.
I'm obviously going to build it.

232
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,083
Because you're right...

233
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,583
I love to experiment.

234
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:51,750
I always need to be
testing or confirming something.

235
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,042
Just like my father did.

236
00:14:55,042 --> 00:15:00,125
Just like during the time he and I shared...

237
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:16,250
In that case, let us begin
Operation Verdandi at once!

238
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,958
We've no time to waste!

239
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,000
The Organization is at our heels!

240
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,625
You sum it up with <i>that</i>?

241
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,792
But of course! I am Hououin Kyouma!

242
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:29,667
It is my mission to reform
the ruling structure of this world!

243
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,375
This was a mistake.

244
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,875
<i>And </i>we'll reconcile things!

245
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,583
--Where is your father now?
--Huh? Oh, in Aomori.

246
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,250
Then we will require funds for traveling.

247
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,458
When you've decided a time
to go, let me know right away.

248
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,417
D-Don't tell me you're planning on coming too?!

249
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:47,583
Of course I am!

250
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:53,417
I need you working at peak mental
efficiency if I'm to achieve my ambition!

251
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:56,042
Hououin Kyouma shall accompany you,

252
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:59,292
bring the topic up in a
wonderfully compassionate manner,

253
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,500
and clear the air
between father and daughter.

254
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,875
Get serious. You're a
self-proclaimed mad scientist.

255
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,958
You're not supposed to be compassionate.

256
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,167
Well, I, err...

257
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,083
Why are you laughing?!

258
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:19,583
The trouble with you is that
sometimes you <i>can </i>be a nice guy.

259
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,875
If you recognize my greatness,
then get back to work.

260
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,083
Yeah, yeah.

261
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,250
Just so you know,
since it's set in stone now,

262
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,542
I <i>will </i>drag you along if I have to.

263
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,292
Sounds good to me.

264
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:37,875
Too-too-roo...

265
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,708
Oh! Mayuri-<i>chan</i>?

266
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,208
What's with all the heavy bags?

267
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,875
Shouldn't you ask that
Okarin or whoever for help?

268
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,333
I'll be okay...

269
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,792
I'm almost there...!

270
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:57,292
Look right here! It clearly
has "Makise" written on it!

271
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:59,958
It could mean "Makise Pudding"!

272
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:03,083
You know, like "Morinaga
Pudding" or "Koiwai Pudding."

273
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,375
Don't give me that!

274
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:07,583
--Who <i>is </i>"Makise" anyway?
--It's my name!

275
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,292
Christina Makise, huh?

276
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:12,250
If you had just written "Christina" then,

277
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,250
I could've avoided ingesting
unnecessary caloric content.

278
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,167
You have some nerve,
eating other people's stuff!

279
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:20,375
In fact, that's <i>my </i>spoon!
I didn't say you could use it!

280
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:24,292
Well, <i>you </i>use the lab's forks
without permission, you know!

281
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:26,250
I made it...

282
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,208
Oh, what's in the bags?

283
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:33,625
Costume materials and
Mayushii's sleepover kit!

284
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,125
Sleepover?

285
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:38,917
Yeah! I'm making costumes for Comima!

286
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:42,042
Is it really okay? Did you ask your parents?

287
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:43,833
I just told them!

288
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:47,208
You're spending the night too to
upgrade the Phone Microwave, right?

289
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,042
Huh? Oh, right.

290
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:53,875
I was considering it, but I think
I'd be miserable staying the night here.

291
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:58,333
Some Hououin guy keeps
eating other people's pudding.

292
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:01,292
It's "Hououin Kyouma"!
You can at least remember my name!

293
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:04,792
Like you're anyone to talk!
And don't brush the pudding issue aside!

294
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,875
Maybe I should go home after all...

295
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:07,750
Huh?

296
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:12,625
Oh, I don't mind staying,
as long as Okabe leaves.

297
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,375
S-Say what?!

298
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,958
My lab is where my soul dwells!

299
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,833
I shall not leave!

300
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:24,250
They're the ones sleeping over;
why do I have to go shopping?

301
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:29,333
I feel like I've been my assistant's
errand boy ever since yesterday...

302
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,625
Huh?

303
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,583
Christina, huh...

304
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:42,708
"Don't get cocky. Don't forget
your duty as a lab member."

305
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,875
I'm <i>not </i>acting cocky, you idiot.

306
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,125
Oh?! What now?!

307
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh, it's nothing!

308
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,083
Hurry and get in, before Okabe comes back!

309
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,708
Right!

310
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,208
My assistant again?

311
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:14,208
What the...?!

312
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,375
Mayuri...

313
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,500
Mayuri! Mayuri!

314
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,417
U-U...

315
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:31,750
Unforgivable!

316
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,708
I'll <i>never </i>forgive you for this!

317
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:38,625
Okarin. Mayushii is very sad and embarrassed.

318
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:43,417
Geez! You peeped on us
<i>and </i>forgot to buy anything?!

319
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:45,500
You're unbelievable!

320
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:50,000
--Hey, Okabe...
--Okarin?

321
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,333
Daru-<i>kun</i>!

322
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,042
What are you doing here so late?

323
00:20:56,042 --> 00:20:58,083
Well...

324
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,833
I thought so.

325
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:04,042
Something seemed weird when
I tried to remotely log in to this PC...

326
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:05,083
Did something happen?

327
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:09,208
It looks like this is directly
connected to the heart of SERN.

328
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,417
SERN?!

329
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:12,333
You've taken control of their system?!

330
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,042
It was a piece o' cake.

331
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:19,000
...Or so I'd like to say, but I really
have no idea how it happened.

332
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,708
It's almost like SERN was on
pins and needles just waiting for this.

333
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,708
--They were excited?
--Hold on!

334
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,208
If we didn't connect to them,

335
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:34,375
does that mean SERN took
notice and is trying to access <i>us</i>?!

336
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:38,208
But I'm certain I didn't screw
anything up that'd get us caught...

337
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:41,292
--Now we can use the LHC all we want!
--Could it be...?!

338
00:21:41,292 --> 00:21:43,750
--SERN?!
--Really? The LHC?

339
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,625
Okarin?

340
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,708
Did something happen on your phone?

341
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:00,458
No...

342
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,000
It's nothing.

343
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:35,167
<i>With my vision restricted, there's no escape</i>

344
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:43,917
<i>from the merciless control of the twelve</i>

<i>I embark for the horizon of the</i>

<i>Trapped by the covenant and</i>
<i>shown the outline of false evidence</i>

<i>Flutter, butterfly, oh, miraculous</i>
<i>butterfly! I give myself to you</i>

350
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:35,292
