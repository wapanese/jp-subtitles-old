1
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:57,917
<i>For you, billions and billions of heartbeats</i>

2
00:00:57,917 --> 00:01:04,583
<i>are nothing at all; just the blink of an eye</i>

3
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:09,792
<i>Although I'm trapped by</i>
<i>the past and lament the future</i>

4
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:15,750
<i>inevitability won't allow for</i>
<i>even a speck of a miscalculation</i>

5
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,875
<i>Our dreams and futures that</i>
<i>form and expand into "infinity"</i>

6
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:27,708
<i>allow us the right to be vain,</i>

7
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:33,917
<i>while the two hands</i>
<i>point out what is "finite"</i>

8
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:38,500
<i>All of which leads to a cruel</i>
<i>contract and choice to make</i>

9
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,750
<i>Hacking to the Gate</i>

10
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:47,667
<i>So, now, with each passing</i>
<i>second, I'll cross world lines</i>

11
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:52,625
<i>to protect that smile on your face</i>

12
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:59,625
<i>Then, once again, into a</i>
<i>time loop without sadness</i>

13
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:06,292
<i>I will be swallowed up as a lone observer</i>

14
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:27,917
I'm starving...

15
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:36,542
--Are you going to Comima--
--You're going again tomorrow, aren't you?

16
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:37,542
Huh?

17
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:38,542
Yeah...

18
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:41,792
--Will you be back around this time?
--I think so.

19
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,750
Say! You should come with me, Kurisu-<i>chan</i>!

20
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,208
Crowded places aren't really my thing...

21
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,708
It shouldn't be too crowded on the second day!

22
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,208
You should come too, Okarin--

23
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,625
Come with me, Okabe!

24
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:08,208
What's with you?! You've been
moody ever since you got back!

25
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:11,958
Can't you tell Mayuri's trying to cheer you up?!

26
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,542
I know she is.

27
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:16,417
But I can't just stay calm!

28
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:17,542
Huh?

29
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:20,000
It happens tomorrow!

30
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:23,917
Even if she's fine today, tomorrow she'll be...!

31
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,792
How many times have
I explained this to you now?

32
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,958
Okabe?

33
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:39,250
There's something I have to tell you.

34
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,833
Mayuri does?! Tomorrow?!

35
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,042
She'll most likely end up dead.

36
00:03:54,042 --> 00:03:56,875
At first, it'd happen on
the night of Friday the 13th.

37
00:03:56,875 --> 00:04:02,667
But each D-mail I undid
pushed it back one day.

38
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,750
Tomorrow, I'll go with her to Comima.

39
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,917
Is there a way to save her?!

40
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:16,125
--I'm going to watch her die.
--What?!

41
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:20,375
I need to determine her
precise deadline on this world line.

42
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:24,958
And then I'll time leap again.

43
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,000
There's no other way.

44
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:35,875
So the next D-mail to undo is the
one by this "Kiryu Moeka" person?

45
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,708
Yeah. I even know what it said.

46
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:43,250
She kept her past self
from switching cell phones.

47
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,250
We'll need to send a message
from her phone this time.

48
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,708
You go look for her!

49
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,417
I'll go with Mayuri to Comima!

50
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:55,375
Are you...?!

51
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,458
If we're lucky, maybe Mayuri won't--

52
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,667
Maybe I can keep it from happening!

53
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,042
Do you know what you're saying?!

54
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:04,417
If I <i>don't </i>find Moeka, then it'll mean--!

55
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:06,625
I'll contact you immediately!

56
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:12,000
Also, you can talk to me
about anything, you know.

57
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
If you need help, for
anything at all, I'm there for you.

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,125
Yeah... You always have been.

59
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:24,000
Never forget.

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,583
Whatever world line
you're on, you <i>aren't </i>alone.

61
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,125
I'm there for you!

62
00:05:38,292 --> 00:05:39,958
"At Ariake now.

63
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,833
Huge crowd here, worse than I imagined.

64
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,667
Save me..."

65
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:51,042
"No reply from Moeka,
but I found where she works.

66
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:54,625
I'll check with them."

67
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,000
"Roger. Don't do anything crazy."

68
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,500
Kiryu Moeka?

69
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,958
Ah, I think I remember her.
She worked for a couple days and then quit.

70
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,208
Her address?

71
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:11,083
I have it... but who exactly are you?

72
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,000
Understood.

73
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,458
Excuse me...!

74
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:34,833
Kiryu Moeka... committed suicide?

75
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,917
--You're certain of it?
--Yeah.

76
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:39,125
--When did it happen?!
--Last night.

77
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:42,083
They took her body to Third Chiyoda Hospital.

78
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,417
We were at a real loss, though.

79
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:46,292
--This can't be...
--Couldn't find <i>any </i>relatives to contact.

80
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,333
Hey, are you okay?

81
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,833
Suicide?

82
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,500
Why?

83
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,917
Did one of her partners kill her?

84
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:04,750
Before killing Mayuri?

85
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,167
But...

86
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:09,042
It doesn't matter why!

87
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:12,250
Mayuri's still gonna be...!

88
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,542
A time leap!

89
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:18,167
If I time leap to before Moeka dies...!

90
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:40,083
--Hello?
--O-Okabe...!

91
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,375
Sh-She's dead... Mayuri's...

92
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,833
Mayuri's...

93
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:48,292
--The deadline is 7:52 pm...
--Mayuri!

94
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:50,292
I'm sorry.

95
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,250
Huh?!

96
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,750
Okabe! Did you eat this?!

97
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,125
Look right here! It clearly
has "Makise" written on it!

98
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,500
Hey! Are you listening to me?!

99
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,000
Never forget. You aren't alone.

100
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:12,292
Yes. You're right, Kurisu.

101
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:15,708
Huh?! Wh-What did you just say?

102
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,042
Do you know a girl named Kiryu Moeka?

103
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:20,250
Huh? Who?

104
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,917
I just did a time leap.

105
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,417
What do you mean?

106
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,625
FB...

107
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:11,042
FB... FB...

108
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:12,708
Answer me...

109
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,458
Please...

110
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,000
FB...

111
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,292
Why won't you message me?

112
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:23,917
Please... Reply to me...!

113
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:26,042
FB...

114
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,250
Kiryu Moeka...

115
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,333
--I did everything you asked me to do...
--It's me, Okabe!

116
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,042
Give me orders, FB!

117
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,500
Can't you hear me?! Hey!

118
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:41,583
FB... FB...

119
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,458
FB...

120
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,708
FB... FB...

121
00:09:50,292 --> 00:09:52,625
N-No! No!

122
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,708
No! No...!

123
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,708
I'll never forgive her!

124
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:16,333
Never...!

125
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:26,125
Give it back...

126
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,792
Give it back! Give it back!

127
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:35,000
Give it back!

128
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,667
--It's me! You have her phone?!
--Just stole it! Get the D-mail set to go!

129
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:39,958
It's ready!

130
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,458
--What's that sound?
--Never mind that! Where's Mayuri?!

131
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,708
The CRT Workshop. The 42-inch TV's on!

132
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,167
All right!

133
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,792
Kurisu!

134
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:51,875
Activate it!

135
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,792
Right!

136
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,667
Give it back! Give it back!

137
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:58,583
This is the last one.

138
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,250
Once I send this...

139
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,667
...Mayuri will be...!

140
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,875
Give it back! Give it back!

141
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,667
Give back my phone!

142
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:26,208
--Huh? Nothing's happened!
--Give it back!

143
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,750
--What's going on?!
--Did you send it?!

144
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,125
Yes! Did you activate it right?!

145
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,458
The discharge took place! What's happened?!

146
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,458
My Reading Steiner hasn't kicked in!

147
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,042
Huh?!

148
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:39,042
My Reading Steiner hasn't activated...

149
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:41,042
How can this be?

150
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:49,125
--Give it back! Give it back!
--Geez, what are you doing in there?

151
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,250
Give it back! Give it back! Give it back!

152
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,708
It's not working!

153
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:59,708
A D-mail's effects greatly depend
on the person who receives it!

154
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:03,667
Could it be that your message
wasn't enough to change her actions?!

155
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:06,000
What do we do, then?!

156
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,125
It didn't change!

157
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,792
She didn't change her cell phone!

158
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:20,875
What do you mean?! Are you sure?!

159
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:24,292
"I got a new phone four days ago,

160
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:27,875
but I wanna tell myself not to buy it."

161
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,708
She must've sent a different
message at the last second!

162
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,917
What! So we <i>don't</i>
know what her D-mail said?!

163
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:36,333
There should be a record of it in here!

164
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,250
I'll check--

165
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:44,208
Give it back! Give it back!

166
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:47,542
--What's going on?! Okabe! Okabe!
--Give it back!

167
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:49,708
I'll call you back!

168
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,833
Give it back! Give it back!

169
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,625
Give it back!

170
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:58,750
Give it back! Give it back!

171
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:07,042
Come <i>on</i>! What are you doing in there?!

172
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,500
Give it back...

173
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,167
Okabe!

174
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,625
Give it back! Give it back!

175
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:38,000
Sheesh! <i>What </i>is going on in there?

176
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,208
Hey, you...

177
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,042
Sheesh, couples these days can be so scary...

178
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,958
What can I do...

179
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:21,500
What can I do... to make you give it back?

180
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,958
Do you remember sending a D-mail?

181
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,042
A D-what...?

182
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:31,750
You should've received a
strange e-mail two weeks ago.

183
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,500
From your future self.

184
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,125
How do you...?

185
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:40,042
Tell me what it said!
And then you can have it back!

186
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:42,750
What's the matter?! Can't tell me?!

187
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:48,500
Was it about the IBN 5100... or the Rounders?!

188
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,583
Oh, am I right?!

189
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:52,333
Tell me! What did the message say?!

190
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,833
Don't you want your phone back?!

191
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,167
--I can't betray--
--Betray who?!

192
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,958
This "FB" of yours?

193
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,500
My orders come from FB.

194
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,208
FB is everything to me...

195
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,250
So this person's calling the shots?!

196
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:20,625
You can't betray FB? How nice and loyal of you.

197
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:26,125
But this FB of yours doesn't
seem to give a damn about <i>you</i>!

198
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,917
FB has abandoned you for good!

199
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:32,292
That's not true...!

200
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:35,833
You've lost all contact, right?!
You've been betrayed!

201
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,167
--You've been tossed aside!
--You're wrong!

202
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:41,000
FB isn't like that!

203
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:52,625
FB saved me...

204
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:57,042
No, you were used!

205
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:21,875
Do you know how I know that?!

206
00:16:22,542 --> 00:16:26,292
FB is like a mother to me...

207
00:16:26,292 --> 00:16:28,625
"What sort of work would I have to do?"

208
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,583
I have a type of time machine.

209
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,583
The e-mail from the future is proof!

210
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,000
"Even work I could do?"

211
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:39,625
FB... made me feel needed...

212
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:44,292
"I've never had a job before.
I don't have any skills, either."

213
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,625
I've seen what happens!

214
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,375
You...

215
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,792
You...

216
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:10,500
In four days, you commit
suicide in this very room.

217
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,250
You keep waiting to hear from FB...

218
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,083
...until you die all alone in this room!

219
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,417
--You're lying.
--It's the truth!

220
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:22,292
You'll never hear from FB again!

221
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:25,042
You've been abandoned!

222
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:25,708
You're lying...

223
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,500
When's the last time FB responded?! Huh?!

224
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,458
You've been waiting all this time,
haven't you?! Odd, don't you think?!

225
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,583
You're going to die here!

226
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,667
No...

227
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:40,833
In this dark, empty room...

228
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:41,750
No...

229
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,417
...you, Mayuri's killer...

230
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:48,375
...all alone, abandoned, and
betrayed, like a piece of garbage...

231
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,167
--No...
--...end your life!

232
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:52,333
No one comes to help you!

233
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,250
Not even FB!

234
00:17:54,917 --> 00:18:00,208
No!

235
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,583
I'm sorry...

236
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,625
You said FB's like a mother.

237
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,833
Is FB a woman?

238
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,542
I think so.

239
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:49,125
You "think"?

240
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,583
We've never met...

241
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,500
I never want to...

242
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,125
I'm sure she'd hate me if we did...

243
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:03,208
Sounds like you've never
even talked on the phone.

244
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,333
How could you take orders
from someone like that?!

245
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,333
She gave me a place where I belong...

246
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,583
A place where you belong?

247
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:20,750
You're a fool!

248
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,917
Okabe?!

249
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,042
Don't worry me like that!

250
00:19:33,042 --> 00:19:35,625
You... were worried about me?

251
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,625
N-No!

252
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,333
I'm sorry.

253
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,792
So?

254
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:45,583
So the IBN 5100 was stolen by...

255
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:46,583
By Moeka.

256
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,833
Where is it now?!

257
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,292
That's all I've got.

258
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:53,458
We'll undo the D-mail as planned.

259
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:57,750
Got it. Approximately 11:00 am on July 31st.

260
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:08,000
It's activated!

261
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,375
This should do it...

262
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:26,375
Why?!

263
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,125
--Well?!
--It didn't work!

264
00:20:30,792 --> 00:20:34,417
Did the Kiryu Moeka in the
past not believe the D-mail?

265
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:37,667
Maybe she believed the
first one, just to be safe?!

266
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:40,667
Let's send another, different message!

267
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:42,333
No...

268
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,958
I think there's only
one person she'll listen to.

269
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:50,292
If we can send a message from<i> her</i>
phone, Moeka will obey without question!

270
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,292
Huh? Who are you talking about?

271
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:02,458
I'm going to look for FB.

272
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:05,292
Any idea where she might be?

273
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:07,083
I guess you wouldn't tell me anyway.

274
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:11,375
Earlier... You said I killed someone...

275
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,625
Is that in the future?

276
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:16,458
Yeah. You'd kill if FB ordered you to, right?

277
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,292
I would.

278
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:22,250
Even if you knew you were being used?!

279
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:29,167
That's how you die!
Over-dependent and abandoned!

280
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,833
In four days, on August 15!

281
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:37,167
The world has set your death
in stone! There's no escaping it!

282
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:40,833
But I refuse to accept that!

283
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:44,083
I'm going to fight the world!

284
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:48,167
I <i>will </i>save Mayuri!

285
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:04,292
The coin locker...

286
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,208
In front of the Dai Building...

287
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:13,333
The IBN 5100...

288
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:35,167
<i>With my vision restricted, there's no escape</i>

289
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:43,917
<i>from the merciless control of the twelve</i>

290
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:52,792
<i>Wishing for a tomorrow of repose,</i>

291
00:22:52,792 --> 00:23:01,500
<i>I embark for the horizon of the</i>
<i>sacred phenomenon in my hand</i>

292
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:10,125
<i>Trapped by the covenant and</i>
<i>shown the outline of false evidence</i>

293
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:19,250
<i>the heaven and earth of</i>
<i>life lets time blindly flow by</i>

294
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:28,125
<i>Flutter, butterfly, oh, miraculous</i>
<i>butterfly! I give myself to you</i>

295
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:35,292
<i>Oh, butterfly of tears,</i>
<i>dazzling butterfly! It's all...</i>

296
00:23:35,292 --> 00:24:02,070
<i>...about to be rewritten now</i>
