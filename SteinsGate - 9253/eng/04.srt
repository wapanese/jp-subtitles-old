1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,333
Let's see...

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:14,375
"Experimental result: Human is dead. Mismatch."

3
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:16,667
Human is dead?

4
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:18,125
Yeah...

5
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,583
Someone...

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,083
...died?

7
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,250
Yeah... I think so.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,125
What else does it say?!

9
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:30,583
Umm... "The details are
in Jellyman's Report #14."

10
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:33,042
Jellyman's Report? What's that?

11
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:35,083
How would I know?

12
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:38,917
But there's this strange
database on the server...

13
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:40,500
What's this?!

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,208
I think it's some kind of programming code.

15
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,417
--Daru-<i>kun</i>?
--I have no idea!

16
00:00:54,417 --> 00:00:55,917
I can't make any sense of this!

17
00:00:55,917 --> 00:00:58,917
Die! Dammit!

18
00:00:58,917 --> 00:01:02,458
Maybe we should stop.

19
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:06,333
I've finally experienced one of those,
"And I was so close too!" moments.

20
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,875
Good work. You can rest now.

21
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,167
Don't have to tell me that. I'm licked.

22
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:13,167
I got some canned <i>oden</i>, Daru-<i>kun</i>!

23
00:01:13,167 --> 00:01:14,333
Thanks.

24
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,208
Programming code...

25
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:21,500
The IBN 5100 was built
before PCs could run BASIC,

26
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,417
so it can read IBN's proprietary
programming language or something--

27
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:29,750
The IBN 5100's abilities are
needed to halt SERN's plans.

28
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,625
I'd very much like to talk with you sometime.

29
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,917
This is my e-mail address.

30
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:37,917
If you contact me, I'll reply.

So much laundry!

45
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:22,458
Yeah, with all these all-nighters,
Daru and I haven't been home yet.

46
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,833
What's more, all of Daru's
clothes--from T-shirts to underwear--

47
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,417
are size XXXL.

48
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:31,208
--Oh! It's Faris-<i>chan</i>!
--Okabe Rintaro!

49
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:34,292
Whassup!

50
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:36,458
Let me warn you.

51
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:40,000
First, my name is Hououin Kyouma.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,667
--Second, that greeting is dangerously--
--Whassup, Suzu-<i>san</i>!

53
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,208
Not you too!

54
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,167
Wait, since when do you know each other?

55
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:50,792
We share the same building.
It's natural to at least be acquaintances.

56
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:54,333
Suzu-<i>san </i>gave me this Rai-Net card!

57
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,750
A gold one!

58
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,083
Where are you going?

59
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,417
To do laundry.

60
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:02,458
Okarin and Daru-<i>kun </i>have
been up all night for days now.

61
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,292
Part-timer!

62
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:07,000
Take your work seriously or I'll fire you.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,042
Yikes...

64
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:12,458
And keep your hands off my part-timer, Okabe.

65
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:17,125
Are you sure <i>you're </i>not the
one lusting after her, Mr. Braun?

66
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:22,958
Talk like that in front of
Nae and I'll seriously kill you.

67
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,750
Nae? Oh, that little critter?

68
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,583
Don't call my daughter an animal!

69
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:32,042
Why would I lust after my
part-timer anyway?! She's just a kid!

70
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:34,917
I'm not a kid! I'm a full-fledged warrior!

71
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:35,792
Huh?

72
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:37,750
That's a nice look, part-time warrior.

73
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,458
Always remember it

74
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,583
and someday you'll change
classes and become a true warrior--

75
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,750
Be quiet. Every time you talk--

76
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,167
Really, I <i>am </i>a warrior!

77
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:52,167
Why do all the weirdos gather here?

78
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,417
Later.

79
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:56,833
We're also--

80
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:06,417
That's one of Mayuri's habits.

81
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:10,208
I've dubbed it the "Stardust Shake Hand."

82
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:20,667
I wonder if I can reach the stars...

83
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:22,958
You can't even see them.

84
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:28,708
The stars are still there
during the day too, you know.

85
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,000
Those <i>were </i>powerful EM waves.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,500
They definitely could've caused
a cell phone to malfunction.

87
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,042
But that banana...

88
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:46,542
This Phone Microwave
(Temporary Name) is a time machine!

89
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:48,292
Yeah, right.

90
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,417
Faris-<i>chan</i>...

91
00:05:58,417 --> 00:06:00,917
How did this happen to you?

92
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:04,167
--I'm closing it.
--Okay...

93
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:08,833
Daru is just like the
universe--continually expanding.

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,125
Shining Finger, huh?

95
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:17,250
What's taking Titor so long?
He told me to message him!

96
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,708
"Tell me how to contact the Super hax0r..."

97
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,250
Man, she's persistent!

98
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,792
Thank you for contacting me.

99
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:29,750
Regarding the image of the program you sent,

100
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,958
it's indeed an IBN
proprietary programming language.

101
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:38,125
To decode it, you will require an IBN 5100.

102
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,458
Listen up!

103
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:46,750
The Future Gadget Laboratory will
now initiate its top-secret emergency plan!

104
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:54,958
What's going on, Okarin?

105
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,458
Wake up, Daru!

106
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,875
Our battle with the massive secret organization

107
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,583
that rules the world from
the shadows begins now!

108
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,708
Hnn? Whazzuh...?

109
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,375
I'm talking about SERN!

110
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,667
They're a worldwide
organization bent on evil research

111
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:15,792
and the mastermind of a vast conspiracy!

112
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:19,000
The world doesn't need <i>two </i>mad scientists!

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,792
We must beat them to the
punch before they beat us!

114
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:25,667
I don't understand a thing you're saying.

115
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:29,042
First, we need to get
our hands on an IBN 5100!

116
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:32,083
Then we decode SERN's mysterious program!

117
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:37,292
--Prepare to depart!
--But Mayushii has work today...

118
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:42,583
So it's all up to me now...

119
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:48,750
Trading information might be an idea...

120
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,208
Oh, Assistant.

121
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,292
Not so fast.

122
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:01,375
--What do you want?!
--Come with me.

123
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,417
H-Hey!

124
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,458
You messed up the shoulder part here...

125
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,833
"Almost no info here."

126
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,875
Useless louse!

127
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:17,042
--So why are you glaring at <i>me</i>?
--Fear not. You aren't the cause.

128
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:19,458
I'd appreciate you not taking
your frustration out on me.

129
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,458
Sulking, are we?

130
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:25,042
Mayuri was worried that you might be cross.

131
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:28,917
You're too old to be
acting like a kid, you know.

132
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:31,750
You're in absolutely no position to talk.

133
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,958
Anyway, what did you want to talk about?

134
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,583
It's simple.

135
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,625
Quit sulking and come back
to the lab to work, Christina.

136
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,333
You can at <i>least </i>stick to calling me one name.

137
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,167
Listen when people are talking, The Zombie!

138
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:45,375
<i>You're </i>the one not listening here!

139
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,375
How did I ever get involved with this guy?

140
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:53,542
I want to punch myself for
being so curious back then.

141
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:55,000
Wha...? <i>Again</i>?!

142
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,917
Are those messages that annoying?

143
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:59,458
It's absolutely insane how--

144
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,458
Wait, could she be an Organization agent too?!

145
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,292
Organization? What's that?

146
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:05,667
The Organization is the Organization!

147
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:09,750
A secret, transnational organization that
controls the world from the shadows and--

148
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,417
Sounds like an average
conspiracy theory. Thank you very--

149
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:16,417
--What's wrong?
--N-Nothing.

150
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,000
Really! It's nothing!

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,833
Keep asking me and I'll slug you!

152
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,917
Lashing out, huh? Come with me.

153
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:29,542
I'll give you your mission...
after we retrieve the laundry.

154
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:30,708
Huh?

155
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,250
Do you honestly think I'll just blindly follow--

156
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,583
Laundry?

157
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:38,417
Oh, so this is where it is.

158
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:40,417
You don't have one at the hotel?

159
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:42,917
No, it's a pretty fancy hotel.

160
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:48,500
But it's not my style to send
everything I wear out for cleaning.

161
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,708
You found it, thanks to me.

162
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,625
Be grateful and--

163
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,917
--Still no change?
--Of course not.

164
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:57,125
You don't think spinning will
cause something to happen, do you?

165
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:02,250
The answer is often hidden
in what seems most obvious.

166
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,000
Who would've imagined hooking
a phone up to a microwave...

167
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,917
--...would produce a time machine--
--It's not a time machine!

168
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:09,042
Huh?

169
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,125
It's some kind of mistake!

170
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:15,708
Time machines are nothing but pseudoscience.

171
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,583
I refuse to have any part of it.

172
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:22,000
Why do you insist on denying what you saw?

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,958
I'm not.

174
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,583
Could it be due to past trauma?!

175
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,500
Yes, when she was five,

176
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,667
Christina was struck by
lightning on the plains of Arkansas--

177
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:33,875
No, I wasn't.

178
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,375
Then why?

179
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:39,125
I already explained why.
It's theoretically impossible.

180
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:42,250
Theories are nothing more
than lexical entertainment.

181
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,000
Just accept what you saw.

182
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,292
No.

183
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:50,958
--Why are you so stubborn to--
--I said no!

184
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,292
I won't...

185
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:56,125
I won't repeat my father's failure!

186
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,667
I'm sorry. I got emotional.

187
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:07,458
Don't worry about it!

188
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:12,167
I purposely angered you
to ascertain how you think--

189
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:19,333
Anyway, the Phone
Microwave is <i>not </i>a time machine.

190
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,042
Understood.

191
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:24,042
I apologize for forcing you to join our lab.

192
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:26,208
You needn't come anymore.

193
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,542
But I <i>will </i>tell you this...

194
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:32,583
The title of Lab Member 004
will be set aside forever.

195
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,792
That number will always be yours.

196
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:38,500
Quit trying to act cool!

197
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,208
What's the big idea?!
That was the perfect farewell speech!

198
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,708
And it annoys me!

199
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:46,208
You still have laundry here. <i>I'll </i>leave.

200
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,125
Bye.

201
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,542
--What?!
--That's payback.

202
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:55,333
I suggest you reflect on the error of your ways.

203
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,125
Yeah, fine. Bye.

204
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,250
Wait.

205
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,542
Quit grabbing me there!

206
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:03,375
Do you know anything about the IBN 5100?

207
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,792
IBN?

208
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,792
An old PC.

209
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:10,042
--What are you going to use it for?
--Curious to know?

210
00:12:13,292 --> 00:12:14,792
You are, aren't you?

211
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:16,417
Urgh...

212
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:19,625
Just a little.

213
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:23,542
The IBN 5100 is connected to SERN's secrets.

214
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:24,708
Huh?

215
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:28,542
SERN is researching time travel,

216
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:35,083
and we need the IBN 5100's unique
functionality to decode their secret program.

217
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:38,583
Well? Are you shocked?

218
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,542
Ridiculous. What a waste of time.

219
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:43,083
Y-You scoffed at me!

220
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,583
Curse you!

221
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:47,333
Well, I'll show you!

222
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:51,375
Just you wait, Christina!

223
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,542
I told you not to call me that...

224
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:59,167
--SERN is researching time travel...
--We need the IBN 5100's unique functionality...

225
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:02,042
What nerve. I only told her
'cause she said she was curious...

226
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,083
A PC?

227
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,125
Yeah, an old one.

228
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:09,292
I think it costs 5100 yen or something...

229
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:12,792
5100? Could you mean...?

230
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,958
Too-too-roo!

231
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:22,792
Guess what, Okarin! Mayushii
found out something amazing!

232
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:28,208
--No cell phones.
--Faris-<i>chan </i>said she's seen the PC you're looking for!

233
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,500
No cell phones!

234
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:37,583
H-Hey!

235
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,708
Geez...

236
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,417
You didn't leave enough!

237
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:51,833
Faris Meow-Meow! Faris Meow-Meow!
Faris Meow-Meow! Faris Meow-Meow!

238
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,375
What is <i>this</i>?!

239
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,083
Everyone!

240
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,417
Thanks for coming, meow!

241
00:13:57,417 --> 00:14:00,042
We're about to start the daytime Faris Cup!

242
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:02,125
Try your hardest to beat Faris

243
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:06,167
and win an order of special
Meow-Meow Omelet Rice!

244
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,500
Faris Meow-Meow! Faris Meow-Meow!

245
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,542
Wh-What dimension <i>is </i>this?

246
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:17,125
Oh, Okarin!

247
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,958
Too-too-roo!

248
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,583
Mayuri...

249
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,667
What's going on here?
Was there a space-time distortion?!

250
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:25,708
No, it's the Faris Cup!

251
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:26,708
Huh?

252
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:30,750
Faris-<i>chan </i>is going to play
Rai-Net Battler with all the visitors here!

253
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,000
Oh, Kyouma!

254
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,958
Are you going to compete too?

255
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,917
Faris can play against
up to ten people at a time!

256
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:40,125
--So it's not too late--
--I refuse!

257
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:43,625
Never mind that! The IBN 5100! Where is it?!

258
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,625
Well...

259
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,917
I'll tell you if you compete.

260
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:50,208
Don't be stupid!

261
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,792
The future of the world's
structure hangs in the balance!

262
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:58,292
--A silly game isn't--
--I'm sorry, then. Please leave.

263
00:14:58,292 --> 00:15:01,500
A lowly maid is telling her master to leave?!

264
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,583
--The IBN 5100--
--Can't hear you!

265
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,625
I'm in a hurry.

266
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,750
I'm sorry, but I won't hold anything back.

267
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,375
Meow, meow. You're really
confident in yourself, meow.

268
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,792
Can you win, Okarin?

269
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:17,208
Faris-<i>tan </i>is a top national player, you know...

270
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,292
"Can you win?"

271
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:22,125
You should ask <i>Faris </i>that question.

272
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:25,083
I have a surefire,
infallible strategy up my sleeve!

273
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,708
A strategy?

274
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,167
Strategy Code...

275
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:33,417
K.B.O.O.M.!

276
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:36,042
Otherwise known as K-Boom!

277
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:37,667
Oh!

278
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:39,500
That sounds awesome!

279
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,083
Interesting.

280
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,083
Act tough now, while you still can.

281
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:50,750
For when this strategy detonates,
you may very well lose your life!

282
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,833
You're serious about this, Kyouma.

283
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,375
Just so we're clear...

284
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:59,333
Once I've participated,
you'll tell me everything you know.

285
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,500
All right?

286
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,917
Cat ears never lie.

287
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:03,917
I challenge you!

288
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:07,667
Now you'll learn there are some
opponents you can never beat!

289
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,958
--I surrender!
--That was fast!

290
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,542
Mayushii is disappointed.

291
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:13,583
What the hell strategy was that?

292
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,667
I'm not sure.

293
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:19,083
But Kyouma kept charging at me,
like he <i>wanted </i>to go kaboom.

294
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,250
Kaboom?

295
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,792
K-Boom...

296
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:23,292
K-Boom?

297
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:25,875
Thank you very much
for that terrible word play.

298
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,083
--However!
--WTF?!

299
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,583
--Now tell me what you know, Faris!
--He recovers fast!

300
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:32,417
You're stuck-up for someone who lost.

301
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:36,583
I told you I'd participate only
if you told me what you know.

302
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:40,125
In other words, winning never
mattered to me from the start.

303
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,417
Is that right?

304
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,917
I don't really remember...

305
00:16:42,917 --> 00:16:45,917
Remember it! It was an ingenious strategy!

306
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:48,583
Ingenious? More like underhanded, I'd say...

307
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,667
Shut up!

308
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:51,875
Where's the IBN 5100?!

309
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,417
--I don't know...
--You don't?!

310
00:16:54,417 --> 00:17:00,583
I know Daddy had one when
I was little, but it's gone now.

311
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:01,833
Curses!

312
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,583
Is that the secret sidestepping
technique you mastered

313
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,375
in the Guiana Highlands?!

314
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,542
How did you know?!

315
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:14,208
Well done, Kyouma. You saw
right through my Ignoring Shoulder.

316
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,583
Is that really all?

317
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:24,333
Yeah. The last time I saw it
was at a shrine in Akihabara.

318
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,083
A shrine?

319
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:29,583
"Kurisu. Thank you for messaging
me all the way from Japan."

320
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:33,500
"Regarding your query,
I consulted the professor and he said

321
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:40,875
that the IBN 5100 could indeed
analyze special programming languages."

322
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,708
He was telling the truth?

323
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,250
Huh? A PC?

324
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,708
I'd have to ask my father...

325
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,667
It's an IBN 5100.

326
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:57,583
If he doesn't recognize the name,
just say it's an old computer.

327
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,875
Okay, I'll ask him.

328
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:00,750
I'm counting on you.

329
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,417
Now end with the code phrase...

330
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:05,500
E-El Psy Congree...?

331
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,125
Congroo!

332
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:11,333
Hello?

333
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,667
It's me, Makise.

334
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:14,083
Makise?

335
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,833
Sorry, doesn't ring a bell. Where did we meet?

336
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,375
Paris? London?

337
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,958
Akihabara. I just saw you!

338
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,875
Oh, is that you, Assistant?

339
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,792
You should've just said it's Christina.

340
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:27,083
Don't call me that!

341
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,250
Man, you're as loud and annoying as ever.

342
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,417
Only because of a certain someone else!

343
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:33,542
What do you want?

344
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:34,750
Where are you?

345
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,750
Why?

346
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,375
No reason.

347
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,917
I'm just on my way to Yanabayashi Shrine to--

348
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:46,333
What?! Was that just a prank call?! Was it?!

349
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,167
What was with that phone call?

350
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:50,292
All I wanted was your location.

351
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:52,583
I don't remember anyone asking you here.

352
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,250
No one did.

353
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:58,000
Sorry to keep you waiting!

354
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,500
Oh, did you ask him?!

355
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:05,125
Yes! My father said
there's one of those PCs here!

356
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,875
--Really?!
--A PC...?

357
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,250
Do you mean an IBN 5100?!

358
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,292
Yes.

359
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:14,042
--Umm, who might she be?
--My assistant.

360
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:16,250
--So, the IBN--
--Hold on!

361
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,167
What kind of offhand introduction is that?!

362
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,292
Besides, I'm <i>not </i>your assistant!

363
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:24,750
I didn't come here to introduce you!

364
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,083
It wouldn't even take ten seconds!

365
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,500
Geez, you're annoying.

366
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,375
This is Makise Kurisu. My assistant.

367
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:34,333
Fine, whatever. I'm your assistant.

368
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,583
So who are you?

369
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,875
I-I'm Urushibara Ruka.

370
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,250
How old are you?

371
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,542
--I turn seventeen this year.
--That's one year younger than me...

372
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:44,958
Oh, really?

373
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,417
You look so grown-up and mature, Makise-<i>san</i>.

374
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:48,333
And pretty.

375
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,792
Oh, no. You're much prettier.

376
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:55,875
Huh? U-Umm... I'll go get my father!

377
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,750
Ignorance is bliss, as they say.

378
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,542
What do you mean?

379
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:04,708
Wow, I can't believe it really happened...

380
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,792
Wh-What do you mean?

381
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:11,042
Well, you see, the person who
donated this computer also said

382
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:17,500
to take good care of it, for a young
man in need of it would someday appear.

383
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,375
About ten years ago, I'd say?

384
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,917
I see.

385
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:25,000
This is truly a coincidence of fate...

386
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,750
The choice of Steins Gate!

387
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,792
Not that again...

388
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:38,417
IBN 5100 Portable Computer.

389
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:39,875
No doubt about it.

390
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,208
Is that what you're looking for?

391
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,417
Umm, could we possibly borrow it?!

392
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:46,667
Of course.

393
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:48,208
Thank you!

394
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,125
--Assistant! Haul this back!
--No u.

395
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,875
What kind of assistant are you, Christina?!

396
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,875
I'm <i>not </i>your assistant! And don't call me that!

397
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,667
I'll go get a cart.

398
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:00,542
Oh, no, we couldn't ask any more of you!

399
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:03,458
Hey, Assistant! Take a hint, will you?!

400
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:08,500
Huh?! <i>You're </i>telling <i>me </i>to talk a hint?!

401
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,625
You're certainly good friends, I see.

402
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,333
Be a good friend to them too, Ruka.

403
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,417
Right!

404
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:18,125
Wait here a moment.

405
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,917
You have a nice father.

406
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:24,042
Do you think so?

407
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:27,542
I won't repeat my father's failure!

408
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:30,500
What?

409
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,667
Nothing.

410
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,208
I'm sorry!

411
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,417
The cart seems to be broken...

412
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:42,667
How did I get stuck doing this with you?!

413
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:46,292
Just shut up and carry it.
We've still a long way to go!

414
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,042
--Say...
--What?

415
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:53,833
Never mind!

416
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:57,750
What's with the attitude, you?!

417
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,500
Hey! Wait! You're making me walk backwards!

418
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,625
Walk briskly, Assistant!

419
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,167
I can't! I can't do this walking backwards!

420
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:07,875
I know you can do it, Assistant!

421
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,458
Thank you for the encouragement! But I can't!

422
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,333
I request we walk sideways!

423
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:15,958
No, we<i> have </i>to! Or I'm gonna fall!
