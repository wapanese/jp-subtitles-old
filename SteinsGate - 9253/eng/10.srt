1
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:09,375
How?

2
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,250
What's going on?!

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,167
Akiba is completely devoid of "<i>moe</i>" now?!

4
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:17,750
--Wait up, Okarin!
--Okarin... Oka--

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,250
--What's gotten into you?
--Okarin... Oka--

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,208
Where did Toranoana and Animate go?!

7
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,125
Where's Mandarake and Gamers?!

8
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:28,417
What are you talking about, Okarin?
You know there aren't any in Akiba.

9
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:30,875
That's why Mayushii has
to go all the way to Nakano--

10
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:34,958
Mayuri! You work
part-time at May Queen, right?!

11
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,958
What's "May Queen"?

12
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:39,125
May Queen NyanÂ²!

13
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,375
That can't be...

14
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,000
Faris was the one who asked

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,125
for <i>moe </i>culture to be
introduced into Akiba, meow!

16
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:52,708
Did she send a D-mail
back in time to undo that?

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,042
An entire city, completely
altered by one e-mail...

18
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,958
<i>suu juuoku mono kodou no kazu sae</i>

26
00:01:58,542 --> 00:02:00,792

<i>nomi komarete yuku kodoku no kansokusha</i>

31
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,333
It's hard to believe
May Queen once stood here.

32
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,625
May Queen? Like the potato?

33
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:54,333
Summer's all about cold dipping
noodles, not buttered potatoes.

34
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,958
I'm <i>not </i>talking about potatoes here--

35
00:02:56,958 --> 00:03:01,375
If May Queen doesn't exist,
how did we meet Faris?

36
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:07,292
Actually, buttered potato
ramen <i>is </i>how we met Faris-<i>tan</i>.

37
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:08,292
What do you mean?!

38
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:10,000
You forgot?

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,708
The day of the Rai-Net
competition in Ikebukuro,

40
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:16,042
I got a stomachache from the
buttered potato ramen I had for lunch

41
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:17,667
and had to drop out.

42
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:18,375
And then?!

43
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,583
You and Mayushii competed in my place

44
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:24,417
and squared off against Faris-<i>tan</i>.

45
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:26,625
You got your butts kicked,

46
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:30,667
but she and Mayushii have
been friends ever since, remember?

47
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:32,542
I see...

48
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:34,042
Look, Ruka-<i>chan</i>!

49
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:36,958
I bought this cosplayer
photo book in Nakano yesterday!

50
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:40,083
--Wow! That's so cute!
--So even though the past has changed,

51
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:45,333
our relationships are
still essentially the same?

52
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:48,667
You seem to have a lot of time
on your hands this Obon holiday,

53
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:49,917
Lab Member Girls.

54
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:51,750
Hello!

55
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,167
--Cute, huh?!
--Oh!

56
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,792
It's Sedona from Blood Tune!

57
00:03:56,792 --> 00:04:00,083
Look how detailed it is!
There's a swimsuit version, too!

58
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:03,708
I wish I could be as stylish as her.

59
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:08,125
Don't worry about it! Small boobs are just!

60
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:11,875
Oh, I know! We should all
go to the beach sometime!

61
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,667
Kurisu-<i>chan </i>too!

62
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,625
Can you all wear school swimsuits?

63
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,333
Me, swim with these perverts?

64
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,000
Aww...

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,875
O-Oh, but I'd be more than happy
to come along if it's a girls-only thing!

66
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,375
Just admit it, Christina.

67
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:34,583
You just don't want us to see
the birthmark on your rump.

68
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,333
--Am I right?
--I-I don't have a birthmark!

69
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:42,542
Besides, if it <i>were </i>a girls-only
thing, then Rukako here couldn't go.

70
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:44,208
Huh? Why not?

71
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:48,583
I told you the other day--Rukako
is an honest-to-goodness boy.

72
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,208
Huh?

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,208
Wha...?

74
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,833
Huh?

75
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,917
You're pathetic.

76
00:05:01,917 --> 00:05:04,542
Calling a girl a boy...

77
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:07,708
Mayushii doesn't like it
when you act like that...

78
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,083
Definitely crossed the line.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,542
H-H-Hold on! Why are you crying?!

80
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:17,292
Apologize to Urushibara-<i>san </i>right this minute!

81
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:20,250
Wh-What for? I'm telling the truth--

82
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,875
It's okay!

83
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:25,792
Is that how you've
always seen me, Okabe-<i>san</i>?

84
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:29,250
--Hold on, Rukako! You're a guy--
--How long are you going to keep this up?!

85
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,208
I should go!

86
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,375
Wait!

87
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,917
Quit fooling with me!
You're a guy and you know it!

88
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:37,958
Seriously, you even have a--

89
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,250
It's gone... It's gone...

90
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,458
It's gone!

91
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:46,000
Okabe-<i>san</i>... Please stop...

92
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,125
Rukako...

93
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,708
You're... a girl?

94
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,500
That's what we've...

95
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,542
...been telling you!

96
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,417
Yo-yo-yo!

97
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:02,042
What's wrong?

98
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:03,500
Oh, it's nothing.

99
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,625
--Just tortured a little...
--Tortured?!

100
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,083
By Makise Kurisu?!

101
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:11,292
Yeah... But I cleared
up our misunderstanding.

102
00:06:11,292 --> 00:06:12,125
...I hope.

103
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,667
She hurt your legs?!

104
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:17,167
Y-You mustn't touch them yet!

105
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,792
She forced me to sit on my knees for an hour--

106
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:24,542
No, I mean, I was tortured.

107
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:28,333
Oh, that doesn't count as torture.

108
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:32,417
You sound like someone
who's been through real torture.

109
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:34,833
Well, I <i>am </i>a warrior!

110
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:44,458
This is the perfect day to go cycling...

111
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,375
Is it?

112
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:52,667
Say... want to go cycling?

113
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:04,208
Y-You call <i>this </i>cycling...?!

114
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:11,542
I haven't told you this, but
I actually came to Tokyo to find my dad.

115
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:13,083
Find?

116
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,042
Did he run away or something?

117
00:07:15,042 --> 00:07:19,250
I haven't seen him in years. I don't
even remember what he looks like.

118
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,333
I just know he's in this city.

119
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:27,583
This is my only clue: A pin he once had.

120
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:32,458
Then this is no time to
be working a part-time job.

121
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:37,667
It's hard to explain, but
I basically only have one shot at it.

122
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:39,542
Huh?

123
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:43,875
I think my dad might show
up at a certain place tomorrow.

124
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:49,417
But if I miss that chance,
I'll have to leave the city.

125
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:51,875
There's somewhere else I need to go.

126
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,958
I'm pretty busy myself, you see.

127
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:59,958
My plan was that if it doesn't work
out, I'll just give up looking for him.

128
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:03,458
So you're ill at ease.

129
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:06,125
I know that feeling all too well.

130
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,125
However!

131
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,625
Unfortunately, Part-time Warrior,

132
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:15,208
you just shared your
story with a mad scientist!

133
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:19,125
As of today, you are Lab Member 008!

134
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,583
You will be our guinea pig!

135
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:26,000
--Wh-What are you going to do?
--Change the past.

136
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,167
Feel free to think it a fiendish plot.

137
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:30,708
But there is no escaping it now.

138
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:35,250
You will send a D-mail to
your father before he absconded.

139
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,625
One that says, "Don't leave your daughter."

140
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,708
You're a nice guy.

141
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:44,917
What?!

142
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:51,167
I somehow feel a little better.

143
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:53,083
Well, I gotta get back.

144
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,042
Thanks for being concerned about me!

145
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:57,125
Listen!

146
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,708
Promise you'll come to the lab tomorrow,
whether or not you meet your dad!

147
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:04,958
We'll conduct a D-mail
experiment using your grief!

148
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,583
You're a mad scientist, all right!

149
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,208
You're cruel and heartless!

150
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:25,625
I will now explain the
basics of Operation Eldhrimnir.

151
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,667
Again with the Norse myths?

152
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:31,417
If the part-time warrior
finds her father, we'll celebrate

153
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:34,125
by holding a "Last Supper in Tokyo" for her.

154
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,458
If she <i>doesn't </i>find her
father, we hold a pity party

155
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,583
and then conduct our D-mail experiment.

156
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,083
Huh? Daru-<i>kun </i>isn't here.

157
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,292
He said he can't make it 'cause
of a meet-up with online friends

158
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:47,333
or some such nonsense.

159
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,375
But I've already taken measures.

160
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,750
I sent this message ahead of time.

161
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:57,458
"The choice is yours: Faris'
home cooking or your meet-up?"

162
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:00,917
Oh? But I thought Faris-<i>chan </i>couldn't come?

163
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:05,042
I can let Faris off the hook since
she's never met the part-time warrior,

164
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:07,458
but Daru is duty-bound to
participate in this operation.

165
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:12,917
Umm, I've never met this
Suzuha-<i>san </i>either, actually...

166
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:14,167
No matter!

167
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:17,250
You girls will do the
shopping for our little party.

168
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,375
What about you?

169
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:22,292
I'm going to follow the part-time
warrior and report in detail.

170
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:26,208
Don't do that. Just let
them have some time alone.

171
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,583
Yeah! You can come
shopping with us, Okarin!

172
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,417
--I'm going to follow--
--Did you not just hear me?!

173
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:36,292
You're my assistant!
You don't get to order me--

174
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:40,000
Feel like sitting on your knees again?
For three hours this time.

175
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,083
Well, then! Let's get ready for the party!

176
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,458
What's the matter, Okarin?

177
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,542
I-It's nothing...

178
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,583
What in the...?

179
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,125
Should we get mild curry?
Or should we get spicy?

180
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,042
Which do you think she'd like?

181
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:27,375
O-Oh. Spicy is fine.

182
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,875
Oh, right! Suzu-<i>san is</i>
a part-time warrior and all!

183
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:34,292
And warriors love spicy food!

184
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:38,125
Let's see... Next is meat!

185
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:42,500
Wow, beef is so expensive!

186
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,958
Say, Okarin. You don't seem yourself.

187
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,250
I kind of expected you to say,

188
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,000
"The Organization's sabotage
has caused beef prices to skyrocket!

189
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,250
When does Operation Bargain Sale begin?!"

190
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,792
...Or something like that.

191
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:05,792
I would've used Norse mythology
for the name, not "Bargain Sale."

192
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:06,833
It's me.

193
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:10,042
Due to Organization
sabotage, Operation Audumbla

194
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:12,417
has incurred unforeseen expenses.

195
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:16,000
I request additional operational funds.

196
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,625
Oh! The first star of the night!

197
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,125
Venus, huh...

198
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,125
Hey, Okarin.

199
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:32,500
Remember in grade school when you
were stuck in bed with that terrible fever?

200
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,667
Yeah.

201
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:37,917
It was right around the time
everyone was freaking out about Y2K...

202
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:45,417
Mayushii was actually
really afraid you'd die.

203
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:49,167
So I prayed to the sky!

204
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:54,333
And then suddenly a
shooting star went flying by!

205
00:12:54,333 --> 00:13:00,458
Mayushii chanted, "Please
don't die, Okarin!" to it three times!

206
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:05,625
The next day, your fever was
gone and you were wide awake!

207
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:10,167
So you owe Mayushii for saving your life!

208
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:11,792
No, you got it wrong.

209
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:15,375
It was the choice of
Steins Gate that I survived.

210
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,667
Aww. Really?

211
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:20,083
Really.

212
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,250
Oh.

213
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:28,292
Say, do you remember what you said
after you collapsed from your fever?

214
00:13:28,292 --> 00:13:31,875
You said that everything looked mixed up,

215
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,500
that you were too dizzy to stand,

216
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,958
and that you felt like you'd been shocked.

217
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:42,458
That's how you seemed
back at Faris-<i>chan</i>'s place too.

218
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:46,167
That feeling I had when I had that fever...

219
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:50,625
It was just like how
I feel when I move world lines.

220
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:58,417
Was that when I first gained
my Reading Steiner ability?

221
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,250
We're back!

222
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,833
Welcome back!

223
00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:07,458
What's that smell?

224
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:11,000
It's probably Kurisu-<i>san</i>'s apple pie...

225
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,667
What?! <i>This </i>stench?!

226
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:14,625
Can Mayushii help?

227
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,542
You <i>could </i>boil some eggs...

228
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:17,917
Sure!

229
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:19,792
Let's see...

230
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,333
Do you think I could
use the Phone Microwave?

231
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:26,000
D-Don't! Raw eggs explode in microwaves!

232
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,625
--I can cook it.
--Aww...

233
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,667
You can cut up some
mushrooms then, Mayuri.

234
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:32,125
Okay!

235
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,125
H-Hold on!

236
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,917
Boiled eggs and mushrooms
don't go in apple pies!

237
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,833
They're for a side-salad.

238
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:41,542
Uhh, I don't think egg and mushroom
salad goes with apple pie either...

239
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:43,875
--Chop! Chop! Chop!
--You there!

240
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,833
--Quit chopping mushrooms!
--Move!

241
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,500
It's me.

242
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,417
It appears I've inadvertently freed an evil god.

243
00:14:54,417 --> 00:15:00,958
If I don't call within the next
hour, tell my parents I loved them.

244
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,458
Okabe-<i>san</i>. Do you have a rice cooker?

245
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:08,292
Faris-<i>tan</i>! Wherefore art thou, Faris-<i>tan</i>?!

246
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:11,000
You've been tricked, Hashida.

247
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,125
Faris-<i>san </i>said she couldn't come.

248
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,792
S-Serious?!

249
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:15,917
Okarin!

250
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:18,417
I'll talk to her about it next chance I get!

251
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,375
What the hell, man?!

252
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,417
I missed my time machine
forum meeting for this!

253
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:24,167
Time machine forum meeting?

254
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:28,750
With people from a sci-fi BBS I frequent.

255
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,917
A professional writer was gonna come, even!

256
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:34,292
This is a neat-looking camping kit!

257
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:36,417
--Don't touch that! That's no camping kit!
--Hmm, how does it open?

258
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:38,667
--It's Future Gadget #4: Moad Snake!
--Hmm, how does it open?

259
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:39,792
A Claymore mine?!

260
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:42,625
Just a replica. It's a super-instant humidifier.

261
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,458
Oh, here we are!

262
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,083
S-Stop!

263
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,625
I'm so sorry, Okabe-<i>san</i>...

264
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,750
What's done is done.

265
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,667
Just watch what you touch from now on.

266
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:06,417
Hey, couldn't we use this?

267
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,833
A vacuum cleaner?

268
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,792
Nope! It's Future Gadget #3!

269
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:13,167
Or was it #2?

270
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:14,250
#5.

271
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:19,125
Known as "I've Connected Yet
Another Trifling Thing - By Goemon."

272
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:23,750
It's basically a hair drier that uses
the heat exhaust of a vacuum cleaner.

273
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,542
Hand it here.

274
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:26,250
Wait!

275
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,792
You have to unplug
everything else first, or else--!

276
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,000
...the breaker will trip.

277
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,125
Huh? Where's the flashlight again?

278
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,750
I-Is this it?!

279
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,167
No, Miss Ruka. That's a daikon.

280
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,167
Let's see... Where's the breaker?

281
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:45,500
Hey! Don't go wandering around!

282
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:48,833
Told you so.

283
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,375
Oww...

284
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,417
The breaker's by the front door.

285
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:56,875
You okay?

286
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:03,333
What's so funny?!

287
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,333
Sorry! It's just...

288
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:13,792
My laboratory back in America
has top talent from all over the world,

289
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:18,500
but they're all so arrogant and callous.

290
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:24,792
Your lab is childish by comparison,
but I feel like I really fit in.

291
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:28,958
Th-That's not a compliment, though!

292
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:33,583
I'm just saying that's how it seems...

293
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:37,750
For me, I guess I just wanted some friends.

294
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:47,042
I, umm... consider you a friend.

295
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:53,208
You said before that you
cherish me as a friend too.

296
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:56,708
That actually made me pretty happy...

297
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,667
Do you have a fever or something?

298
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:03,833
N-No!

299
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,750
What's your problem?! I was just
starting to rethink my opinion of you!

300
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,917
You dummy!

301
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:22,750
Suzu-<i>san</i>'s sure taking a long time.

302
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,042
I wonder if she found her father...

303
00:18:25,042 --> 00:18:28,542
I bet they're spending quality
time together as we speak.

304
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:33,208
Either way, I clearly told
her to come to the lab...

305
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,708
But it's pretty late now.

306
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:39,458
The operation's off. You guys can go.

307
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:55,042
Why, that little...!

308
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:06,792
Is she just going to leave
like that, sad and all alone?

309
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:11,250
Hououin Kyouma will not allow it!

310
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,500
Damn!

311
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,167
Where is she?!

312
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,167
I got it.

313
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:26,042
I can use a D-mail to tell myself to
follow Suzuha this afternoon at all costs!

314
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:27,458
But...

315
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,750
Can I really afford to send any more D-mails

316
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,583
and alter the past even more?

317
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,750
You're a nice guy.

318
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,667
I somehow feel a little better.

319
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:47,917
I'm Hououin Kyouma, the mad scientist.

320
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:51,083
Nothing strikes fear in <i>my </i>heart!

321
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,333
"Ignore assistant..."

322
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,958
"...tail Suzuha!"

323
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,583
Yo.

324
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,542
Morning, Part-time Warrior! Slacking off?

325
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:41,667
Yeah, that party went way
into the night. I'm so sleepy...

326
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:47,208
Last night, we held a "Last Supper"
where you acted as our test subject

327
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,583
since you never found your father.

328
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,167
Correct?

329
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,667
Yeah, but we never did the experiment

330
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:57,083
because I didn't know
my dad's e-mail address.

331
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,458
I'd like to double-check one thing...

332
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:03,500
How did I get you to come?

333
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,125
Did you drink last night?

334
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,875
You're underage.
You know better than that.

335
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,000
Just tell me.

336
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,167
Well, I was leaving my time
machine forum meeting when...

337
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:17,583
Time machine forum meeting?!

338
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:21,625
Was that where you thought
your father might show up?!

339
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:25,583
Yeah. My dad goes by the name "Titor."

340
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,208
John Titor?!

341
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:30,583
No, Barrel. Barrel Titor.

342
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,833
I told you yesterday, remember?

343
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,292
Didn't you record it on your phone?

344
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,625
Yesterday was so much fun!

345
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:44,375
It would've been even more fun

Her apple pie tasted like death.

347
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:52,042
But Urushibara Ruka's curry was top-notch!

348
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:55,167
You guys have a nice lab!

349
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:58,458
You get along great
and are always having fun.

350
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:02,583
That was the first time in my
life I ever felt like I really fit in.

351
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:06,833
Then feel free to visit anytime you want.

352
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,167
You <i>are </i>a lab member and all.

353
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:10,208
Yeah.

354
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:15,167
I think I'll keep looking for
my dad for a little while longer.
