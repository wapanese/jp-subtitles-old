1
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:11,000
If we return to the beta world line...

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,917
...Makise Kurisu...

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,875
...will die.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,292
--I'm gonna run the hack now.
--Wait!

5
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:21,292
The hacking...

6
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,750
...is canceled.

7
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:43,875
<i>For you, billions and billions of heartbeats</i>

8
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:50,542
<i>are nothing at all; just the blink of an eye</i>

9
00:00:50,542 --> 00:00:55,750
<i>Although I'm trapped by</i>
<i>the past and lament the future</i>

10
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:01,667
<i>inevitability won't allow for</i>
<i>even a speck of a miscalculation</i>

11
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:07,792
<i>Our dreams and futures that</i>
<i>form and expand into "infinity"</i>

12
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:13,667
<i>allow us the right to be vain,</i>

13
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:19,875
<i>while the two hands</i>
<i>point out what is "finite"</i>

14
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:24,458
<i>All of which leads to a cruel</i>
<i>contract and choice to make</i>

15
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,708
<i>Hacking to the Gate</i>

16
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:33,625
<i>So, now, with each passing</i>
<i>second, I'll cross world lines</i>

17
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:38,542
<i>to protect that smile on your face</i>

18
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:45,542
<i>Then, once again, into a</i>
<i>time loop without sadness</i>

19
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:52,250
<i>I will be swallowed up as a lone observer</i>

20
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,125
Where's Okabe?

21
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,292
Unknown! I've been busy!

22
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:11,083
--Well, good luck to you, Mayushii!
--And to you, Daru-<i>kun</i>!

23
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,833
Aye!

24
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,750
--Is today the last day of Comima?
--Yeah.

25
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,375
Do you want to come too?
There'll be lots of girls doing cute cosplays!

26
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:23,792
I-I'm not interested in that sort of thing...

27
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,750
I wonder what Okarin's up to.

28
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,542
Beats me. He called off
the hack and then just left...

29
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:33,792
Who knows <i>what </i>he's thinking...

30
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:42,042
It's supposed to get up to 35ยบ Celsius today!

31
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:47,000
It's important to keep
hydrated or you'll get heat stroke!

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,583
Aren't you going to Comima today?

33
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,958
Yeah. I'm just about to leave.

34
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,125
I see. Be careful.

35
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,750
Right!

36
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,208
The sun's really strong today.

37
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,792
See you later! Too-too-roo!

38
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,583
Mayuri...!

39
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:15,458
August 17th...

40
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:21,042
Each D-mail I've undone has
pushed Mayuri's death one day back.

41
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:23,917
It started out on the 13th

42
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:26,917
and moved to the 14th when
Suzuha's message was undone.

43
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:29,583
Faris... Rukako... Moeka...

44
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:33,250
If each one has delayed it by a day,

45
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,542
then Mayuri will die on
the 17th on this world line.

46
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:39,792
Today, just before 8:00 pm.

47
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:41,542
That's the deadline...

48
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:43,167
Okarin!

49
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,250
Find what you were looking for?

50
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,875
Yeah! They were almost sold out, too!

51
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,833
I even snagged some for Daru-<i>kun</i>!

52
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:56,708
Oh, I also saw a book about
robot anime I bet you'd like!

53
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,792
Want to see?

54
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:00,708
No, that's okay.

55
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,250
Why not? You're here and all...

56
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,083
I just... have some things on my mind.

57
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,583
Oh.

58
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,708
If there's anywhere you
wanna see, just let me know!

59
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,333
Yeah.

60
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,125
Are you okay?

61
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,875
Do you want to leave?

62
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,500
D-Don't be silly!

63
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,042
I just meant I'm concerned

64
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:24,208
about the Organization
assassins lurking at this venue.

65
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,000
We <i>must </i>outfox them somehow.

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,583
They might spot us if we aren't careful.

67
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,417
We will proceed as planned until evening falls.

68
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:35,750
I don't think there's anyone<i> that </i>bad here.

69
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,333
I'm going scouting.

70
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,375
Reconvene here at 1500 hours. Understood?

71
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay!

72
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:47,042
Okarin! They're selling drinks and
stuff over there, just so you know!

73
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:48,708
Five hours left...

74
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,042
Don't give up.

75
00:04:50,042 --> 00:04:52,333
You <i>have </i>to find it before then...

76
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:56,917
A way for Mayuri to survive
without changing world lines.

77
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:06,500
Huh?! Why do I have to help Hashida--?!

78
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,750
A notebook listing all the clubs there?

79
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,750
I don't see anything like that.

80
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,750
The bookshelf?

81
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,833
The second shelf has--

82
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,167
Huh? Stay away from the second shelf?

83
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:16,792
Oh...

84
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,500
I'm seriously going to sue.

85
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:26,125
--What?
--It's me.

86
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,875
What's going on with the hacking?

87
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:33,292
You called it off, so it's been
at a standstill for three days now.

88
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,000
It's time you start explaining.

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,042
What exactly happened?

90
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:39,375
Mayuri... dies today.

91
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,917
You already told me.

92
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:44,042
That's why we're doing
the hacking, remember?

93
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:47,125
--Once we delete the first D-mail you--
--No!

94
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,042
No hacking.

95
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:53,083
I need to come up with a way
to save Mayuri without hacking.

96
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,708
Why?

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,125
Because something new has come up.

98
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,167
Like what?

99
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:04,042
I can't explain right now.

100
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:07,292
There <i>has </i>to be a way. Some other way...

101
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:08,875
What do you mean?

102
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,083
Please!

103
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,750
Explain to me.

104
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:18,292
I can't help you fix things
if you leave me in the dark.

105
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:25,208
It's soon, right? This is no time
to hide things from me, Okabe!

106
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,750
We're finally back!

107
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,500
Say, want to stop by the lab, Okarin?

108
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,833
Mayushii was thinking
of getting something to eat!

109
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:49,375
Are you all tired out, Okarin?

110
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,667
No...

111
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,125
It's almost time...

112
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:57,333
It's almost time for Mayuri to die again...

113
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,417
Should we run?

114
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:02,000
No, it'll still end like always...

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,375
Okarin?

116
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:04,792
Let's go.

117
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,958
Say, Okarin.

118
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,542
Why did you come with me today?

119
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:21,875
You hardly looked around at anything.

120
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:26,625
I could've shown you around more if
there was anything you wanted to see!

121
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:31,042
Mayushii usually doesn't
know more than you, you know?

122
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:35,917
Okarin...

123
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,500
Thanks for today!

124
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,958
This was our first time
going to Comima together!

125
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:50,000
Mayushii was glad!

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,708
Mayuri...

127
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:57,792
I had hoped to see Rukako acting
embarrassed in a cosplay outfit!

128
00:07:57,792 --> 00:07:59,458
It's a shame he didn't come!

129
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:03,167
Yeah! I'm sure he would've been really popular!

130
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:04,458
Definitely!

131
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:08,292
Then his pictures would get
posted on blogs everywhere

132
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:11,500
and he'd become a worldwide superstar!

133
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,667
And then Mayushii would see
that and think, "He's come so far!"

134
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:19,958
That almost sounds possible.

135
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,250
I think I'd love it even more
if <i>you </i>cosplay next, Okarin!

136
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,833
I'll think about it.

137
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:25,917
Really?

138
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:29,625
But only if <i>you </i>cosplay too, Mayuri.

139
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,208
Huh?

140
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:34,042
I know, let's invite Rukako and Christina.

141
00:08:34,042 --> 00:08:37,958
And then you can
convince them to cosplay too.

142
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:43,500
Only then will I, the mad
scientist Hououin Kyouma,

143
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,958
descend upon Comima as its star attraction!

144
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,875
Oh, we have a tough road ahead of us!

145
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,333
But Kurisu-<i>chan was </i>interested!

146
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,708
Mayushii will try hard to convince
them before the next Comima!

147
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,208
The next--

148
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,875
Huh?

149
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,125
Mayushii's watch has stopped...

150
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,000
That's strange. I wound it up--

151
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,458
Okarin?!

152
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,333
No! No more!

153
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,208
I've come so far! Why does it still...?!

154
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,250
Okarin?!

155
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,917
Just stay right here!

156
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:22,583
Okarin!

157
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,458
I <i>will </i>change it!

158
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,875
I'll change fate myself!

159
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,333
If I...

160
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,375
If I get run over here...!

161
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,125
If I let myself die...!

162
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,333
Something will <i>have </i>to change!

163
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,375
It'll have to!

164
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:40,167
Okarin!

165
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:48,750
Mayuri?!

166
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,000
Mayuri!

167
00:09:55,292 --> 00:09:58,708
Oka... rin...

168
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:03,500
I was finally... finally helpful...

169
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,167
Mayuri...

170
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:07,083
Mayushii...

171
00:10:08,292 --> 00:10:09,958
...was finally...

172
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,875
...helpful to you...

173
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:18,958
...Oka... rin...

174
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,083
Hey, Mayuri...

175
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:33,500
You can hardly see any stars from here...

176
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:39,917
This just isn't fair...

177
00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:03,750
I'm gonna run the hack now.

178
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,375
Okabe?

179
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,917
Okabe...?

180
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,042
How long are you gonna stay up here?

181
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,292
I told you I want to be alone.

182
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:39,417
You did.

183
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:43,417
But you've been on the roof
for hours, completely silent.

184
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:47,042
Of course I'd be worried-- I mean, I wouldn't.

185
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:52,333
Tell me. Why did you call off the hack?

186
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:55,375
You yourself said we shouldn't.

187
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:59,292
You're afraid the fuzz'll
get you, huh? That must be it!

188
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:02,500
Call it the awakening of a law-abiding citizen.

189
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,875
This isn't like you.

190
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:07,000
Where did your usual self-righteous attitude go?

191
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,625
--What kind of a mad scientist--
--This is no time for self-righteousness!

192
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:15,375
A mad scientist? Hououin Kyouma?!

193
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:18,667
That's all just nonsense! Make-believe!

194
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:20,958
Haven't you realized that?!

195
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,167
I knew from the moment I met you.

196
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,458
Don't tell me you've
done <i>another </i>time leap?!

197
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,917
What happened?

198
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:39,833
I've helped you so much already.
Don't hold back now.

199
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:44,417
Putting our heads together
is what's gotten you this far.

200
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:47,375
This far...

201
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,625
Suzuha, Faris, Rukako...

202
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:55,833
Sacrificing all their hopes and
dreams has finally led me here...

203
00:12:55,833 --> 00:13:00,250
And <i>this </i>is how it ends?

204
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,375
What do you mean?

205
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,125
Why...?

206
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,458
Okabe!

207
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,792
Listen, Okabe...

208
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:15,833
You were crying back there.

209
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,417
You had Hashida worried too.

210
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:22,500
He thought maybe you had
a bad dream or something.

211
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,125
Tell me.

212
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,292
I want to help you!

213
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:40,292
On July 28th...

214
00:13:40,292 --> 00:13:44,292
Mayuri and I went to Dr. Nakabachi's conference.

215
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:46,083
It was there...

216
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:52,375
It was there I found Makise Kurisu
on the ground, stabbed by someone.

217
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:56,208
I sent a message to Daru's phone, which
was connected to the Phone Microwave.

218
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,500
The very first D-mail...

219
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:04,083
It's what moved us from the beta
world line to this alpha world line...

220
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:07,500
Deleting that message
from SERN's database

221
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,250
and returning to the beta world line...

222
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,708
...means returning to <i>that </i>world.

223
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,792
If we return to the beta world line...

224
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:19,708
If we undo that D-mail...

225
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,208
...you'll die.

226
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,750
Answer it.

227
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:41,917
Answer it...

228
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:45,792
Mayuri?

229
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:46,833
Yeah.

230
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,375
What's up?

231
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:54,042
Well, Daru-<i>kun </i>said you
were acting strange, so...

232
00:14:54,042 --> 00:14:56,917
Nothing's wrong. He was mistaken.

233
00:14:56,917 --> 00:14:58,542
But...

234
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:01,875
I'm sorry.

235
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:07,083
Mayushii was so caught up in Comima
she didn't pay any attention to you.

236
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:11,542
Remember how you used
to tell me all sorts of things?

237
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:14,875
Like, let's see, the
Organization has four leaders...

238
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,667
Geppu, Sudachi, Seiyuu, and Jakko?

239
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,583
Genbu, Suzaku, Seiryuu, and Byakko.

240
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,042
Yeah, that's it.

241
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:27,375
All that stuff you'd tell me was really neat!

242
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:35,083
Anyway, tell me if I ever
feel like a burden to you, okay?

243
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,708
Well, I'm gonna go for now!

244
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:41,458
If there's anything you want
to talk about, just call, okay?

245
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,583
Mayuri! Wait!

246
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,750
You should go right now.

247
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,917
I could guess what she was
saying from the tone of your voice.

248
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:53,042
You should go to her right now.

249
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:56,875
Sitting here talking about me
won't solve anything right now.

250
00:15:56,875 --> 00:16:00,958
That's why you were
up here all alone, right?

251
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,917
So you should go see Mayuri.

252
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:08,792
Having you sit here and worry
about me will only hurt my pride.

253
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,667
I'm going now.

254
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:21,667
This is Mayushii!

255
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:24,375
I can't come to the phone right now.

256
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:28,958
It's me.

257
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,750
Yeah, some cosplayer
said she left a while ago.

258
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,583
I see.

259
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,500
I'm sorry.

260
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,000
You came to see me for
Obon, didn't you, Granny?

261
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:08,167
Actually, I've been having
these scary dreams lately.

262
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:13,417
Something terrible always
happens to Mayushii in them.

263
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:18,167
Like getting shot by pistols,
getting into car accidents,

264
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:20,500
and getting hit by trains...

265
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:27,625
It all feels so real and
scary and painful and sad...

266
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:34,583
I try really hard to
shout for help, but I can't...

267
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,208
I wonder why I have these dreams.

268
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:45,125
And then, at the end of them,
Okarin always comes to save me.

269
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:52,167
Mayushii tries to thank him,
but he can't hear her.

270
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:59,375
He holds Mayushii tight
and looks really sad.

271
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:04,708
He never cries, but I can tell
he's fighting hard to hold back.

272
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:11,292
So Mayushii tries to say she's
sorry, but he can't hear her...

273
00:18:11,292 --> 00:18:12,833
And then I wake up.

274
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,542
Sorry, I'll talk about something nice now!

275
00:18:18,542 --> 00:18:21,500
We've gained a lot of lab members lately!

276
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:27,833
There's Kurisu-<i>chan</i>, Moeka-<i>san,</i>
Ruka-<i>kun</i>, Faris-<i>chan</i>, and Suzu-<i>san.</i>

277
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:31,333
I remember when we started
out with only two members!

278
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:34,542
Kurisu-<i>chan </i>is <i>really </i>smart

279
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:37,750
and talks about tons of
complicated stuff with Okarin.

280
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,833
It's so nice and lively!

281
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:43,417
And Okarin seems happy,
being able to talk so much.

282
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:49,375
But, you know, sometimes I think back...

283
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:54,750
...to when Mayushii first visited the lab.

284
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:59,125
It was snowing, even
though it was early spring...

285
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:04,375
I went to the lab after school,
but Okarin wasn't there.

286
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:09,250
And then, while I was
tidying up the place, he arrived.

287
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:14,458
I said, "Welcome back!"
but he didn't say, "I'm back!"

288
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:17,667
Instead, he replied with, "Good work!"

289
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:20,333
After that, I spent about
two hours there every day,

290
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,125
even though we barely ever talked.

291
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:29,750
But it wasn't a bad silence.
We were just "there."

292
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:35,083
Slowly and gently, time would pass...

293
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:39,167
Mayushii almost felt like she <i>was </i>a hostage!

294
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:42,583
Did something good happen?

295
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:43,667
Mm-hmm!

296
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:47,042
Yes... but no!

297
00:19:47,042 --> 00:19:49,625
Oh? Sounds like you were hallucinating then.

298
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:54,542
It could be the work of the Illusion
Conductor, a top Organization leader.

299
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:58,167
Really?! Then I better be careful!

300
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:01,333
--But I don't think this Illusion Condor--
--Conductor.

301
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,792
Oh, right.

302
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:07,042
I don't think he's actually a bad guy!

303
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:14,667
Okarin and I don't talk as much anymore.

304
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:20,042
I used to be able to tell what he was
thinking just from seeing his face...

305
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:23,792
But lately I can't tell at all.

306
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:27,667
All I <i>can </i>tell is that he's in pain...

307
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:29,708
That he's suffering...

308
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,583
He always looks ready to cry...

309
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:36,417
And I know it's because of Mayushii...

310
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:42,292
I don't mean to be a burden to him, though.

311
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm sorry! I started
talking about sad stuff again!

312
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,250
I guess maybe Mayushii's feeling lonely.

313
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,292
Granny...

314
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:56,833
I can't stay like this forever, can I?

315
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:00,500
You can.

316
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,625
O--

317
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,250
Okarin!

318
00:21:11,042 --> 00:21:12,958
How did you know where to find me?

319
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:17,625
I <i>always </i>know where my hostage is.

320
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,375
You will never escape my clutches.

321
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,000
Never.

322
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,583
Don't push yourself too hard, okay?

323
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:33,625
Hououin Kyouma is not so weak
that he needs you to worry about him.

324
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,375
I'll tell you everything...

325
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,250
...when the time comes.

326
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,417
Okay.

327
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:44,250
--Let's go.
--Oh, but first--!

328
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,792
I know.

329
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:48,625
You want to get another Oopa, don't you?

330
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:35,167
<i>With my vision restricted, there's no escape</i>

331
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:43,917
<i>from the merciless control of the twelve</i>

332
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:52,792
<i>Wishing for a tomorrow of repose,</i>

333
00:22:52,792 --> 00:23:01,500
<i>I embark for the horizon of the</i>
<i>sacred phenomenon in my hand</i>

334
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:10,125
<i>Trapped by the covenant and</i>
<i>shown the outline of false evidence</i>

335
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:19,250
<i>the heaven and earth of</i>
<i>life lets time blindly flow by</i>

336
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:28,125
<i>Flutter, butterfly, oh, miraculous</i>
<i>butterfly! I give myself to you</i>

337
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:35,292
<i>Oh, butterfly of tears,</i>
<i>dazzling butterfly! It's all...</i>

338
00:23:35,292 --> 00:24:02,027
<i>...about to be rewritten now</i>
