1
00:00:07,917 --> 00:00:09,875
Is this...?

2
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:11,083
A time machine.

3
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:14,375
I'm from the year 2036.

4
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:16,500
Suzuha...

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,500
I'm the time traveler...

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,292
...John Titor.

7
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:41,875
<i>For you, billions and billions of heartbeats</i>

8
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:48,542
<i>are nothing at all; just the blink of an eye</i>

9
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:53,750
<i>Although I'm trapped by</i>
<i>the past and lament the future</i>

10
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:59,667
<i>inevitability won't allow for</i>
<i>even a speck of a miscalculation</i>

11
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:05,792
<i>Our dreams and futures that</i>
<i>form and expand into "infinity"</i>

12
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:11,667
<i>allow us the right to be vain,</i>

13
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:17,875
<i>while the two hands</i>
<i>point out what is "finite"</i>

14
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:22,458
<i>All of which leads to a cruel</i>
<i>contract and choice to make</i>

15
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,708
<i>Hacking to the Gate</i>

16
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:31,625
<i>So, now, with each passing</i>
<i>second, I'll cross world lines</i>

17
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:36,542
<i>to protect that smile on your face</i>

18
00:01:36,542 --> 00:01:43,542
<i>Then, once again, into a</i>
<i>time loop without sadness</i>

19
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:50,208
<i>I will be swallowed up as a lone observer</i>

20
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:04,875
In the year 2036, SERN ruled the world.

21
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,917
They had complete control
of everything; it was a dystopia.

22
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:13,083
The people, stripped of their freedom,
lived as if they were already dead.

23
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:16,000
And anyone who stood up
in opposition was slaughtered.

24
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:28,542
I was a member of the resistance
that fought to free humanity from SERN.

25
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:54,583
I boarded a time machine my dad left me...

26
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:59,167
...to change this dying world.

27
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,875
And to alter the future.

28
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,667
Then all those posts on @channel were...?!

29
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,958
Yeah. Most of them are true.

30
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:35,708
But SERN's a research
organization, not a governing body.

31
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:39,583
I pointed that out to
John Titor many times online!

32
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,583
Hold on, does that mean
<i>you're </i>the one who posted

33
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,542
under the name
"Chestnut Rice and Kamehame-ha"?!

34
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:51,167
The person playing Titor has revealed
herself, so it's only fair that I do too.

35
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:53,458
Then I'll follow suit.

36
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,208
I posted under the
pseudonym "Hououin Kyouma"--

37
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,375
We know.

38
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:03,167
SERN succeeded in developing a time machine.

39
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:08,167
Being the only ones capable of
meddling with the 4th dimension of time,

40
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,750
they were able to reshape the world order.

41
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:16,542
And Makise Kurisu contributed the
most in developing SERN's time machine.

42
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:19,333
She was revered as the
mother of time machines.

43
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,750
Me, help SERN?! That's nonsense!

44
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,208
Why would I help creeps
who use people as guinea pigs?!

45
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:29,333
Well, you did, in the future.

46
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:32,833
Is that why you were always
antagonistic toward me?

47
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:40,458
What about <i>my </i>future self, then?

48
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,375
Okabe Rintaro was a famous terrorist.

49
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,292
A terrorist?!

50
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:47,583
An anti-SERN terrorist.

51
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,333
And...

52
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:55,292
In 2036, you're both dead.

53
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,708
--Well, I got to go.
--Wait!

54
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:05,125
You're just gonna say that
and then return to the future?!

55
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:09,000
No, I'm going to the past,
to change the future.

56
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,625
Back to the year 1975.

57
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,417
1975?

58
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:16,458
SERN succeeded in
developing a time machine

59
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:20,875
because of the one built in Akihabara in 2010.

60
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,833
--You mean the Phone Microwave?
--Yeah.

61
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,833
SERN used a global monitoring system

62
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:31,458
to gather any and all information
regarding time machines.

63
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,958
And, Okabe Rintaro,

64
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:38,083
I think the first D-mail
you sent set off their system.

65
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,125
The one I sent in front
of the Radio Building...?

66
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:47,125
Yes. So if we can just delete
that e-mail from SERN's database...

67
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:50,417
...the future will change.

68
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,417
We'll move to a beta world line

69
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:56,500
where SERN never
completed its time machine!

70
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,250
Will that save Mayuri too?!

71
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,333
Probably.

72
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,208
Then let's hack SERN's
database right away and--!

73
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:07,458
We need an IBN 5100 for that.

74
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,292
Oh! So that's why--!

75
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:15,000
My mission is to go to 1975,
obtain an IBN 5100,

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,250
and get it into Okabe Rintaro's hands.

77
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,875
But I've wasted too much time in
this time period looking for my dad.

78
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,167
I should've gone sooner.

79
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:28,875
Is everything okay?!

80
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,250
Oh, no!

81
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,292
It's broken...

82
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:40,500
--Not good!
--What now?!

83
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,125
I'll figure something out! You two
hide and get away when you can!

84
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,000
Someone in here?

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,792
--Who are you?!
--Stay back!

86
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:53,542
I'm currently on an assignment
to thwart an Organization plot!

87
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:56,833
This is a Level 17 top-secret mission!

88
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,167
Now leave at once!

89
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:00,250
Catch me if you can!

90
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,583
--Hey!
--Get back here!

91
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,333
Let's make a run for it!

92
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:12,875
Hurry!

93
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,667
I don't know what happened in the future,

94
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:17,917
but right now we're fellow lab members!

95
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,083
Okabe!

96
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,375
You made it out?!

97
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,042
Let's scram!

98
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,500
Now what do we do?
We can't go back there again...

99
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:53,458
--So the time machine broke?
--After it crashed into the roof?

100
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:56,167
It didn't "crash."

101
00:07:56,167 --> 00:08:00,750
I miscalculated the coordinates,
and that's just where it materialized.

102
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,250
But it wasn't broken when I arrived.

103
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,292
Then when...?!

104
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:08,792
The only possibility I can think of
is that thunderstorm the other day.

105
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:15,708
It was either the
lightning or all that rainwater...

106
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,208
It's my fault.

107
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:21,542
It's because I stopped you that night...

108
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,333
But I can use the time leap machine!

109
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:27,708
It can only go back 48 hours at most, though.

110
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,583
That makes it out of reach...

111
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,375
Oh, Okarin!

112
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,000
And Kurisu-<i>chan </i>and Suzu-<i>san</i>!

113
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,333
I thought you guys went home?!

114
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,542
Mayushii said we should
celebrate its completion after all.

115
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:42,250
So Daru-<i>kun </i>and I picked up some things!

116
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,500
I told you to leave for today!

117
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,958
I'm sorry, Mayuri.

118
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,750
We have important things to discuss now.

119
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,917
Okarin?

120
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:53,750
Just go home for today.

121
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:58,042
We'll still celebrate, just some other time.

122
00:08:58,042 --> 00:08:59,708
Okay.

123
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,875
But don't do anything dangerous, okay?

124
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,042
Mayushii worries about you.

125
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:07,792
We'll be okay. I promise.

126
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,208
See you tomorrow!

127
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,833
Yeah.

128
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:23,333
--I hear they stopped the trains.
--You serious?

129
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,917
Our only choice is to repair the time machine.

130
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,750
First, you'll jump to five hours ago--

131
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,583
when the time leap machine
is finished, in other words.

132
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:52,500
Then you'll jump another
48 hours back, to 2:00 pm on the 11th.

133
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,750
I guess that's all the
time we have to work with.

134
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,250
I'll do whatever it takes to fix the
time machine within those two days.

135
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,125
If it doesn't work out, then
I'll just keep redoing those two days!

136
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,333
This isn't about saving the world.

137
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,375
It's about saving Mayuri!

138
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,625
Okabe?

139
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,625
What's the matter?

140
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,375
Get all the lab members here right away.

141
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,625
I have something to tell you.

142
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:42,125
Sweet! Future people FTW!

143
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,750
Can you fix it?

144
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,292
You can't fix it yourself, Miss Amane?

145
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:48,542
I have no idea how it works.

146
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:50,750
My dad's the one who made it.

147
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,625
We can't possibly fix a time
machine from 2036 with current tech--

148
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,625
We won't know unless we try!

149
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,292
Just figure something
out within two days, Daru!

150
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:02,500
--You're our only hope!
--Why two days?

151
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,250
Well, uhh...

152
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,917
Just do it in two days!

153
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,708
If you can fix it in two days,
I'll do whatever you ask!

154
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:10,708
Deal!

155
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,083
I want to go on an
all-day date with Faris-<i>tan</i>!

156
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,708
All right. I'll make it happen somehow.

157
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,458
--No, there's no way.
--There's nothing I can't do!

158
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,083
Trust me!

159
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,333
Serious? You swear?

160
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,167
I promise! Just get it done!

161
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:29,792
Very well!

162
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,833
One more thing?

163
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:37,500
If I fix it, bring us back the IBN 5100

164
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,167
<i>and </i>an animation cel from the
legendary 1975 magical series,

165
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,167
"Radical Girl Omit-<i>chan</i>"!

166
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:44,917
Have some self-respect!

167
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:46,500
Shall I help too?

168
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:52,333
No, you have the important task
of completing the time leap machine.

169
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,792
--You should probably get back to the--
--Hey, everyone!

170
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:57,125
Is it me, or are you forgetting something?

171
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,167
What about finding Suzu-<i>san</i>'s dad?

172
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:01,750
--My dad doesn't matter anymore--
--Don't say that!

173
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:06,000
I know you used the machine
because you have a mission and stuff,

174
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,167
but you also did it to see your dad, right?

175
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:12,792
So Mayushii wants you two to meet!

176
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,750
Your father's name was Barrel Titor, right?

177
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,667
That's his code name.
I don't know his real one.

178
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:22,542
--What about "Amane"?
--I got it from my mom.

179
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:27,625
My only clue is this one memento:
a badge my dad used to have.

180
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,958
You're dad's in Akihabara in 2010, right?

181
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:39,083
In that case, Mayushii will
begin investigating at once!

182
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,917
Shiina Mayuri is a nice girl, huh?

183
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,208
Think you can fix it?

184
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:02,250
I'm not 100% sure yet, but
after giving it a quick look-over

185
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,500
I noticed it's actually kinda
like the Phone Microwave...

186
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,417
Then you might be able to fix it?!

187
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:11,083
Yeah.

188
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,833
You know, I wonder if your
dad's someone close to us.

189
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:20,708
After all, you knew <i>we</i>
were in Akiba in 2010...

190
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:24,292
Probably. He didn't tell me himself, so...

191
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:31,208
I've never actually met my dad;
it was all written in his will.

192
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:35,833
He was doing his own time
machine research separate from SERN,

193
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,208
to try to change the future.

194
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,875
And now I'm here to carry out his wish.

195
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,250
I'm seriously sorry.

196
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,750
But I'm sure everything will
work out after I fix the time machine!

197
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:56,250
I'll keep looking for your dad
until you come back from 1975!

198
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:01,083
So keep it a secret from Okarin
and snag me a legendary "Radical--"

199
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:10,125
This is such tedious work.

200
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,583
For a so-called Future Gadget Laboratory,

201
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,042
you'd think we'd have a
more futuristic way to do this.

202
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:18,000
If only it were that convenient.

203
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,208
Future Gadget #2,
Alternative Edition, Version 2.67.

204
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,458
Known as the "Bamboo-copter Camera."

205
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,917
It has a CCD camera installed in the bottom.

206
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,958
That's actually a decent idea!

207
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,000
Couldn't we conduct an aerial search--

208
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,250
The camera spins with it, so the
footage it takes spins rapidly too.

209
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,667
That hasn't been fixed, even by Version 2.67?

210
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:50,375
That's the prototype.

211
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:56,250
Daru gave it the name and version
number for fun. There's no meaning to it.

212
00:14:58,292 --> 00:15:01,333
--Where's Daru?
--Still there, working on it.

213
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,917
The Divergence Meter...

214
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:25,542
I thought you should have this.
You created it, after all.

215
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:30,125
The future will change
if this number passes 1%.

216
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,167
And since you're the only one
with the Reading Steiner ability,

217
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,417
only you can perceive
how the number changes.

218
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:39,417
Did my future self give that
to you just before he died?

219
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:43,417
No. I've never met him.

220
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:48,833
You were a founder of the
resistance group I'm a member of.

221
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,917
A founder of a resistance group...

222
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,042
That's pathetic.

223
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:55,792
Not only do I let Mayuri die,

224
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:59,625
I go on to live a carefree life
<i>and </i>do something so delusional...?!

225
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,417
It's <i>not </i>pathetic!

226
00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:06,833
Liberating the world is a
brave and admirable ambition!

227
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,375
Uhh...

228
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,000
Hey, mister!

229
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,625
I am mad scientist!

230
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,375
So cool!

231
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,000
Sunovabitch.

232
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,042
Yes, can I help you?

233
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:54,792
Oh, you know Japanese...

234
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:56,917
I got a question for you.

235
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:58,917
Do you recognize this?

236
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:02,667
I wanna know where
it's from. Can you find out?

237
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:05,375
Oh, remembering is...

238
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,333
Sorry. No can help.

239
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,833
Actually, I'm not so
sure about his Japanese...

240
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:16,333
If you remember anything, contact me here.

241
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:27,333
Maybe it doesn't exist yet because
it's made sometime in the near future?

242
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:31,917
I guess maybe I'm just
not destined to meet my dad.

243
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,458
--Let's call it quits.
--You're just gonna give up?!

244
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,958
We still have a day left, you know!

245
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,708
--Why are <i>you </i>upset--
--More than anything...

246
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,083
...I want to make saving Mayuri my main focus!

247
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,875
Even so, you're a fellow
lab member and a friend!

248
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,333
You're a friend in need, so I want to help!

249
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,875
But you can't just give
up at the drop of a hat!

250
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,542
D-Don't yell at me.

251
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,000
Sorry.

252
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,292
--Please, I need your help! Please!
--What is she...?

253
00:18:02,292 --> 00:18:05,208
There was a kidnapping yesterday!

254
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,125
I'm looking for the kidnapper!
He was wearing this badge!

255
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:11,917
I would appreciate your help!

256
00:18:11,917 --> 00:18:13,875
Oh! Okarin!

257
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,500
Look! Look!

258
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,917
Mayuri...

259
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:23,708
Good plan, huh?

260
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,167
It was Mayushii's idea!

261
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:30,292
I thought it might
make everyone go, "Oh!"

262
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:33,375
The plan's name is "Mayushii
Pamphlets Her Way to Victory!"

263
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,458
Don't you think saying there was
a kidnapping is going a little far...?

264
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:39,917
What happens when
the police take notice of--?

265
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:42,000
--Oh, no! Let's get outta here!
--Huh? What for?

266
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,292
You, there!

267
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:44,708
Hey, wait!

268
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,417
I'm sorry...

269
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:57,292
From now on, run all plans--
<i>and </i>plan names--by me first...

270
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:03,958
What are you doing?

271
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,625
Oh, it's just you, Christina.

272
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,958
This is good timing. I just
found out something terrible.

273
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,792
What?

274
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:17,375
When I went to buy lunch,
I overheard the shop clerks talking.

275
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,917
I think your father might
be a kidnapper, Amane-<i>san</i>...

276
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:30,417
Wh-What? What's going on?

277
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,875
How's it going?

278
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,125
For you.

279
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:45,958
WTF, dude. This work clearly
calls for ice-cold, no-calorie cola.

280
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,042
Well? Do you think you can repair it?

281
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:49,708
Should have it done by tomorrow.

282
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,292
Wow! I know it's a rush job, but wow!

283
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,458
Daru's got serious skills, all right.

284
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,667
He seems so unhealthy and
drab on the outside, though.

285
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:59,458
Don't judge a book by its cover.

286
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,583
Right! I've changed my opinion of him!

287
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,917
Then you can help me too, Miss Amane.

288
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:06,917
And, inside the cramped time machine,
the sweltering heat will be so much

289
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:10,042
that we'll forget our
embarrassment and strip our clothes...

290
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,750
Have some self-respect, pervert!

291
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:16,417
--Daru-<i>kun </i>and Suzu-<i>san </i>sure make a good match!
--Huh?! A good match?!

292
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:17,667
In what way?!

293
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:21,583
I can't quite put my
finger on it, but they just do.

294
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,458
--What's going on?
--Oh, nothing.

295
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,708
Mayuri's just being weird.

296
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,708
Still, I'll be really worried about you

297
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,417
after the time machine
is fixed and you leave in it!

298
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:33,792
I'd go with you, if only
it could carry two people.

299
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:35,625
What help would <i>you </i>be?

300
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,208
Isn't it obvious?!

301
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:41,125
I'd hold Suzu-<i>san</i>'s hand real
tight and support her by saying,

302
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:45,542
"Don't worry! You'll be fine!
Mayushii's here for you!"

303
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,708
Listen, I feel like I might never
get another chance to say this,

304
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,875
so I'll just say it now...

305
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,542
Oh? That sounds a little over-the-top.

306
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:04,333
I'm really grateful to you all.

307
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:08,708
When I first came to this
time period, I didn't know anyone,

308
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,792
and even though this
era's so much more peaceful,

309
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:16,333
I found it really frightening.

310
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:20,375
But now I have so many friends.

311
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:27,542
I really had a lot of fun, coming to
this era and spending time with you.

312
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:31,292
Even if it was for a short time, I'm
glad to have been a fellow lab member.

313
00:21:31,292 --> 00:21:36,333
I'm glad... I could be with you guys.

314
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,333
Suzuha...

315
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,042
Okabe Rintaro!

316
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:41,833
Promise you'll change the future, okay?

317
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:45,208
Make it a free world, like it is now!

318
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,042
Suzuha...

319
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,333
Yes?

320
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:54,625
Hello? Mad scientist so cool?

321
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,375
The street vendor from this afternoon?

322
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,375
I just remembered.

323
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,667
Yesterday night. A man with that badge.

324
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:03,083
You found her father?!

325
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,250
Hang on! I'll be right there!

326
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:35,167
<i>With my vision restricted, there's no escape</i>

327
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:43,917
<i>from the merciless control of the twelve</i>

328
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:52,792
<i>Wishing for a tomorrow of repose,</i>

329
00:22:52,792 --> 00:23:01,500
<i>I embark for the horizon of the</i>
<i>sacred phenomenon in my hand</i>

330
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:10,125
<i>Trapped by the covenant and</i>
<i>shown the outline of false evidence</i>

331
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:19,250
<i>the heaven and earth of</i>
<i>life lets time blindly flow by</i>

332
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:28,125
<i>Flutter, butterfly, oh, miraculous</i>
<i>butterfly! I give myself to you</i>

333
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:35,292
<i>Oh, butterfly of tears,</i>
<i>dazzling butterfly! It's all...</i>

334
00:23:35,292 --> 00:24:02,070
<i>...about to be rewritten now</i>
