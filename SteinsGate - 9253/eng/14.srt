1
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:15,750
After that, I time-leapt over and over...

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,125
...to try to save Mayuri.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,625
But...

4
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,917
...no matter how hard I tried...

5
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:33,083
...Mayuri kept dying.

6
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:52,292
Even without Moeka's thugs attacking,

7
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:54,500
it was as if fate itself was killing her...

8
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:59,500
It was like the whole world...

9
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:04,042
...was conspiring to kill Mayuri.

10
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,833
We haven't moved an inch!

11
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:12,833
'Cause the trains have stopped.

12
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:15,375
Please hurry! A back
alley or anything will do!

13
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,333
There's not much I can do...

14
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:22,292
Huh? Mayushii's watch has stopped...

15
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:23,833
That's strange.

16
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,458
--I wound it up just a little while ago...

17
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:26,583
--Not again...
--I wound it up just a little while ago...

18
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,125
Not again!

19
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,375
Mayuri!

20
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,250
The deceased is Shiina Mayuri.

21
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:50,500
Okabe-<i>kun</i>-- I mean,
Okabe Rintaro has fled.

22
00:01:56,167 --> 00:02:03,417
No matter what I do or
what I try, she keeps dying.

23
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:07,000
It's almost like this is fate!

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,958
I see. This must be--

25
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,125
No, there's no such thing!

26
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:19,542
The Organization, Steins Gate,
choices made by destiny...!

27
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,958
None of it...

28
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,417
...is real!

43
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,208
Explain!

44
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:06,958
I just hit a story branch!
At least let me save!

45
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:10,958
I'll do it for you!
Just get out of Akihabara!

46
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,833
--Got it?!
--Okabe?!

47
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:44,167
Mayuri's already left...

48
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,208
It's the same...

49
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:52,542
However hard I try to help
Mayuri escape, it's always...

50
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:56,958
Even the e-mails are the same.

51
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,292
E-mail...?

52
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,500
"Shining Finger.

53
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,875
I have new info about the time machine.

54
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,792
I want to talk with you, alone."

55
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,500
Don't move.

56
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,417
Hands up.

57
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,708
Just who are you people?!

58
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:44,750
I work part-time at Arc Rewrite.

59
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:51,000
I know you're going to raid our
lab tonight and try to abduct us!

60
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:55,042
--How?
--Because I came from the future!

61
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:58,250
Understand?! Now answer me!

62
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,125
--I'd prefer e-mail--
--No! Answer me now!

63
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,708
Are you guys with SERN?!

64
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:03,750
We're Rounders.

65
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,917
"Rounders"?!

66
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:08,167
Our mission is to retrieve the IBN 5100.

67
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,500
--Are<i> you </i>the one who stole it?!
--I don't know what you mean.

68
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,625
Don't play dumb!

69
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,667
That D-mail of yours was what--!

70
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:16,875
Oh, right.

71
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:22,583
When the world line changed, Moeka
lost all memory of sending that D-mail.

72
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:27,542
Why attack the lab, then?!
The IBN 5100 isn't there anymore!

73
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:29,583
--I can't--
--Answer me!

74
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,125
Three reasons.

75
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:37,083
One: you've learned
things you shouldn't have.

76
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:42,833
Two: you created a time machine.

77
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:49,875
Three: you tried to go public with it.

78
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:54,792
You knew that much...?

79
00:06:54,792 --> 00:06:57,375
SERN knows that much?!

80
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,292
I receive my orders from FB.

81
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:02,833
"FB"?

82
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:06,625
A group inside SERN--?!

83
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:11,625
FB is... my all.

84
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:16,292
Where am I...?

85
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:18,375
Don't move.

86
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:21,542
Are <i>you </i>John Titor?

87
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:26,375
You're the only
possibility I can think of...

88
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,000
No!

89
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:37,958
This is...

90
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:43,708
The bomb threat stopped
all the trains, just as planned.

91
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:49,000
Secure Makise Kurisu and Hashida Itaru.

92
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,417
All others are expendable.

93
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:51,583
Wait--!

94
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,250
W-Wait!

95
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:00,750
I beg you! Don't kill... Don't kill Mayuri!

96
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,333
I apologize!

97
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,458
I was in the wrong!

98
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,500
I wasn't trying to expose SERN or anything!

99
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,417
I'll give you the time leap machine!

100
00:08:09,417 --> 00:08:11,417
I won't tell <i>anyone </i>about this!

101
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:13,417
Commence operation.

102
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:15,417
Please! I'll do anything!

103
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:18,417
Please! I just let my
curiosity get the better of me!

104
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:20,375
I was just playing around!

105
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:24,167
Please, just don't kill Mayuri...!

106
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:26,750
It's too late.

107
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,000
Mayuri...!

108
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,833
Mayuri!

109
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,917
Shut up!

110
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:40,625
Mayuri!

111
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,125
Mayuri...

112
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:07,167
What's with you?

113
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,792
Did you doze off or something?

114
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:13,042
--That again?
--Huh?

115
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,083
I...

116
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,750
--...can't take it anymore!
--Okabe!

117
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,667
WTF...?

118
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,458
You don't have to break it!

119
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:30,792
You decided not to do
the time leap, remember?

120
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:32,500
What brought that on?

121
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,833
We're going shopping, right? For the party...

122
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,542
The party is...

123
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:41,875
Hey! Okabe!

124
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,625
Clackety-clack!

125
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,917
Bullet train!

126
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:49,833
No, honey, bullet trains are white.

127
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,792
Oh, Okab-- I mean, Kyouma-<i>san</i>!

128
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,917
Where's Mayuri?

129
00:09:58,917 --> 00:10:00,917
Oh, Mayuri-<i>chan </i>left earlier...

130
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:02,625
--I know.
--Huh?!

131
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,625
I also know she came
to invite you to the party,

132
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:11,042
that she's visiting her cosplayer
friend on her way back to the lab...!

133
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:14,125
And that she's looking forward to the party!

134
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:17,458
I know it all!

135
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:25,208
I'm sorry...

136
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,792
Yet...

137
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:29,875
Yet, I'm...

138
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,292
What are you doing there?

139
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,417
Kurisu...

140
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:45,042
Oh, you used my actual name for once.

141
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:49,333
What happened? No, what happens?

142
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:55,250
You time-leapt here, didn't you?

143
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,167
It's all... because of me.

144
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:00,667
Okabe...

145
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,875
It's all because of me...!

146
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:07,333
I should never have asked
Daru to hack into them...!

147
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,583
I should never have suggested
making a time machine...!

148
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,292
I should never have
made Moeka a lab member!

149
00:11:13,292 --> 00:11:17,042
It's my fault that Mayuri gets...

150
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,625
You dummy. You couldn't
be any more reckless...

151
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:29,750
There's no guarantee that the
time leap machine is safe to use.

152
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,917
For all we know, it could even
make you cease to exist altogether!

153
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:38,083
Humans are essentially temporal beings.

154
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:42,625
Heidegger. I was just
about to say that myself.

155
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:46,125
You taught me that quote.

156
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:50,500
That's kind of creepy. It's like
you're peering into my brain.

157
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,708
But maybe that's just how time-leaping is.

158
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,792
What should I do?

159
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:00,375
When does the lab get attacked?

160
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,750
After 7:30.

161
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,833
I can think of several
possibilities why Mayuri keeps dying.

162
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:11,667
But there's no time to discuss that.

163
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,167
Let's go.

164
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:17,542
I consider Mayuri a close friend.
I want to save her too!

165
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:21,958
--Sorry to drag you into this...
--Don't apologize.

166
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,125
I want to help.

167
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,292
I'll be...

168
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:29,625
Come on, mad scientist!

169
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:33,042
You're bent on reshaping the world's
power structure or whatever, right?

170
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,792
"But of course!"

171
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,667
...Right?

172
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:02,083
I've set it to about five hours ago,

173
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:06,417
around the time the time
leap machine is finished.

174
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:11,000
Any earlier and you risk the chance
of the machine not being completed.

175
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:19,458
You'll leap there, and once it's
completed, you'll have everyone leave

176
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,750
and then re-tell me what you told me earlier.

177
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,833
If you tell me you came from
the future, I'll probably believe you.

178
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,583
How can you be sure?

179
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,708
I know myself the most.

180
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:35,042
Besides, I was the one who developed
the time leap machine in the first place!

181
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,458
Meaning you're confident
of your own machine?

182
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:42,708
I guess. I was convinced when
I saw the way you acted earlier, too.

183
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:46,042
I realized you'd time-leapt.

184
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:49,625
Shall we decide on a
pass phrase just to be safe?

185
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:54,208
"What I most want right
now is my own personal fork."

186
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,208
You do? Your own personal fork?

187
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:00,083
Yep. I already have my
own personal spoon, so...

188
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:03,375
Wait, don't take an interest in that!

189
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,667
Just get ready!

190
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:07,292
Okay.

191
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,625
I guess the version of me five hours ago

192
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:16,500
won't know you called
me "Kurisu," will she?

193
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:29,167
Think you could hold this for me?

194
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:31,125
--Like this?
--Yes, just like that!

195
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:35,083
Hold it nice and wide!

196
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,000
Oh, that's a cute ribbon!

197
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,792
Isn't it, though?

198
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:44,708
Do you want to try it on? I have
plenty of other costumes for Comima!

199
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,542
Cosplay, huh...

200
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:48,667
Oh, are you interested?

201
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:51,208
O-Of course not!

202
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,917
I couldn't dress like that in public...

203
00:14:55,333 --> 00:15:00,458
Ah. Five hours earlier
places it before Mayuri leaves.

204
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:04,750
As I recall, the time leap machine is
finished just as Mayuri's costume is.

205
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:06,917
It's done!

206
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:08,000
Tadah!

207
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,875
Mayushii wins!

208
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,375
--We were racing!
--You got us.

209
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,000
But we're done too.

210
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,708
It's finished now.

211
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:19,333
This is--

212
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,167
We won't do the experiment!

213
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:22,792
Huh?

214
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,958
Crap, was that too sudden?!

215
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,417
What do you mean?

216
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:32,333
I-I figure you're all exhausted, so...

217
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:36,458
I'll explain later; you're
all dismissed for today!

218
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:41,333
--One beef bowl.
--One bowl, coming up.

219
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,000
Why here?

220
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,125
I got your e-mail just after I ordered.

221
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,708
I never imagined <i>you'd </i>be a regular here...

222
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:53,083
I-I'm not a regular.
Mayuri told me about this place.

223
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,625
So, what is it you need to tell me?

224
00:15:55,625 --> 00:16:00,417
First you tell me to leave,
and then you e-mail me...

225
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,708
The truth is...

226
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:06,292
...I'm from five hours in the future!

227
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:09,375
Huh? What kind of lame line is that?

228
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:13,333
H-Hey! That's not what you said you'd say!

229
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,625
"I'll probably believe you," my butt!

230
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,792
What nonsense is this now?

231
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:22,625
I'd never use such specious
words as "probably" or "believe."

232
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,083
But you did!

233
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,792
You said, "I'm the one who made the
time leap machine in the first place!"

234
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:29,542
All smug-like!

235
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:30,833
Are you crazy?

236
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,500
I can't help but ROFL.

237
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:37,167
Oh, how I wish I could slug her...

238
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,750
"What you most want right
now is your own personal fork!"

239
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,750
Well?

240
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:50,083
I really said that five hours from now?!

241
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,208
You also said, "I already have
my own personal spoon, so..."

242
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,375
Curse you, five-hours-from-now me...!

243
00:16:56,375 --> 00:17:00,167
Now do you believe me?

244
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:01,958
Yes...

245
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,708
So the machine...

246
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,625
...really <i>does </i>work?

247
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,292
Here's your beef bowl!

248
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:16,208
I see. If this is all true, then
this is a pretty serious situation.

249
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,167
Yeah.

250
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,625
Rather than help Mayuri escape,

251
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,792
what about Moeka-<i>san</i>
and her... Rounders, were they?

252
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:24,333
Could you try stopping them instead?

253
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,167
I tried.

254
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:29,875
But I still wasn't able to
prevent Mayuri's death...

255
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,500
Oh.

256
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:38,667
Things always occur due to the
existence of an underlying cause.

257
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:45,833
Death can normally be attributed
to a directly-related event

258
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:49,083
such as an illness or an accident,

259
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,042
but they aren't necessarily the cause itself.

260
00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:56,000
The Rounders are directly
driving Mayuri to her death,

261
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,583
but the real underlying
cause is probably something else.

262
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:02,500
That's why she continues to
die even without their involvement.

263
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,542
Then what <i>is </i>the cause?

264
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,000
I don't know.

265
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,208
Who knows, it could be that Mayuri's birth

266
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:12,625
is the cause that results in her own death.

267
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,167
You're referring to her lifespan?

268
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,042
That's fatalism, then!

269
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:20,042
Yes. So I don't support that hypothesis.

270
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:24,583
The cause <i>must </i>be something that
acted as the trigger for <i>these </i>events.

271
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,417
The trigger...

272
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,042
Do you think if this never
gets finished, she could--?!

273
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:36,708
Wait. It's dangerous to jump to conclusions.

274
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:37,958
But...

275
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:41,000
Makise Kurisu is right.

276
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,250
Do you know something?

277
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,417
Your theory is mostly right.

278
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:52,417
It's true that it'll be tough to solve
this without the time leap machine.

279
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:56,667
To save the world, you need to overcome

280
00:18:56,667 --> 00:19:01,667
the 1% divergence barrier
and reach the "beta world line."

281
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:07,917
The "divergence number"
indicates this world line's location.

282
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:14,125
And this Divergence Meter is our
only indication of what that number is.

283
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:17,542
Nixie tubes... Whoever
made this has good taste.

284
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:21,792
Well, of course. You're the one who built it.

285
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:22,708
Me?!

286
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:28,583
You have the ability to retain
your memories across world lines.

287
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:32,625
Your future self used that to
create a gauge that numerically shows

288
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:37,250
how different the current
world line is from the previous one.

289
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,458
0.337187...

290
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,750
That's <i>this </i>world line.

291
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:48,125
World lines are a lot like yarn or this rope.

292
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:54,042
At first glance, this looks
like a single piece of rope,

293
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:58,417
but it actually consists of
a bunch of smaller threads.

294
00:19:58,417 --> 00:20:00,625
These threads are world lines.

295
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:07,042
They're all independent of each other,
but they all lead to the same end.

296
00:20:07,042 --> 00:20:11,667
You're saying they all
lead to Mayuri's death?

297
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:13,708
Yeah.

298
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,750
But the result <i>would </i>be different

299
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,750
if there were a big enough change
to cross the 1% divergence barrier

300
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,625
and move from this alpha
world line to a beta world line.

301
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,917
--Okay. You guys use that one.
--Huh?!

302
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:29,875
W-Wait! We can't climb up on that alone!

303
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,000
Fine.

304
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,417
Wait right here.

305
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,167
Who <i>is </i>she...?

306
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:48,958
She's definitely a pro. Of some sort.

307
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:56,292
Okay, come on. Hurry.

308
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,333
The alpha and beta world lines

309
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:03,708
have very different
results--futures, in other words.

310
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,333
It's normally impossible
to travel between them.

311
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:11,542
Not even changing the past with
D-mails and time leaps will get you there.

312
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:14,583
But there are a number of points
in time where major events occur;

313
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:18,000
events with branching world
lines that lead to separate futures

314
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,208
depending on what choices are made.

315
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:24,417
Recent examples include the Gulf War in 1991,

316
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:27,292
the Y2K problem in 2000...

317
00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:30,958
...and 2010, the year the
time machine was developed.

318
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:36,167
Is that...?

319
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:40,167
Only at such branches
is it possible to move

320
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:43,042
from the alpha line to the beta line.

321
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:44,708
How do we do that?!

322
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,208
--How do we move--
--Wait!

323
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,042
First things first.

324
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:51,417
Tell us who you really are.

325
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:02,125
Is this...?

326
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,875
A time machine.

327
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:08,542
I'm from the year 2036.

328
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:10,500
Suzuha...

329
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,125
I'm the time traveler...

330
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,375
