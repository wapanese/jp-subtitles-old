00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:13,000
Rukako.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,333
Stay calm and hear what I have to say.

3
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:19,292
The truth is, you really used to be a guy.

4
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:28,833
Again with that?

5
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,667
Wait! Don't cry!

6
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:33,208
Just stay calm and hear me out!

7
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,708
This is all for Mayuri's sake.

8
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:39,792
I need you to go back to being a guy.

22
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:27,125
What's with you?

23
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:30,208
You look like you messed
up making <i>yakisoba </i>noodles

24
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,208
and tossed them all into the sink.

25
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:37,125
"You look like you worked hard to
fill up your store discount stamp card

26
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,875
but then it expired just
before you redeemed it."

27
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:43,042
...Is what I'd prefer.

28
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:46,583
Looks like you still have
enough in you to joke around.

29
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,708
Okarin!

30
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,292
Mayushii is disappointed in you!

31
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:51,875
Wh-What are you talking about?!

32
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,042
Don't pretend you don't know!

33
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:56,167
You made Ruka-<i>chan </i>cry!

34
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:57,208
H-How did <i>you </i>find out?!

35
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:01,667
She suddenly burst into tears
when I invited her to the lab!

36
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:07,583
When I asked what was wrong,
she said you called her a boy!

37
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,458
Did she tell you about the D-mail too?!

38
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,250
D-mail?

39
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,625
Don't try to talk your way out of this!

40
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:17,792
You should apologize to Ruka-<i>chan</i>!

41
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,333
Okabe!

42
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:25,167
Did you really say something so mean to her?!

43
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:26,458
W-Wait! It's not what you think!

44
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,708
--I have a reason for...!
--Like what?!

45
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,208
Come with me, Assistant!

46
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,792
--Huh?!
--Just come!

47
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:35,250
H-Hey! What are you doing?!

48
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,833
So the next D-mail I have to undo

49
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:46,458
is the one we sent to Rukako's
mother's pager before Rukako was born.

50
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:50,375
Urushibara-<i>san </i>is actually a boy...?

51
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,167
That's unbelievable.

52
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:55,792
But it's the truth... <i>was </i>the truth.

53
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:59,083
<i>Her</i>, a guy...

54
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:02,125
A guy like Hashida?

55
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:10,875
Now <i>that </i>would be bad...

56
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,458
No, he still looks exactly the same.

57
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,000
That's acceptable, then.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
At any rate, we have to
turn Rukako back into a guy

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,708
if we want to save Mayuri!

60
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:25,958
But this time you
know what her D-mail said.

61
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:30,792
Can't you just quietly undo it without
discussing the situation with her?

62
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:34,958
I don't know her mother's pager number.

63
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:39,250
Besides, I feel it would be more
responsible to tell her the truth

64
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,417
rather than resort to cheap trickery.

65
00:04:41,417 --> 00:04:44,792
And that "responsibility" wound
up making her cry, remember?

66
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:48,333
You're just playing around as usual, right?

67
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,292
You're just joking, right?

68
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:52,875
That's so mean!

69
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,375
I can't believe you'd say such things to me...!

70
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,833
I think you jinxed things for her.

71
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,125
Jinxed?

72
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,125
It's not like I said anything like,

73
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:07,542
"Once this battle is over, I'm getting married."

74
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:11,792
That's a jinx that ends in death.
I'm talking about love here.

75
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:13,042
Love?!

76
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:17,333
Yeah. Hearing her beloved
Okabe say, "You're a dude,"

77
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,375
has broken her tender heart.

78
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:23,125
B-But Rukako <i>is </i>a guy!

79
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,750
In a previous world line, maybe.

80
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:34,208
"I have something important to discuss.

81
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,333
Could you come to the shrine?"

82
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,125
Okabe-<i>san</i>.

83
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,042
Sorry about earlier.

84
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:46,750
No, I'm sorry for bursting into tears...

85
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,583
So, you had something important to discuss?

86
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:53,292
Yes. I have a favor to ask...

87
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:54,500
A favor?

88
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,917
I believe what you said.

89
00:05:57,917 --> 00:06:00,292
So, umm...

90
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:04,500
In exchange for turning back into a boy...

91
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,083
...I-I ask that you be my boyfriend!

92
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,833
Boyfriend?!

93
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,542
Wh-Why me?!

94
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,917
Because I like you.

95
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:21,208
Because I like you, Okabe-<i>san</i>!

96
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:25,000
So, tomorrow, for just one day...

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,750
...please be my boyfriend!

98
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:32,083
B-But, you're a guy--

99
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:37,292
Okay! I'll do it! Just don't cry!

100
00:06:37,292 --> 00:06:41,125
Very well! If it's just for tomorrow,
then I'll be your boyfriend!

101
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,833
R-Really?!

102
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,125
Why are you crying?!

103
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,167
I can't help it, I'm just so happy...!

104
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,500
That was actually kind of touching...

105
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:57,500
So now you're going on a date
with Urushibara-<i>san </i>tomorrow?

106
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,750
Yes.

107
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,917
A mad scientist, going on a
date with a high school girl?

108
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:04,833
Get off my back!

109
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:10,208
I'm swallowing my pride and asking
my lowly assistant for dating advice!

110
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,000
I told you, I'm <i>not </i>your assistant!

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Oh? You're going on a
date with someone, Kyouma?

112
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,667
I brought your order! Two ice coffees!

113
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:22,125
Who's the date with? Mayushii?

114
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,250
Or... maybe <i>this </i>girl?

115
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,125
No, this is my assistant.

116
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,333
I know you're trying to master
your special technique and all,

117
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:33,042
but you chase way too many girls, meow!

118
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:37,375
Oh? Way too many girls, huh?

119
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:41,792
Hey! Don't just spout misleading
statements and then leave!

120
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:49,458
Say. Would you, umm...

121
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,583
Would you do <i>anything </i>to
master your special technique?

122
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,000
Huh?

123
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,250
No, err, I mean, would Hououin
Kyouma do anything for it?!

124
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,125
Why are <i>you </i>talking about that too?

125
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:04,875
--I don't get you.
--I-I'm just asking!

126
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:08,917
I was wondering if he'd do whatever
it takes to master that technique

127
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:11,583
if there was someone he already loved...

128
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,458
--There's no meaning behind it, though!
--Why are you getting mad?!

129
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,958
I'm <i>not </i>mad!

130
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,250
Anyway, if that's how your character is,

131
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,375
then just go on a date with Urushibara-<i>san</i>!

132
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,167
I already told you I plan to!

133
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:26,000
Okarin...

134
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,958
Can you fill me in on all the juicy details too?

135
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:34,625
If you want dating advice, I'm your man!

136
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:38,958
I've had happy kissy time with dozens of girls!

137
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,042
Nene-<i>chan</i>, Shiori-<i>chan</i>,
Honoka-<i>chan, </i>Rinko-<i>chan</i>...

138
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:45,958
Those are all game characters.

139
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,375
This is a real-life date.

140
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:54,958
Somewhere popular, like Aoyama,
Omotesandou, or Nishi-Azabu...

141
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,250
"Fashionable and trendy..."

142
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,167
"Premium night..."

143
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:01,750
"Special dinner..."

144
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,542
It's no good. This stuff's a world all its own.

145
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:07,917
A world not part of reality.

146
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:10,375
But one you still have to accept.

147
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,208
I'll have you know that
the great Hououin Kyouma,

148
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:18,250
with his 170 IQ--which is the same
as Isaac Newton's, I might add--

149
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,583
finds research more interesting than girls--

150
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:25,583
You're clearly a virgin. Thank you very much.

151
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,875
What about <i>you</i>, then?!

152
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:32,625
Do you really have that much
dating experience under your belt?!

153
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,667
See!

154
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:36,000
You're so absorbed in
your studying and research

155
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,292
that you have <i>zero </i>experience in such things!

156
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:41,375
Your adolescence was clearly a lonely one!

157
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,042
Shut up! So what if I'm a virgin?!

158
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:54,625
"The key to a first date is making
the best impression possible."

159
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:59,792
"Clothing-wise, brand names are
unnecessary; a sense of cleanliness is--"

160
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:02,000
Sounds like I'm A-OK in that department.

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,917
Nothing says "clean" like a lab coat.

162
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:06,042
No one wears lab coats on dates.

163
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:08,500
"The same holds true
when choosing where to dine."

164
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,792
"Don't feel compelled to select
an overly expensive restaurant."

165
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:14,750
"Any place you visit regularly will suffice."

166
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,542
Regularly...?

167
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:19,708
--This place is out of the question.
--Obviously!

168
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:23,167
Who would have a date
in a place <i>this </i>savage?!

169
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,750
Then that just leaves...

170
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,000
...May Queen.

171
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,125
Huh?! A maid cafÃ© on your first date?!

172
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,750
--An old weapon shop.
--Weapon-shopping on a date?!

173
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,958
You're just reading straight
from a dating manual!

174
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:39,875
Quit acting so high and
mighty, you American virgin!

175
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,708
--Who are you calling an American virgin?!
--Who else but you?!

176
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,708
Yes! I'm a virgin! The end!

177
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:48,583
Uhh, maybe you'd prefer
this instead of that lousy book?

178
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,750
--That's a hentai game strategy guide!
--So?!

179
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,458
They have dates in hentai games!

180
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,958
Holding hands and stuff
is totally erotic, y'know?!

181
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,833
Walking arm in arm, with
your elbow touching her boob...

182
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,792
That's totally hot!

183
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:06,708
And then you kiss and embrace
at the end of the date! Hot damn!

184
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,333
Screw you real-lifers!

185
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:16,125
It's already morning
and I <i>still </i>don't got a plan...

186
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,583
Quit your grumbling and put it on!

187
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,250
Geez, take off the tags!

188
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,000
That's no way to tie a necktie!
You're unbelievable!

189
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,083
Sheesh! You're a lost cause!

190
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,042
There!

191
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:30,833
I feel like I'm wearing a leash now...

192
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,125
Here's a handkerchief.

193
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,042
Do you know how to use it?

194
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:38,958
Doesn't this one mean, "I'm waiting
for you, even after all this time?"

195
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,375
That's the yellow kind.

196
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:45,208
How do you even know
obscure trivia like that? That's <i>old</i>.

197
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,792
You know it too, though.

198
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:49,000
S-So?!

199
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You're actually supposed to spread
it out when a girl sits on a park bench.

200
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,208
Whatever.

201
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:59,458
I'll covertly follow you and text
you advice if anything comes up.

202
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:03,292
--You're going to follow us?!
--Yeah, Hashida too.

203
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:04,583
Huh?!

204
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:08,292
Commence Operation Valkyrie!

205
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:10,542
Why Norse mythology?

206
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,208
"When meeting your date,
time is of the utmost importance.

207
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:18,083
Be sure to arrive at<i> least </i>15 minutes early."

208
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,583
Okabe-<i>san</i>!

209
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,458
I'm sorry!

210
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:29,542
I thought I had left early...

211
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:31,667
Have you been waiting long?

212
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:36,708
Oh, no... I, uhh, just got here too...

213
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,792
That's a relief.

214
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,417
Sh-Shall we go?

215
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:45,375
Yes!

216
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:56,583
I've never seen you
without a lab coat before!

217
00:12:56,583 --> 00:13:00,625
W-Well, it <i>is </i>a date and all...

218
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,208
"When walking with a girl,

219
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,500
subtly take the side with oncoming traffic!"

220
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,208
Is something the matter?

221
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,500
Oh, no, it's nothing...!

222
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,667
Whoa! What's that?!

223
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,708
That's not subtle in the least...

224
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:18,625
"And casually guard her from
any passing cars and motorcycles!"

225
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,417
--Whoa!
--Did he guard her?!

226
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:22,708
Okabe-<i>san</i>?!

227
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,375
--Oww...
--Are you all right?

228
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,792
Wait, he just tripped?!

229
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:32,750
On top of that, a maid had to help
him up?! <i>And </i>he took her tissue pack?!

230
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,000
Miss Makise. Is it me or are you on edge?

231
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,667
Th-The weather is nice today.

232
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:45,542
Y-Yeah.

233
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,375
But there are clouds, too.

234
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,000
Yes.

235
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,500
This cake tastes very good.

236
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,750
Yes. The coffee, too.

237
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,417
Why?!

238
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:08,167
I could hold a normal
conversation just fine before,

239
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:09,833
but as soon as it turned into a date...!

240
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,917
This is a wonderful place!

241
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,875
--Do you come here often?
--No...!

242
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,083
This is going terribly!

243
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,917
"The key is to play 'conversation catch'!"

244
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:23,583
T-Today is actually my first time...

245
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,667
He tossed it back!

246
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:27,792
Speaking of firsts, today is August 14th,

247
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:31,917
the anniversary of the very
first patent issued in Japan!

248
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,792
Tossed it back <i>where</i>?!

249
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:37,250
You certainly are knowledgeable, Okabe-<i>san</i>!

250
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,208
W-Well, you know how it is...

251
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,125
Can we go now, Miss Makise?

252
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:50,042
We're no help at all;
we're just sitting here watching.

253
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:52,958
No. We have to see it through to the end.

254
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,167
Thank you for coming!

255
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,625
Umm...

256
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:03,625
Do you find it boring after all?
Going on a date with me...

257
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,125
Wha...?! D-Don't be silly!

258
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:09,292
Next is a nice walk around town! Come along!

259
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,833
Ruka-<i>chan</i>?

260
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,458
It's so hot...

261
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:23,000
He just walked straight to Ueno and back...!

262
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,250
Okabe-<i>san</i>.

263
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:35,083
Do you remember when we first met?

264
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:40,208
A bunch of men with cameras
suddenly overwhelmed me,

265
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:44,875
but then you showed up
to save the day, remember?

266
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,542
Yeah...

267
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,750
Th-Thank you!

268
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,417
I'm sorry, though...

269
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:57,000
What are you apologizing for?

270
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,708
For, well, being a boy
even though I look this way...!

271
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:09,917
It makes no difference
whether you're a boy or a girl!

272
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:12,833
None of that matters!

273
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:18,458
Those words you spoke made me so happy!

274
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:23,542
Those words are what made me like you!

275
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:27,500
"None of that matters," huh...

276
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,167
W-Wait a second!

277
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:32,458
Isn't that memory from when you were a guy?!

278
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,417
Huh? What?

279
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:37,500
What... What am I saying?

280
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,208
I'm feeling confused...

281
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,250
It's just like what happened with Faris...

282
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,208
She's regaining memories
from an earlier world line...

283
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:54,250
Thank you for today.

284
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:59,667
Being my boyfriend made me so very...

285
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:02,375
So very happy!

286
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,333
H-Hey, now!

287
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:07,042
This is my mother's pager number.

288
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:21,167
"Meat meat veggies veggies
meat meat veggies veggies..."

289
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:24,167
This should make Urushibara-<i>san</i>'s mom think

290
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:28,208
that the previous message was just a prank.

291
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,333
We're all set!

292
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,125
What's wrong, Okabe?

293
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,542
Too-too-roo!

294
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:37,333
Guess what, guess what?!

295
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:42,500
Mayushii saw Ruka-<i>chan </i>out
on a date with someone earlier!

296
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,708
Oh, that was Okarin.

297
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,833
Huh? No way!

298
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,708
That definitely wasn't Okarin!

299
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:54,500
He was wearing regular clothes
and seemed like a real gentleman!

300
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,083
Exactly!

301
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,708
That wasn't me!

302
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:01,542
Ruka didn't have a date with the real me!

303
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:03,458
Okarin?

304
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,958
O-Our date isn't over yet!

305
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,000
Huh? But, Okabe-<i>san</i>...!

306
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,250
It's "Kyouma"! Have you
forgotten my name, Rukako?!

307
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,750
All that male, female,
boyfriend, girlfriend stuff...!

308
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,083
I was the one who was confused!

309
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,958
None of that matters!

310
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:30,542
I've finally realized that I'm me
and you're you: Rukako, my pupil!

311
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,792
Right!

312
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:39,583
Good! Then go get the
Supernatural Sword Samidare!

313
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:40,833
That's it!

314
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:44,292
--Keep it up!
--Right!

315
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:47,125
Now listen well, Rukako.

316
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:50,625
The legends surrounding
this supernatural sword

317
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,125
can be traced back to the time of Yoshitsune.

318
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:57,500
On a night of a crimson full moon,

319
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,750
--Welp, there he goes...
--a wandering samurai lost his way...

320
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:04,458
That's wonderful!
He's made up with Ruka-<i>chan</i>!

321
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,625
Looks like we aren't needed anymore.

322
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:16,708
Please help Mayuri-<i>chan</i>.

323
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:20,083
The old computer you're looking for...

324
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,167
The IBN 5100?!

325
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:28,500
It <i>was </i>in our storehouse
until last New Year's Day.

326
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:34,292
But I accidentally broke it,
while I was cleaning the storehouse...

327
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:36,917
So it's my fault!

328
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:39,792
Please, Okabe-<i>san</i>!

329
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:43,750
Please save Mayuri-<i>chan</i>!

330
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:48,708
I'm really glad I was able to train
with you again. It's been so long.

331
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,125
--Ruka--
--Please go now.

332
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,667
Before I start crying...

333
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:03,708
This is the perfect time
for that secret phrase, isn't it?

334
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:07,125
El Psy Congree...

335
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:10,250
Congroo.

336
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,042
El Psy...

337
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:19,000
Honestly, I don't want to turn back.

338
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,250
If I...

339
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:27,750
If I go back to being a boy, I'll have
to seal away my feelings for you!

340
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:33,500
As a boy, I won't be
allowed to like you...!

341
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,917
Rukako...

342
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:40,000
And if I go back to being a boy,
I'll forget today ever happened, won't I?

343
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,208
I'll forget we went on a date,
that we trained together again...

344
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:50,875
That I could touch you the way I am now...

345
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:55,625
If being a girl means I have
to go through this much pain,

346
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,375
then I should never
have wished to be one!

347
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:04,000
You'll always be Rukako to me, even as a boy!

348
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,250
Nothing will change!

349
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,042
You're right.

350
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:10,333
It's like you said,
whether I'm a boy or a girl...

351
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:13,917
"None of that matters!"

352
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:16,792
Still, all I ask...

353
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:22,625
Is that you remember me
when I used to be a girl...!

354
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,667
I will. I'll never forget.

355
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,083
Never.

356
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,792
What's the matter, Okabe-<i>san</i>?

357
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:40,375
Urushibara Ruka.

358
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,833
The voice and mannerisms of a woman...

359
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:46,792
No, even more feminine than a woman.

360
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:48,583
Tell me, Rukako...

361
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:49,708
Yes?

362
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,125
Do you... like me?

363
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,250
Wh-What brought that on?!

364
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,500
Do you?

365
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,833
Umm, err...

366
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:01,000
I respect you!

367
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,083
But... he's a dude.

368
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:16,500
That just leaves one more D-mail...
