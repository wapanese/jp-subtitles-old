1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,430
Takuma, you're strong!

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,240
A monster like this is nothing when 
you fight it with three people.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,480
Want me to share my equipment with you two?

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,610
I have a lot!

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,610
Really?!

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,070
We're friends, aren't we?

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,370
All right!

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,180
"We're friends, aren't we?"

9
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,900
He's such a weird kid.

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,880
It's cool, though, since he gives us items.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,800
Man, this equipment's super strong!

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,010
It makes the monsters easy, 
even with just us two!

13
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,070
I'm starting to think we'd 
be fine without Takuma!

14
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,110
We'd be fine! Totally fine!

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,170
<i>A dream?</i>

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,700
<i>Y-You guys are clinging way too close!</i>

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,080
<i>I-It's definitely nice, though...</i>

18
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,090
Episode Seven
Change of Heart

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,090
Well,

20
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,630
I'm heading out now to 
inform Sylvie and Celes

21
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,910
about what happened with 
Prince Keera yesterday.

22
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,600
I'll go report to Lord Galford-sama.

23
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,480
Good.

24
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,100
Be careful, okay?

25
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,580
It's you who should be careful.

26
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,500
Since there's a risk of adventurers 
targeting you again,

27
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,860
Prince Keera will be coming 
here to hear your reply.

28
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,100
Please be sure not to let your guard down.

29
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,440
Fear not.

30
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,870
No matter who comes, I won't hand over Shera.

31
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,960
I'll give Nii-san a clear refusal,

32
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,860
and that'll be the end of all this!

33
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,320
There won't be any war!

34
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,000
We'll just grab our reward, 
and this quest will be complete!

35
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,190
Farewell.

36
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,260
I'll be heading off.

37
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,370
Now, then...

38
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,100
What are you doing?

39
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,640
We managed to avert a war this time,

40
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,770
but nothing good ever comes from 
slacking off on preparations.

41
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,620
I'm going to try recreating 
the potions from my world.

42
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,520
Wow! Potions?!

43
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,280
You don't become a Demon Lord overnight.

44
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,780
The truly strong are those who never fail
to make basic preparations like these.

45
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,240
<i>Still, how do I go about making them?</i>

46
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,290
<i>These don't look quite the same 
as </i>Cross Reverie<i>'s graphics.</i>

47
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,460
<i>Do I just mix them together?</i>

48
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,520
Hey, can I watch? I'll be quiet!

49
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,840
<i>The pressure!</i>

50
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,000
What's the matter?

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,300
Nothing!

52
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,390
<i>I'm so close to being able to 
see this Elf's great treasures!</i>

53
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,380
<i>I don't want potions,</i>

54
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,220
<i>I want lotion!</i>

55
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,430
<i>I don't know what I'm saying anymore!</i>

56
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,480
<i>Superb!</i>

57
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,440
Superb

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,440
Oversized

59
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,440
<i>Oversized!</i>

60
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
<i>Orbs!</i>

61
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
Orbs

62
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,000
What?!

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,070
Incredible!

64
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,190
You can make it that quickly?

65
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,070
<i>It's done?!</i>

66
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,220
I've seen professionals brew potions before,

67
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,570
but they never made them that quickly.

68
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,600
<i>I did it...</i>

69
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,520
<i>in the time it took her boobs 
to jiggle three times.</i>

70
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,580
<i>Which means if I focus on doing the task,</i>

71
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,060
<i>I do the work as my real self, 
who has no knowledge of this.</i>

72
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,080
<i>But if I let my mind 
focus on something else,</i>

73
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,750
<i>my body goes through the motions I 
perfected as a master Combiner in-game,</i>

74
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,340
<i>allowing me to complete
the potions in an instant.</i>

75
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,630
You're not making any more?

76
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,850
Oh, no, I will, but...

77
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:52,940
Shera!

78
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,680
You should pay close attention!

79
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,410
You're an adventurer, too,

80
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,970
so it's best if you can make potions, as well.

81
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,040
Now, watch only my hands!

82
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,360
Okay! I'm watching!

83
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,110
<i>I'm watching, too!</i>

84
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,720
<i>They're so jiggly...</i>

85
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,000
<i>The tips!</i>

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,370
<i>Just a little more, and the tips...</i>

87
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,380
<i>Being a master Combiner is incredible!</i>

88
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,900
Wow, amazing!

89
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,380
This is only to be expected of a Demon Lord.

90
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,840
I've never seen anything like this before!

91
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,080
You can do anything, Diablo!

92
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,640
That's incredible!

93
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,800
Huh?

94
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,140
Diablo, you're smiling?

95
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,880
Huh?!

96
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,050
As if!

97
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,690
But you usually have a much
 scarier look on your face.

98
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,770
<i>Damn it! I can't believe I did that!</i>

99
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,730
I loved that look you just had.

100
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,500
Huh?!

101
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,340
Ah, there! That one!

102
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,160
<i>Crap!</i>

103
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:57,410
<i>I haven't smiled at anyone 
since I came to this world.</i>

104
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,120
<i>Maybe someday...</i>

105
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,540
<i>I'll be able to talk to people normally,
instead of acting like a Demon Lord.</i>

106
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,790
Well, um...

107
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,130
You know...

108
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,370
I was thinking it'd be nice...

109
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,490
if moments like these could go on forever.

110
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,220
Huh?

111
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,770
<i>Wait, why am I getting all sappy?!</i>

112
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,130
<i>A sappy Demon Lord
is no Demon Lord at all!</i>

113
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,520
I can't believe you'd say 
something like that.

114
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,530
Listen, Diablo... I...

115
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,080
He's here.

116
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,770
Shera, what's the matter?

117
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,880
Listen, Diablo.

118
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,400
I need to tell you something.

119
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,180
Oh?

120
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,340
I'm...

121
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,010
going home to the Kingdom of Greenwood.

122
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,060
Huh?!

123
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,680
W-Wait... Hey...

124
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,440
What brought this on?

125
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,600
I just kind of realized...

126
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,690
Things can't stay like this.

127
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,330
Greenwood is my home,

128
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,540
and instead of using my time like this, 
I should use it for the royal family.

129
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,950
I'm going now, okay?

130
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,400
Wh-What about Rem?

131
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,710
You don't want to tell her goodbye?

132
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:24,710
It's more important that 
I go to my brother quickly.

133
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,170
Shera?!

134
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,400
Welcome back, Shera.

135
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,470
I had faith that you would return to me.

136
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,310
We both promised to respect 
Shera's decision, didn't we?

137
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,310
Well, then, we'll be going.

138
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,740
Shera...

139
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,250
Oh...

140
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,740
Diablo?

141
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,160
What's the matter?

142
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,390
You look kind of down.

143
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,300
Shera returned to Greenwood.

144
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,400
She went back?!

145
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,410
Why?!

146
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,890
I don't know.

147
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,010
Wait a minute!

148
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,370
So?

149
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,340
What are you going to do now?

150
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,400
Sleep.

151
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,020
<i>How did this happen?</i>

152
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,000
<i>Shera didn't seem like the 
kind of girl who'd lie to me.</i>

153
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,190
<i>Just yesterday, she was clear 
about not going home.</i>

154
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,000
<i>Did I step on some kind of land mine?</i>

155
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,380
I was thinking it'd be nice if moments 
like these could go on forever.

156
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,440
Diablo...

157
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,210
How long do you plan to stay like this?

158
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,170
Are you not going to rescue her?

159
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,300
That stupid Elf isn't capable 
of putting on an act.

160
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,380
If she were,

161
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,040
she would've had a much easier time in life.

162
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,090
She's slow, and she has 
trouble learning things.

163
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,070
That girl cannot tell a lie.

164
00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:00,070
And she told me about her 
dream for the future last night.

165
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,680
It was unrealistic,

166
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,040
but it was a cute dream that suited her.

167
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,790
And both you and I were present in that dream.

168
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,790
I can't imagine that she 
would ever leave us behind.

169
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,610
Don't you think there's a chance she's 
under a spell that's controlling her mind?

170
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,300
I know that much.

171
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,560
<i>When Keera came to visit,</i>

172
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,310
<i>he was playing his flute again.</i>

173
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,150
<i>That was when Shera started acting strange.</i>

174
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,400
<i>It's possible his flute 
possesses some kind of power.</i>

175
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:40,310
<i>But that flute didn't exist in </i>Cross Reverie<i>,</i>

176
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,160
<i>and most of all, I don't have any proof.</i>

177
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,040
<i>In the end, it's the same as before...</i>

178
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,440
<i>I convinced myself that we were friends,</i>

179
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,790
<i>and enjoyed the convenient misinterpretation 
that they liked me, too.</i>

180
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,420
<i>It was the pathetic delusion 
of one cast aside.</i>

181
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,910
<i>The thought that this was 
all my own misunderstanding</i>

182
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,010
<i>feels the most correct to me.</i>

183
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,670
I...

184
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,520
believe in Shera.

185
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,490
Even if this wasn't caused by magic,

186
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,660
I'm sure she's just deluded.

187
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,070
I'm going to go get Shera back.

188
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,870
What are you going to do?

189
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,280
<i>No!</i>

190
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,210
<i>Getting rejected and hurt again 
is the last thing I want!</i>

191
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,640
<i>I don't want to feel the 
pain of having my emotions</i>

192
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,220
<i>tossed around by others again!</i>

193
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,510
<i>You were the same yourself, Rem.</i>

194
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,810
<i>So why?</i>

195
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,470
<i>Why?</i>

196
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:41,930
Why?!

197
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,800
Because I'm Shera's friend.

198
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,680
I'm staying with my companions,

199
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,890
Diablo and Rem, now.

200
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,640
Diablo? Be careful.

201
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,770
Hey! Only Rem?

202
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,900
I belong to you too, right?

203
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,640
Thanks for saving me.

204
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,150
Listen, Diablo...

205
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:04,820
I wish moments like these 
could go on forever, too.

206
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,780
You should wait, Rem.

207
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,260
If you storm the Elven camp on your own,

208
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,610
there's no guaranteeing your safety.

209
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,700
I'm not giving up until I see Shera again.

210
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,810
How interesting.

211
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,560
You'd face such hardship

212
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,230
just to see someone who left you behind?

213
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,480
Rem Galleu!

214
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,930
You are one of the two who summoned me!

215
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,860
So I ask you this!

216
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,110
Do you desire this Demon Lord's power?!

217
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,660
Yes!

218
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,990
I want your power,

219
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,830
Demon Lord Diablo!

220
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,090
Very well!

221
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,750
Then, to fulfill your objective,

222
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,590
I shall show you a glimpse 
of my substantial power!

223
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,960
I shall go, as well.

224
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,760
Alicia-san?

225
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,590
I can't accept what's happening 
to Shera-sama, either.

226
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,960
This might mean casting aside your 
status as an Imperial Knight.

227
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,660
What I strive to defend isn't my status.

228
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,350
It's people in trouble.

229
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,870
Besides...

230
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,480
I can't just leave Rem-sama alone, either.

231
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,280
Alicia-san...

232
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,280
Hmph.

233
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,110
I thought I told you that you don't 
need to try to be useful.

234
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,610
You're the type that draws the short 
straw surprisingly often, aren't you?

235
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,620
Yes!

236
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,510
All right! Let's go!

237
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,420
We're going to take Shera 
back from that stupid prince!

238
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,250
Yes!

239
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,250
Yes!

240
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,900
It's pointless to resist, Shera.

241
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,580
You know that this flute is the 
secret art of our kind, right?

242
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,690
When I saw you yesterday,

243
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:11,910
I played a tune only Elves can 
hear that was imbued with a spell.

244
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,560
It's already impossible for 
you to defy this flute.

245
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,740
I can overwrite your will however I please.

246
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,010
It was truly a masterpiece!

247
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,630
The look that Demon had on his face

248
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,080
when you betrayed him after
he placed so much faith in you!

249
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,360
Now, Shera, I'm overwriting you.

250
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,860
You'll want to answer my questions now.

251
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,360
Yes.

252
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,060
You can ask me anything.

253
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:43,500
What did that Diablo demand of you?

254
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,180
What kind of orders did he give you?

255
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,070
Orders?

256
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:51,390
He's given you all kinds of orders 
using that Enslavement Collar, right?

257
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,480
Tell me.

258
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,510
How did he make you serve him?

259
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,820
I'll do even more incredible things to you.

260
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,840
Orders?

261
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,080
He only ever ordered me once.

262
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,340
To shake hands with Rem, with a smile.

263
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,460
You fool!

264
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,140
That's not what I meant!

265
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,930
But he never gave me any other orders!

266
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,620
Seriously?

267
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,930
Whatever.

268
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,040
Either way, you can't run away anymore.

269
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,440
I'll teach your body thoroughly...

270
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,190
just who you belong to.

271
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,520
What was that sound?

272
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,830
Jeez, and I was just about to...

273
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,410
What's that?

274
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,740
You don't need to be scared.

275
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,670
It's just a Slime.

276
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,370
N-No!

277
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,180
It'll melt me and eat me!

278
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,170
If it were a carnivorous one.

279
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,560
This is a breed that only eats fabric.

280
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,300
Huh?

281
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,810
What are you going to do 
after melting my clothes?

282
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,310
That's obvious, isn't it?

283
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,420
I'm preparing you to create my heir.

284
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,810
No!

285
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,810
No...

286
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:12,870
No!

287
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,650
It burns!

288
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:18,170
It feels like I'm being 
licked by a huge tongue!

289
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,870
So you like it behind your knee, huh?

290
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,410
What a dirty girl.

291
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,900
Wh-What are you saying?

292
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,800
This just feels gross!

293
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,420
No!

294
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:38,720
You sure are hanging in there, silly Shera!

295
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,760
Nii-san...

296
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,640
I hate you, Nii-san!

297
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,150
I know.

298
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,860
Don't irritate me too much, now.

299
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,280
You'll make me want to kill 
you before I create my heir.

300
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,280
I'd rather die than let you do this to me!

301
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,400
I wonder how long you can 
keep up that tough act.

302
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,040
No!

303
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,040
No!

304
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,880
No!

305
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,440
Help me...

306
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:19,920
Help me!

307
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,880
You're so annoying.

308
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,060
Fine, then. I'll overwrite you.

309
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,310
To make you want to offer 
your entirety up to me!

310
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,570
Help me, Diablo!

311
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,530
Sorry I kept you waiting, Shera.

312
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,440
Diablo!

313
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,670
My, my. What's the meaning of barging 
into a prince's camp while he's busy

314
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,290
attending to official duties?

315
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,080
You call this an official duty?

316
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,560
I can't believe you're such scum.

317
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,670
Even royalty can't get away with that!

318
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,510
It's just a bit of entertainment.

319
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,640
It's better when it's exciting, right?

320
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,300
For both the man and the woman.

321
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,310
I knew it. I was wrong.

322
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:08,430
I should have kept Shera from 
going with you back then,

323
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,860
even if it meant turning the 
city into a sea of flames.

324
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,900
Sorry I was late.

325
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,180
Diablo...

326
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,040
You really... really came for me.

327
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,830
Shera!

328
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,170
Shera-sama!

329
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,180
Tsk.

330
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,420
Look at you, pretending to be friends.

331
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,980
How did my guards fail to notice intruders?

332
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,040
What are they doing?!

333
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,920
You didn't hear all the noise outside?

334
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,410
What is this?!

335
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,530
What's going on?!

336
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,810
What happened to my guards?!

337
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,400
Keera-sama...

338
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
Quit screwing around!

339
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,050
Do you know what you've done?!

340
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,510
This is an international issue!

341
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,410
Do you want a war?!

342
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,150
I only came here to confirm one thing.

343
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,710
Whether or not Shera truly wanted to go home.

344
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,370
You manipulated Shera 
with your vile methods.

345
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,660
Your proof!

346
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,130
Where's your proof?!

347
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,450
I don't need any proof.

348
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:21,530
I just need to ask Shera how 
she truly feels one more time.

349
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,890
Hey, Shera! Tell him!

350
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,020
What is it that you need to do?!

351
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,680
I have to return to Greenwood.

352
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,520
Shera?!

353
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,120
Greenwood is my home,

354
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,530
so I need to stop using my time like 
this and use it for my homeland.

355
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,420
Please get a hold of yourself!

356
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:47,660
Hear her? You satisfied now, Demon?!

357
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,970
So what about it?

358
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:49,660
Huh?

359
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,920
Shera!

360
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,080
As the owner of your Enslavement Collar,
 I command you!

361
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,010
Express your true feelings as 
they exist, unbound by any magic!

362
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:02,970
Shera?!

363
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,050
Shera-sama?!

364
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,420
Hey, Shera!

365
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,990
Don't be swayed by him!

366
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,310
Overwrite! Overwrite! Overwrite!

367
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,740
Shera-sama! Don't give in!

368
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,440
Tell us the real truth, Shera!

369
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,820
You belong to me, Shera!

370
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,570
Shera,

371
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,900
tell me...

372
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,080
how you really feel.

373
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,840
I...

374
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,810
I want to be free!

375
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:47,850
I want to be with Diablo 
and Rem forever and ever!

376
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,600
My friends are what's most precious to me!

377
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,880
You deserve to face judgment, Keera.

378
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,240
Tsk!

379
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,800
Useless, useless, useless!

380
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,490
Everyone and everything keeps 
pissing me the hell off!

381
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,920
None of this is any fun!

382
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,000
You're a damn commoner acting pretentious!

383
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:15,050
Nii-san! That Summon's dangerous!

384
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,000
You're all sentenced to death!

385
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,680
The secret art of the Elves 
will destroy this entire world!

386
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,630
If there's nothing for me to enjoy in 
this world, then it can just perish!

387
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,300
Very well.

388
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,390
If you dare to challenge me,
then I'll give you your just reward.

389
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,140
Come forth, Force Hydra!

390
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,280
It's huge!

391
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,030
No way!

392
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,010
Run, Diablo!

393
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,270
You can't beat that Summon!

394
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,560
It's the Elven nation's trump card!

395
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,080
It's too late! Now, regret your actions!

396
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,610
Die, Demon!

397
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,510
What the hell are you?!

398
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,520
Pay for your many mistakes with your death!

399
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,990
No!

400
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,990
Keera-sama!

401
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:40,020
It's not good for us if you
decide to spare him on your own.

402
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,020
