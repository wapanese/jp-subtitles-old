00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:06,360
<i>The Fantasy MMORPG, </i>Cross Reverie<i>,</i>

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,800
<i>is currently the most-played
game in the world.</i>

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,280
<i>In this game, there is only one person 
known as a true Demon Lord.</i>

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,070
<i>His name is Demon Lord Diablo.</i>

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,760
<i>Diablo is not an official monster.</i>

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,000
<i>He's a legendary player who reigns at the 
top with his overwhelming gear and skill.</i>

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,080
<i>Diablo is ridiculously strong,</i>

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,120
<i>so what causes him to get serious?</i>

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,830
<i>Is it the rarity of his challengers' gear?</i>

10
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,280
<i>The titles they've earned?</i>

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,610
<i>No,</i>

12
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,770
<i>what makes him get serious is...</i>

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,770
Michiko LOVE

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,770
RYO's Wife

15
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,770
Oh, those two are a couple.

16
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,500
Time to kill 'em.

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,110
Fools who bring impurities like
love into the game world

18
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,110
The Demon Lord's Ring reflects all magic

19
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,110
Magic Reflection

20
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,110
Magic Reflection

21
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,070
must be punished by me, the Demon Lord!

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,680
MMOs aren't mere <i>games</i>!

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,320
Have you learned your lesson, normies?!

24
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,530
<i>Also, this is me.</i>

25
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,120
<i>A shut-in gamer named Takuma Sakamoto.</i>

26
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,600
<i>At this point in time, I never even imagined</i>

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,880
<i>that I would be summoned to another 
world as a real Demon Lord.</i>

28
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,100
Huh?

29
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,030
Episode One
The Demon Lord Act

30
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,530
<i>I've turned into Diablo?!</i>

31
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,530
<i>What is this?!</i>

32
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,040
<i>I was just playing games in my room!</i>

33
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,640
Now the Enslavement Ritual is complete.

34
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,500
Huh?

35
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,240
Way to go, me! The summoning worked!

36
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,350
Try not to get the wrong idea.

37
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,360
I'm the one who summoned him.

38
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,920
Huh? But I'm the one who summoned him!

39
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,520
<i>What are those ears? Is she a Pantherian?</i>

40
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,520
You saw it, didn't you?

41
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,910
Besides, I performed the 
Enslavement Ritual myself, too!

42
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,110
<i>That girl's... an Elf?</i>

43
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,850
That kiss and stuff...

44
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:29,980
<i>Kiss?!</i>

45
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,650
<i>That wasn't a dream?!</i>

46
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,730
<i>I should have enjoyed it more!</i>

47
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,600
<i>Wait, where am I?</i>

48
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,040
I kissed him, too.

49
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,740
But it was <i>my</i> kiss that was successful!

50
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,740
<i>This clearly isn't my neighborhood.</i>

51
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,290
I'm also the one who said we 
should go to Starfall Tower!

52
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,740
<i>Starfall Tower?</i>

53
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:52,460
<u>Starfall Tower</u>
A stone tower located on the border of the Kingdom of Lyferia and the old Demon Lord's domain,
adjacent to the Man-Eating Woods. The closest town is the Border City, Faltra. It is a point used for
summoning and conducting the Enslavement Ritual. This tower is often the first destination of Summoners.

54
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,560
<i>Starfall Tower.</i>

55
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,210
<i>A summoning point in </i>Cross Reverie<i>.</i>

56
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,830
<i>It's supposed to be a spot where you 
can summon and enslave new Summons.</i>

57
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,750
<i>But was I...</i>

58
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,360
<i>Did these girls summon 
me into </i>Cross Reverie<i>?!</i>

59
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,400
<i>I get the feeling it's okay to follow them.</i>

60
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,760
<i>Wait, no, no, no, no!</i>

61
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,890
I did!

62
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,890
No, I did!

63
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,890
U-Um, uh...

64
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,270
<i>How am I supposed to talk to girls?!</i>

65
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,520
<i>How long has it been since 
I spoke to anyone?!</i>

66
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,030
<i>Wait, have I ever spoken to anyone?!</i>

67
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,780
<i>I can only remember 
soloing for my entire life!</i>

68
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,030
<i>No, I have! I have!</i>

69
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,040
<i>I've held conversations with the 
girls who challenged me in-game!</i>

70
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,780
You should cease your trivial arguing.

71
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,340
You currently stand before Diablo.

72
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,140
The Summon...

73
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,440
...talked?!

74
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,240
<i>The game's helping me out.</i>

75
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,620
<i>If I do the Demon Lord act that I did for
my opponents, I can make this work!</i>

76
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,620
I hereby command you both...

77
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,490
Shake hands and make up.

78
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,560
With a smile!

79
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,050
Who would ever want to 
make up with this fat Elf?

80
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,290
What?!

81
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,030
What's going on here?

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,890
Huh?

83
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,710
Huh?

84
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:17,980
Huh?!

85
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,220
Huh?!

86
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,240
Why us?

87
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,580
I thought this was supposed
to appear on the Summon!

88
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,890
I was sure the ritual that would place 
the slave collar on him succeeded...

89
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:37,900
Y...

90
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,360
You used the Enslavement Ritual on me?

91
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,220
Yes.

92
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,680
<i>Right!</i>

93
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,240
<i>The effect of my Demon Lord's Ring!</i>

94
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,600
<i>It's one of the most powerful accessories 
in </i>Cross Reverie,<i> and it reflects all magic.</i>

95
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,760
The Demon Lord's Ring reflects all magic

96
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,740
<i>I obtained it as an event reward,</i>

97
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,740
Magic Reflection

98
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,740
Magic Reflection

99
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,000
<i>but it looks like its power 
is still active here.</i>

100
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,520
Magic has no effect on me.

101
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,670
I possess the power to reflect all magic,

102
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,660
so your Enslavement Ritual 
was cast on yourselves instead.

103
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,880
What?!

104
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,680
I don't want to be enslaved to a Summon!

105
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,890
At any rate, we'll need to return to the 
city and look for a way to dispel it.

106
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,400
You're coming with us too, okay?

107
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,140
<i>Well, I wouldn't want them leaving me behind.</i>

108
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,460
Oh, yeah! We haven't told you our names yet.

109
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,120
Good grief, but you're carefree. 
At a time like this, too.

110
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,420
But won't it be difficult 
for him to talk to us?

111
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,210
I'm Shera L Greenwood.

112
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,670
For various reasons, I'm hoping 
to become an adventurer.

113
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,040
Nice to meet you.

114
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,980
I'm Rem Galleu.

115
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,880
I need to keep proving my 
strength as an adventurer,

116
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,200
so please lend me your power.

117
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,660
Diablo must be worth a hundred men!

118
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,880
I've never heard of a talking Summon before!

119
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,190
Fools!

120
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,570
I am no Summon!

121
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,470
Then what are you?

122
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,260
<i>I'm just a plain old shut-in.</i>

123
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,920
<i>But I can't tell them that...</i>

124
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,320
I am Diablo.

125
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,450
The one feared as the Demon Lord!

126
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,960
Demon Lord?

127
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,860
That was my first summon, 
and I summoned an amazing one!

128
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,330
I summoned him.

129
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,660
No, I did!

130
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,590
I did!

131
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,160
<i>I </i>did!

132
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,010
Jeez, all you two do is fight!

133
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,830
I thought we were heading into the city!

134
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,690
We are going there!

135
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,590
With you at my side, I can finally register 
as a Summoner with the Adventurer's Guild!

136
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,700
<i>Jeez, how did this all happen? 
There's so much I don't know.</i>

137
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,350
<i>The only thing I do know is...</i>

138
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,600
<i>That girl's awesome!</i>

139
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,980
Border City Faltra

140
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,760
Thank you so much for today.

141
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,740
It's fine.

142
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,430
We're here.

143
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,740
This is the inn.

144
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,290
Good afternoon!

145
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,540
I'm Mei-chan, the idol of Peace of Mind Inn!

146
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,030
Diablo?

147
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,230
What are you doing?

148
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,780
We're staying at this inn.

149
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,780
<i>Th-The crowds are making me nauseous...</i>

150
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,840
Hey, I'd like to have this man 
stay in the same room with me.

151
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:21,050
Hey! You can't be telling me to share 
the same room with the likes of you?!

152
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,850
Well, I don't have the 
money to rent an extra one.

153
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,400
There's no need for that.

154
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,610
Diablo will be staying in my room.

155
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,760
Huh?! Why?!

156
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,200
I'm the one who summoned Diablo.

157
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,860
<i>Th-This is impossible.</i>

158
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,860
It's natural for him to stay with his master.

159
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,280
I'm the one who summoned him!

160
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,130
C'mon, you're just being a nuisance 
if you fight at our reception desk!

161
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,220
I did!

162
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,050
I did!

163
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:39,950
I did!

164
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,640
I did!

165
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,870
I'll throw you out.

166
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,280
How did I end up sharing a room with you?

167
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,130
That's my question.

168
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,450
<i>Two girls in a room with only one bed...</i>

169
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:02,080
<i>Is this leading to some actual 
nighttime Demon Lord play?!</i>

170
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,760
<i>No way! I couldn't handle it! I'd die!</i>

171
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,970
Come in.

172
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,270
Pardon me.

173
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,110
Rem-san, everyone...

174
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,680
It's my first time meeting you two, isn't it?

175
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,870
I'm known as Celestine Baudelaire.

176
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,730
<i>Celestine? That sounds familiar...</i>

177
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,830
Do you mean the head of this 
town's Mage's Association?

178
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,700
That Celestine?

179
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,090
Call me Celes, okay?

180
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,610
<i>That's right!</i>

181
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,260
<i>I knew I'd heard her name before!</i>

182
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,140
<i>The head of the Mage's Association</i>

183
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,000
<i>is an important character who maintains 
the barrier protecting this town.</i>

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,760
<i>At least in the game, she was.</i>

185
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,520
<i>What is someone that important doing here?</i>

186
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,790
Today, I had some business 
with Rem-san, but...

187
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,940
I'd love to hear your story, as well.

188
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,710
Food! Food!

189
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,960
Proper food!

190
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,210
A reflection of the Enslavement Ritual?

191
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,120
That's quite a serious matter.

192
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,470
Diablo-san, are you able to 
release them, by any chance?

193
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,040
I can't.

194
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,690
It wasn't even my choice to enslave them.

195
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,730
If I could release them,
I would have already.

196
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,780
Looks like we'll have to research 
this from scratch, then.

197
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,480
Please do.

198
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,270
By the way, what business did the head 
of the Mage's Association have here?

199
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,480
I'll permit you to share that with me.

200
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,860
You bastard!

201
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,680
How dare you speak to 
Lady Baudelaire like that?!

202
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,830
I'll have no mercy on you 
if you don't show respect!

203
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,710
<i>Man, this guy is scary!</i>

204
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,880
<i>Was I being that haughty?</i>

205
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,420
<i>But I can't help it!</i>

206
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,590
<i>I can't get myself to talk any other way!</i>

207
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,020
Galluk-san...

208
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:01,840
Don't speak to me so lightly, plebeian!

209
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,880
Galluk-san, you're being rude.

210
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,360
<i>Talking to others is so exhausting...</i>

211
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,240
Celes, I don't want to go the 
Mage's Association Headquarters,

212
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,670
and I don't want any 
bodyguards assigned to me.

213
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:23,370
Rem-san... Listen, I'm only
trying to help you.

214
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:28,560
You're very important to our world.

215
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,820
I'm grateful for your consideration.

216
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,350
But I can protect myself.

217
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,460
I see.

218
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,280
I'll excuse myself for tonight.

219
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,920
I'll look into the matter of 
releasing you from your collars.

220
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,300
Thank you.

221
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:47,860
Excuse me.

222
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,160
For a such a powerful individual 
to be visiting you...

223
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,130
You must be holding on to 
an extraordinary secret.

224
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,680
That's not true.

225
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,280
Oh?

226
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,900
<i>My gamer's intuition is tingling!</i>

227
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,950
<i>The problem this girl's facing 
is important to the storyline!</i>

228
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,840
<i>The kind that makes the 
powerful go out of their way,</i>

229
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,580
Why is the king in such a lowly tavern?

230
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,760
<i>that she can't easily share with others!</i>

231
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:17,290
I have a terrifying secret. I can't 
share it with you yet, though.

232
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,790
<i>The kind that suddenly gets 
revealed when it's too late,</i>

233
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,530
<i>but could've been easily dealt with 
if only we all knew earlier!</i>

234
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:21,170
I'll end this world!
There's no other option for me!

235
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,470
<i>I have to uncover her 
secret as soon as possible!</i>

236
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,220
You're light.

237
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,350
Hey!

238
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,810
Where are you going?

239
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,050
This one refuses to speak,

240
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,850
so I'm going to torture her.

241
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,350
Tor—

242
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,060
Okay, I'll be here with my food.

243
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,360
Hey! Save me, you stupid Elf!

244
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,520
Fear not. I won't do
anything that could kill you.

245
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,910
Not so long as you tell me your secret.

246
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,990
I don't want to share it.

247
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,090
So you ask me to lend you my power 
while keeping secrets from me?

248
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,970
If I tell you, I'm sure you'll leave me, too.

249
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:06,470
Did you think a Demon Lord would 
grant mercy for such a reason?

250
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,800
I guess I will need to torture you.

251
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,460
Are you planning to disgrace me?!

252
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,060
Huh?

253
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,020
<i>I hadn't thought of that!</i>

254
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:21,400
<i>I was so focused on clearing this story, 
I ended up in a total away game!</i>

255
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,140
<i>I pushed her down in the heat of the moment,</i>

256
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,860
<i>but how do I torture her?</i>

257
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,820
<i>It feels criminal to touch her anywhere.</i>

258
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,450
<i>M-Maybe right here would be okay?</i>

259
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:36,780
<i>This works!</i>

260
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,330
<i>It's a way lower hurdle than
her bare skin, too!</i>

261
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,630
Could you please stop?

262
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,040
Tell me your secret.

263
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,220
I can't!

264
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,850
That's it, then.

265
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,090
They're fluffy.

266
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,640
No! Stop!

267
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,740
Then how about here?

268
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,900
Not behind my ears!

269
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,840
Will you share your secret?

270
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,500
I-I won't tell you!

271
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,160
Stubborn woman.

272
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,920
In that case...

273
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,510
<i>This reminds me of the stray 
cat I used to play with!</i>

274
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,140
<i>It's so nice and fluffy!</i>

275
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,540
<i>It's so easy to get absorbed—</i>

276
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,050
<i>Sh-Shoot!</i>

277
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,870
<i>I got carried away!</i>

278
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,250
<i>Crap... If she gives me that look...</i>

279
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,050
<i>What do I do next?!</i>

280
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,560
Are you...

281
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,810
saying you'll accept me, then?

282
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,670
That no matter what,

283
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,440
you won't run away?

284
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,860
Rem...

285
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:53,830
You can count on me.

286
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,000
No matter what your circumstances may be,

287
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,710
I, the Demon Lord Diablo, 
will accept them along with you.

288
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,210
Rest assured.

289
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,540
Huh?

290
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,380
No!

291
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,900
It's overwhelming me!

292
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,690
I just heard a really loud voice...

293
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,920
Lady, are you sure you 
don't need to go in there?

294
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,830
Huh?!

295
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,690
That's your companion, isn't it?

296
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,360
Y-Yes, it is...

297
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,320
All right!

298
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,470
But first, another plate for me, please!

299
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,450
Seriously?!

300
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,540
A-Are you hurt?

301
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,060
No, I'm happy.

302
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,970
You said you'd accept me, 
no matter the circumstances.

303
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,650
Indeed.

304
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:56,790
No one has ever said that to me.

305
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:06,480
The soul of the Demon Lord 
Krebskulm is sealed within me.

306
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:07,820
<i>What?!</i>

307
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,110
<i>Krebskulm?!</i>

308
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,800
<i>That's officially the most 
powerful boss in </i>Cross Reverie<i>!</i>

309
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,760
<i>I never expected to hear that name.</i>

310
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,940
<i>So I really am inside </i>Cross Reverie<i>?</i>

311
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,320
My ultimate goal is to defeat the Demon 
Lord Krebskulm that lies within me

312
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,440
and extinguish her soul.

313
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,380
Makes sense.

314
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,210
Judging from the conversation 
with Celes, then,

315
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:37,580
it seems fair to assume the Demon 
Lord Krebskulm will be released

316
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,320
when you die.

317
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,900
On top of that,

318
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,500
there's presently no way to extract 
her soul aside from your death.

319
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,100
If they did have a means to extract her,

320
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,400
they'd surround you with the full 
military might of the world, pull her out,

321
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,190
and defeat her.

322
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,470
Also, judging by the way 
those around you act,

323
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,840
Celes is the only person who knows 
about your connection to Krebskulm.

324
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,600
Am I wrong?

325
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,450
Y-You've got it.

326
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,690
Her soul will be released when I die.

327
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,880
Celes knows of this fact.

328
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,960
Hmm...

329
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,840
Did your mother also house 
the soul of Krebskulm?

330
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,300
<i>So it's hereditary.</i>

331
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,850
<i>What a cruel fate for such a girl.</i>

332
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,140
<i>If this was part of the game lore, 
I'd be railing on the developers.</i>

333
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:32,880
Hmph. I'll crush the soul 
of Krebskulm for you.

334
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:39,220
Of course, we'll need to spend some time 
researching a way to extract it first.

335
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,250
Did I do something?!

336
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,620
That was the first time anyone 
said they wouldn't leave me.

337
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,000
You underestimate me too much.

338
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,010
I'm not so weak as to leave 
you over something that petty.

339
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,620
<i>I'm used to being alone.</i>

340
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,470
<i>Both in-game and in real life, 
I've always played solo.</i>

341
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,190
<i>Telling me to change that now,
after all this time,</i>

342
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,790
<i>doesn't mean someone with my poor social
skills will become very useful to others.</i>

343
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,290
<i>So then, why...</i>

344
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,630
Hey, Demon!

345
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,470
You're that guy from this afternoon!

346
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,440
You're Celes's...

347
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,830
We can't stand by and watch you 
wander around this late at night.

348
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,980
Demihumans are savages, after all!

349
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,380
What? Running away?

350
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,460
I told you not to speak to me lightly.

351
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,750
I have no time for plebeians.

352
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,960
Hold it!

353
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,200
I'm no plebeian. I'm Galluk!

354
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,580
I won't overlook your rude attitude!

355
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:15,080
You would preach manners while 
throwing liquor bottles at someone?

356
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,230
I'm close to the head of the 
Mage's Association in rank!

357
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,860
I'm not trash like you, 
who isn't useful to anyone!

358
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:33,190
I didn't like you from the 
moment I laid eyes on you.

359
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,510
This is the end of your rude attitude!

360
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:48,010
After this, you'll be begging for your life!

361
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,850
It's the most powerful Summon,

362
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,790
able to burn everything to death!

363
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,450
Come forth, Salamander!

364
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:01,760
Galluk! You're using a Summon in the city?!

365
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,300
Shut up!

366
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,250
This is a level 30 Salamander!

367
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,640
If you apologize now, I'll let
you off with a few burns...

368
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,910
Though it might be too 
powerful and kill you anyway!

369
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,730
Really? You're kidding...

370
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,570
Level 30?

371
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,780
That's so weak, though.

372
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,750
Y-You've done it now!

373
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,580
Shut up! This is punishment!

374
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,310
That's it?

375
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,220
I guess that's all a level 30 could do.

376
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,500
Wha?!

377
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,470
K-Kill him, Salamander!

378
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,220
Kill him, kill him, kill him!

379
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,110
Kill that insolent good-for-nothing!

380
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,210
Let me tell you something.

381
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,240
I'm level 150.

382
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,700
O-One hundred and fifty?!

383
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,230
No way!

384
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,780
No one like that...

385
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,410
No one like that can exist!

386
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,290
Kill him!

387
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,220
Explosion!

388
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:26,010
Don't expect mercy from me.

389
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,400
Wh-What?!

390
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,900
This...

391
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,650
This is impossible!

392
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,920
<i>I thought I held back quite a bit.</i>

393
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,660
<i>I guess my strength is the same as Diablo's.</i>

394
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:58,200
<i>So the power I amassed by immersing 
myself in the game is now my power.</i>

395
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,680
You're just a demihuman...

396
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,410
You're useless trash.

397
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,610
How could this be?

398
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,430
What in the world are you?!

399
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,290
My name is Diablo!

400
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,930
I am a Demon Lord from another world!

401
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:34,520
Once you finish registering as an adventurer,
you'll be able to take on quests.

402
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,720
I look forward to working 
with you, Diablo-san.

403
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,510
Remove that collar from Shera-sama's neck!

404
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,060
Episode Two
The Strongest Newcomer

405
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,060
Diablo!
