1
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,240
<i>It wasn't a dream?</i>

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,490
<i>I really am in another world.</i>

3
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,530
<i>Honestly, I can't tell 
if I'm inside the game,</i>

4
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,750
<i>or if this is just another world
that's similar to </i>Cross Reverie<i>.</i>

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,060
<i>I might need to try looking into some things.</i>

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,460
<i>What is this unfamiliar sensation?</i>

7
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,550
<i>Her boob?!</i>

8
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,800
<i>D-D-Don't panic!</i>

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,350
<i>A Demon Lord doesn't panic!</i>

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,470
<i>Gently remove your hand!</i>

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,230
<i>My hand is acting on its own?!</i>

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,230
<i>Left hand? Left hand?!</i>

13
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,670
<i>My mind is refusing to take my hand away?!</i>

14
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,510
<i>My left hand is out of control!</i>

15
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,120
<i>Help me, right hand!</i>

16
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,120
<i>Wait, this one, too?!</i>

17
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,580
<i>They're budding?!</i>

18
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,870
<i>This is a perfect harmony 
of solidity and softness!</i>

19
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,920
<i>And this other one absorbs my 
fingers like a bottomless swamp,</i>

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,460
<i>yet it's firm enough to press back!</i>

21
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,600
<i>Boobs are awesome!</i>

22
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,770
<i>Still, any longer and this'll be bad!</i>

23
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,130
<i>It'll be social death for me!</i>

24
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,510
Diablo?

25
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,060
I don't think it's good to do things like this!

26
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,820
Y-You absolutely shouldn't 
do things like this until

27
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,070
you choose me as your master, okay?!

28
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,100
<i>You'll allow it if I choose you?!</i>

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,180
What's going on? Mew two are so noisy...

30
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,640
<i>Oh, no!</i>

31
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,580
<i>I'm a Demon Lord.</i>

32
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,800
<i>Roleplay the Demon Lord.</i>

33
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,840
<i>Act boldly, with dignity...</i>

34
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,200
Rem, hold your chest out proudly.

35
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,470
Your budding breasts are valuable assets, too.

36
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,020
Episode 2
Strongest Newcomer

37
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,480
Rem, are you still mad about this morning?

38
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,980
I'm not mad.

39
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,720
Please drop the subject.

40
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,490
You're totally mad.

41
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,550
<i>Dwarves, Grasswalkers, Pantherians...</i>

42
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,790
<i>Elves...</i>

43
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,630
<i>And Demons.</i>

44
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,630
<i>Although I thought Humans were 
the most common race in-game.</i>

45
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,080
I don't see any Humans here. Why is that?

46
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,600
This is the block where demihumans live.

47
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,640
Hardly any Humans come here.

48
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,790
<i>So there's an even greater divide</i>

49
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,150
<i>between Humans and demihumans in 
this world than there was in-game.</i>

50
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,780
<i>That guy last night seemed to 
have a beef with me, too.</i>

51
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,410
<i>He even called out his level 30
or whatever Summon.</i>

52
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,220
Does this world measure strength 
with the concept of level?

53
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,520
Y-Yeah, by levels...

54
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,160
Though I don't have mine yet.

55
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,370
I'm a level 40 Summoner.

56
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,420
The Adventurer's Guild we're heading to 
has a means of assessing your level.

57
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,210
Oh?

58
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,640
Oh, yeah! The reason I don't have a level is

59
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,790
because I haven't registered 
as an adventurer yet,

60
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,410
so I could be 40 or 50 when they measure me!

61
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,830
Your level is probably around 10 or so.

62
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,770
It must be at least 10 below average.

63
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,460
That's not true!

64
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,150
It is.

65
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,020
Is not!

66
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,150
Is.

67
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,560
I said it's not!

68
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,100
<i>This area was supposed to be 
level 60 in-game, give or take.</i>

69
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,680
I said it is.

70
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,040
Not! Not! Not! Not! Not!
I'm telling you, it's <i>not</i>!

71
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,410
<i>Is this whole world operating
at a reduced level?</i>

72
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,780
Once we're registered with the Adventurer's
Guild, we'll be able to accept quests.

73
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,910
Both of you are going to earn your lodging.

74
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,210
Hey, were you licking it?!

75
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,920
Like I'd lick it! That's gross!

76
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,010
What'd you say?!

77
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,840
<i>S-S-Scary!</i>

78
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,950
<i>What is this savage place?!</i>

79
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:35,340
I know it's a bit obnoxious, 
but this happens all the time.

80
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,850
We register as adventurers 
on the second floor.

81
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,060
Good.

82
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,970
Uh, I'm Shera L. Greenwood.

83
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,070
I was born in...

84
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,200
<i>I can't read this writing!</i>

85
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,980
Listen, I dislike such tedious work.

86
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,160
Fill mine out for me.

87
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,330
I can?!

88
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,330
Yes.

89
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,740
Yay!

90
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,010
It's kind of like I'm the master now!

91
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,840
Now then, to finish up,
please place your blood seal here.

92
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,600
<i>Blood seal?</i>

93
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,690
It's fine. Just a little prick.

94
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,380
I don't like this...

95
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,000
Hmph. You'll never succeed as an adventurer

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,940
if you balk at something like this.

97
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,130
<i>It's not scary. It's fine.</i>

98
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,270
<i>It's just like a shot.</i>

99
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,360
<i>There!</i>

100
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,280
<i>I cut it too much!</i>

101
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,870
So next...

102
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,540
What's this?

103
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,000
A mirror that measures the 
strength of your magic power.

104
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,880
There's nothing reflected in it, though.

105
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,010
Touch it with your hand, and try 
filling it with magic power.

106
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,030
L-Like this?

107
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,200
Wow, that's incredible!

108
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,780
Let's see...

109
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,680
It's clear enough to count your eyelashes 
and goes all the way down to your chest,

110
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,520
so your level is...

111
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,940
How high? How high?

112
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,530
30!

113
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,940
No way!

114
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,940
I lost to Rem?

115
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,410
You were overreaching if you 
thought you could surpass me.

116
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,450
I'll surpass you in no time, Rem!

117
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,520
You can spend your whole 
life looking up at me.

118
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,780
<i>If she's level 30 in this lower level world,</i>

119
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,780
What?!

120
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,810
<i>then that's a relatively high evaluation.</i>

121
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,970
You'll never be able to catch up to me.

122
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,550
Uh, next person, please.

123
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,830
You're going to regret saying that!

124
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,580
Right.

125
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,040
<i>How do I focus magic power into this?</i>

126
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,430
What is that?!

127
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,690
That's scary!

128
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,340
<i>This looks dangerous!</i>

129
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,820
What was that wave just now?!

130
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,860
Guildmaster! U-Uh...

131
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,100
<i>Guildmaster? Her?</i>

132
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:04,670
I'm Sylvie, Guildmaster of the 
Adventurer's Guild here in Faltra City.

133
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,960
Do all of you have a moment to spare?

134
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,970
It's the first time the mirror 
has ever reacted that way.

135
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,680
Honestly, I don't think 
we can handle you here.

136
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,800
Huh?

137
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,180
What do you mean?

138
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,960
I'm certain you're high level,

139
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,680
but I have no idea how high.

140
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,490
Frankly, you're beyond our knowledge.

141
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,860
So even if you registered,

142
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,070
I wouldn't be able to decide what 
missions were acceptable for you.

143
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,470
So you won't accept me as an adventurer?

144
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,720
We're happy to register strong people.

145
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,880
But I'm weaker than you are.

146
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,380
Can you really accept being 
ordered around by me?

147
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,920
I don't care about such trivial details 
as long as you pay out the rewards.

148
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,670
You're an interesting guy.

149
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,950
All right. Glad to have you aboard, Diablo-san.

150
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,100
I-Indeed.

151
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:09,660
Though I imagine there aren't many quests 
that fit your actual abilities...

152
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,550
Hmm, this is a new quest.

153
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,110
What's the matter?

154
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,930
A few things.

155
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,220
This one smells fishy, but care to try it?

156
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,410
A quest to defeat a Madara Snake 
in the Man-Eating Woods?

157
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,040
They need the eyeballs of a Madara 
Snake for their experiments.

158
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,260
The client is the Mage's Association.

159
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,990
The Man-Eating Woods is where incredibly 
strong monsters show up, right?

160
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,740
Yes. Ordinarily, such a dangerous 
quest would never come down to us.

161
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,230
If someone requested it anyway, 
it must really be...

162
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,900
The Mage's Association?

163
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,930
Is that woman from yesterday involved?

164
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,530
Worry not.

165
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,540
You two can leave this one to me.

166
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,760
M-More importantly, we still 
have some distance to go, right?

167
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,310
It would be more convenient 
if we could use Teleport.

168
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,840
Is there no portal near the woods?

169
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,010
Portal?

170
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,220
What's "Teleport"?

171
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,570
A spell to return to the last town 
you visited is basic magic, isn't it?

172
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,750
Items that send you back should be 
easy to obtain, too, even early on.

173
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,240
If we had something like that,
everyone would use it!

174
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,490
I already hear enough
nonsense from the fat Elf.

175
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,600
That's mean! I'm not fat!

176
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,250
<i>That's another difference from the game.</i>

177
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,400
You are.

178
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,610
I'm not fat!

179
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,540
You <i>are</i>.

180
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,490
<i>Whatever.</i>

181
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,160
You're just jealous of them!

182
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,110
<i>Guess we'll keep walking.</i>

183
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,500
No, I'm not. Those things 
would just get in the way.

184
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,320
<i>Five hours spent traveling...</i>

185
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,500
<i>This game is total BS.</i>

186
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,090
Where do you think we can 
find a Madara Snake?

187
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:03,280
They're over twenty meters long,
and they usually lurk in the swamp,

188
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,120
where they attack prey that comes close.

189
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,270
Say that sooner!

190
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,870
<i>These woods are even creepier than 
they looked in the game's graphics.</i>

191
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,550
<i>There's no map displayed, either.</i>

192
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,280
<i>It'll be dangerous to walk around blindly.</i>

193
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,510
We're doing this quest 
all by ourselves, right?

194
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,290
Naturally.

195
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,700
Then do more people go in and out of 
the Man-Eating Woods than I thought?

196
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,580
Those who fear for their 
life don't go near it.

197
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,840
Why?

198
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,050
You can sense them, can't you? In the woods.

199
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,760
Is that true?

200
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,020
There are about ten people up in the branches.

201
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,430
They seem to be lying in wait for something.

202
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,520
Are you an idiot or a major idiot? I can't tell.

203
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,230
Why?!

204
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,710
So this is why Sylvie said it seemed fishy.

205
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,730
Huh? Huh?!

206
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,440
We've been caught in a trap.

207
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,520
They're going to ambush us.

208
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,070
What?!

209
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,520
Where are they?

210
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,660
There, there, and over there.

211
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,390
Burst Rain!

212
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,840
How's that?

213
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,340
Elemental Magic is...

214
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,680
capable of this?!

215
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,970
I didn't know your power was that great.

216
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,850
What is this?!

217
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,350
Elves?!

218
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,100
What's going on here?

219
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,710
That spell was suspicious!

220
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,730
Celsior?! Why are you here?!

221
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,360
Shera-sama!

222
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,110
I have hastened here to rescue you!

223
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,870
Slave trader, I'll have you 
return the noble princess

224
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,750
of the Kingdom of Greenwood, 
Shera L. Greenwood!

225
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,500
<i>Princess? Shera is?!</i>

226
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,050
<i>Right, Greenwood!</i>

227
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,750
<i>That's the name of the Elven royal family!</i>

228
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,020
<i>That was written somewhere 
in the game lore.</i>

229
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,360
Why would Elves submit a quest under 
the name of the Mage's Association?

230
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,640
I don't know who's tasked you 
with this, but I am no slave trader.

231
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,930
Silence!

232
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,250
That Enslavement Collar is irrefutable proof!

233
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,020
Release Shera-sama from her collar!

234
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:23,320
<i>Well, I can already think of 
someone in the Mage's Association</i>

235
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,430
<i>who holds a grudge against me.</i>

236
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,030
I don't care about the royal family!

237
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,410
Everyone in the royal family 
is worried about you!

238
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,720
What Nii-san needs isn't me, it's an heir!

239
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,680
He just wants me to bear his child!

240
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,420
That's a very important duty.

241
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,320
I don't even love him!

242
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,430
It's not right for me to be forced to 
marry someone when I don't even want to!

243
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,430
I refuse to return to our country!

244
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,430
I'll live on my own from now on!

245
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,690
But right now you're enslaved, aren't you?!

246
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,810
I'm not! I am no one's slave!

247
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,570
I belong to myself!

248
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,900
It sounds like your situation is complicated,

249
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,570
but you're too weak to live on your own.

250
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:14,140
We will bring you back, 
even if we must do so by force.

251
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,200
Well said.

252
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,080
That was impressive, for you.

253
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,040
It takes determination to abandon your country and live on your own.

254
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,090
I have to say I like that.

255
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,090
Rem...

256
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,430
Then we have no choice, everyone.

257
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,720
You buffoons.

258
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,600
What?!

259
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,170
You have made three mistakes.

260
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:39,960
First, I am no slave trader. I am a Sorcerer.

261
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,610
Second, Shera is not powerless.

262
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,870
After all, I'm lending her my aid right now.

263
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,740
Diablo...

264
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,990
And your third mistake was 
making an enemy of me!

265
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,450
Fire!

266
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,600
Diablo!

267
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,000
Wha?!

268
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,080
I thought you would be 
a bit better than this.

269
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:06,340
<i>This is like the graphic for the basic, 
ordinary arrows sold in shops.</i>

270
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,880
These arrows of yours will
be of no use in combat.

271
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,010
What do you even spend your time fighting?

272
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,990
Are you insulting us?!

273
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,970
I'm asking a question.

274
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,520
Are you not fighting monsters and Fallen?

275
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,820
O-Of course we aren't!

276
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,980
<i>Now I understand.</i>

277
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,400
<i>That's why this world's levels are so low.</i>

278
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,650
You monster!

279
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,160
Ah. Tempest Arrows, huh?

280
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,410
How do you know that?

281
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,820
<i>I've seen them many times in-game.</i>

282
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,790
If you use those, you might 
be able to damage me.

283
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,430
Of course!

284
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,920
These are prized treasures 
granted by His Highness!

285
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,520
They're supreme arrows that 
can penetrate anything!

286
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,510
They'll pierce right through
you and your vile nature!

287
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,160
Run!

288
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,180
Those arrows are bad!

289
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,180
Pierce him!

290
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,460
Diablo!

291
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,440
Wha?!

292
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,320
Diablo...

293
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,110
Thank goodness!

294
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,830
Wh-What are you?!

295
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,900
Keep that fear etched in 
your hearts along with this:

296
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:30,920
I am Diablo, the Demon Lord
from another world!

297
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,360
Freezia!

298
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,280
Hey!

299
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,560
Weren't you guys supposed
to be elite Elven troops?!

300
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,940
You're useless!

301
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,800
Hey.

302
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:10,940
So you were the one who put 
them up to this, plebeian?

303
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,560
No, I, um...

304
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,860
I just told them that the Elf 
princess had come here, that's all.

305
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:20,400
They seemed convinced I was 
a slave trader, though.

306
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,410
That was their own misunderstanding!

307
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,480
All demihumans are stupid!

308
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,550
Don't involve yourself with me again.

309
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,650
The next time you defy me, 
I'll eliminate you without mercy.

310
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,490
I wonder what Celes would have to say...

311
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,600
if she were to find out 
you borrowed the name

312
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,740
of the Mage's Association 
to lay a trap for us.

313
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,220
N-No...

314
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,750
I... I'm not in the wrong here!

315
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,750
Tell Nii-san something for me.

316
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,320
I'm never returning home.

317
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,810
I don't belong to him.

318
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:00,010
I'm staying with my companions,
Diablo and Rem, now.

319
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,620
Let's go home now!

320
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,250
I'm hungry!

321
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,520
Good grief. Since when did 
you and I become companions?

322
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,010
Huh? We're not?

323
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,780
But you just said you liked me earlier!

324
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,720
I only said your determination 
appealed to me.

325
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,440
Hey, are you blushing?

326
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,840
Are your cheeks red?

327
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,790
S-Stupid Shera!

328
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,080
<i>Me... A companion?</i>

329
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,760
Rem sure is late.

330
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,080
Yeah.

331
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,510
She went to tell Celes-san 
about what happened...

332
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,630
But she should be back by now.

333
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,600
Yeah.

334
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,020
<i>I can't keep a conversation going 
when I'm alone with a girl!</i>

335
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,070
Anyway, your magic is amazing, Diablo.

336
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,700
I've never seen anything like it.

337
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,600
There's one thing I've come 
to understand about leveling.

338
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:06,080
The people of this world live their 
lives as peacefully as possible,

339
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,060
trying to avoid death.

340
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,790
Isn't that normal?

341
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:13,700
<i>There are no salvation mechanisms 
or resets here, like in the game.</i>

342
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,050
<i>When you die, it's over.</i>

343
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,590
<i>Devoting time to leveling up 
in the face of such danger</i>

344
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,300
<i>is too risky for the average person.</i>

345
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:28,800
I come from a world where I prioritized 
leveling up as efficiently as possible,

346
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,630
even if it meant risking death.

347
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,310
You don't value your own life?

348
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,950
Of course, I never thought about 
throwing it away wastefully,

349
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:42,890
but I might not be able to defeat 
the Demon Lord Krebskulm otherwise.

350
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,150
Diablo, are you choosing Rem?

351
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,370
Rem's really focused on Krebskulm, you know?

352
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,710
Even though we don't know where 
or when she'll ever revive.

353
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,060
Yeah.

354
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:00,840
So if you're also thinking about 
defeating the Demon Lord Krebskulm...

355
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,720
Then you're really choosing Rem?

356
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,470
Hey!

357
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,850
I need you too, Diablo!

358
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:12,140
Even today, if it weren't for you,
I would've been taken back!

359
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,970
Oh, uh...

360
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,570
I was so happy today.

361
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:22,990
But if you choose Rem, then I'll...

362
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,110
Wait!

363
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,940
<i>N-No!</i>

364
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,240
Now, you listen up!

365
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,770
I am the Demon Lord!

366
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,380
Which is why I have no companions!

367
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,760
I-I haven't chosen Rem!

368
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,880
Really?

369
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,530
O-O-Of course!

370
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:48,760
Don't start thinking a Demon Lord 
will ever obey either of you!

371
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,730
Uh, and because I'm a Demon Lord...

372
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,740
I don't like this because it 
makes me feel weird, but...

373
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,260
<i>Feel weird?!</i>

374
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,300
It feels like I'm yearning for something!

375
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,240
Sorry.

376
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,450
Did it hurt?

377
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,080
No...

378
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,530
Diablo, do you like breasts, by chance?

379
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,040
You're always looking at mine...

380
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,790
<i>She's totally caught me!</i>

381
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,090
They're bigger than Rem's, aren't they?

382
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,660
Well, yeah...

383
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:30,870
<i>Wh-What's this suddenly erect, 
hard peak among the softness?!</i>

384
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,190
Hey, Diablo?

385
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,150
Wh-What?

386
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,680
Oh, it's Rem!

387
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,100
I already <i>know</i> mine are small!

388
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,680
You're going to release them both!

389
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,550
Right now, I feel like I can 
beat even a Demon Lord!

390
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:39,980
I must right this world!

391
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:39,980
