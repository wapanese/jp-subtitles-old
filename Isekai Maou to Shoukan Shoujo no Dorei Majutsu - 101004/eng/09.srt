1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:03,700
Help me!

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,880
Somebody help me!

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,990
How awful...

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,370
How can the mortal races be this awful?

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,080
The mortal races should just be wiped out.

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,210
So beautiful...

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,100
Everyone worshiping the Demon Lord 
in this village has found salvation.

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,360
What a beautiful sight.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,220
You truly can tell how much a person's 
worth by the color of their innards.

10
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,490
Episode Nine
Holy Knight Tale

11
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,490
Imperial Capital Sevenwall
Castle Grandiose

12
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,370
Alicia-sama?

13
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,130
You have returned?

14
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,250
Yes. It's good to see you again.

15
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,160
I see you're as busy as ever,

16
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,000
but please don't push yourself too hard.

17
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,470
It's an Imperial Knight's duty to 
devote themselves to the people.

18
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,350
P-Pardon me, then!

19
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,150
My, if it isn't Cristela-dono.

20
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,530
Have you finished reporting to 
His Majesty about the Greenwood incident?

21
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,410
Yes, without issue.

22
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,870
Though it's hard to predict what will 
come of the Kingdom of Greenwood,

23
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,670
His Majesty told me that matter is now closed.

24
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,060
That's good to hear.

25
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,540
Peace is best.

26
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,360
How about you, Saddler-sama?

27
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,050
I heard that you were headed 
to a village in the south.

28
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,510
Every last one of the 
villagers found salvation.

29
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,900
Saddler-sama...

30
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,220
Do you hate the mortal races?

31
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,440
Heavens, no!

32
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,520
I love them.

33
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,650
They're the descendants of 
those blessed by the Gods.

34
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,310
Which is precisely why

35
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,680
I cannot forgive those who 
worship the Demon Lord.

36
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:47,790
Pardon me.

37
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,650
Will you be heading back to Faltra?

38
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,180
There are still a few 
matters I must attend to.

39
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,350
Actually, I'll be heading to Faltra, as well.

40
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,610
The Head Priest, Lumachina-sama, 
revealed a prophecy.

41
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,460
A prophecy?

42
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,880
Yes. "There are omens of the Demon
Lord's revival in the western city."

43
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,270
I'm heading off to investigate 
that, as a Paladin.

44
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,270
Signs of the Demon Lord's revival?

45
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,930
Look, look! I summoned it!

46
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,590
Of course you did. You have me teaching you.

47
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,960
It's so cute!

48
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,300
This is a Turkey Shot.

49
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,520
To be blunt, it's not a strong Summon.

50
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,840
Huh? It's not?

51
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,490
Its special ability is Synchro Sight.

52
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,870
It's a power that allows you to 
see everything the Summon sees.

53
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,980
That's useful!

54
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,650
Using it consumes magic power, 
so you can't use it very long.

55
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,680
It might be useful when you're lost, but...

56
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,100
That's lame.

57
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,290
There are all kinds of Summons,

58
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,890
but ultimately, the ones that are tough and 
have powerful attacks are the strongest.

59
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,450
I see.

60
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,210
Well, how about it?

61
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,910
There isn't much need to perform the 
Enslavement Ritual with this one, but...

62
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,340
Since I summoned it, I'll forge the pact.

63
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,920
What's that?

64
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,350
I don't know, but it's necessary.

65
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,430
It's a magic stone needed to forge 
the pact in the Enslavement Ritual.

66
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,140
I'll give you one, too, Diablo.

67
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,640
<i>These weren't in </i>Cross Reverie<i>.</i>

68
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,750
I command you in the name 
of Shera L. Greenwood...

69
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,900
Answer my call, become mine, and obey me.

70
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,500
I did it!

71
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,420
I'm glad the magic wasn't reflected.

72
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,240
I don't want to be enslaved to a Turkey Shot!

73
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,190
About that Turkey Shot...

74
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,960
It might actually be an 
interesting match for you.

75
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,890
Huh?

76
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,620
There!

77
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,440
Well?

78
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,560
Can you see where the coin fell?

79
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,890
No...

80
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,740
Now, try sending your Summon out.

81
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,740
Uh, Turkey Shot, go find the coin.

82
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,210
Incredible!

83
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,710
I feel like I'm the one flying!

84
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,100
There it is!

85
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,090
Now shoot an arrow at it.

86
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:56,930
Sure!

87
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,980
I hit it!

88
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,650
Incredible!

89
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,440
As you can see, depending on how you use it,

90
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,520
you'll be able to shoot enemies in 
locations you can't see yourself.

91
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,530
I never knew it could be used like that.

92
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,420
That's impressive, Diablo!

93
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,120
<i>I just saw that on a guide site a while ago...</i>

94
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,050
Thanks, Diablo!

95
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,020
I thought I'd gotten stuck with a bad draw,

96
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,380
but now I really like it!

97
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,100
What's the matter?

98
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,400
It's not coming from the bird...

99
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,390
Shera?

100
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,170
Why don't you take a bath?

101
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,400
What do you mean?!

102
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,120
Well, you think so too, right, Diablo?

103
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,740
That Rem smells!

104
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,780
Huh?! What?!

105
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,440
If you don't cut it out,
I'm going to get angry!

106
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,370
Oh, in that case...

107
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,990
Let's all bathe together!

108
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,880
B-By "bathing"... you meant without swimsuits?!

109
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,740
What's a "swimsuit"?

110
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,880
For real?!

111
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,480
It's only natural to take off 
your clothes when bathing.

112
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,390
Even if you can see someone's body, 
it's proper manners not to look.

113
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,450
Come on, Diablo, hurry up 
and take yours off, too!

114
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,150
I don't care for this bathing activity of yours.

115
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,230
You two should get rid of 
the smell by yourselves.

116
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,400
I don't smell!

117
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,380
I can't believe you.

118
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,290
You really are a thoughtless person.

119
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,560
Pantherians' sweat doesn't smell, you know.

120
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,830
Really?

121
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,620
It doesn't smell, and it's not salty, either!

122
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,460
What are you doing?!

123
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,590
Lick, lick, lick!

124
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,590
Hey... No! Stop!

125
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,530
You're right. It isn't salty.

126
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,300
I told you it wasn't!

127
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,770
Want to try licking my sweat?

128
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,790
I'm not into that!

129
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,310
Then I'll lick it.

130
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,960
Stop that, you fat elf!

131
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,050
That's not fat!

132
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,970
Their jiggling is annoying!

133
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,840
You're not allowed to pinch the tips!

134
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,200
Hey! Where are you licking me?!

135
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,120
<i>I want to turn around!</i>

136
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,760
<i>I'm not brave enough to stare,</i>

137
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,360
<i>but I want to burn this scene into my eyes</i>

138
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,080
<i>and save it in my heart's 
important documents folder!</i>

139
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,690
<i>Maybe...</i>

140
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,860
<i>Just a little peek...</i>

141
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,590
I'm sorry!

142
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,620
Are you a Fallen?!

143
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,210
R-Rem?

144
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,470
You're Edelgard!

145
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,100
<i>She still hasn't learned her lesson?</i>

146
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,910
What have you come here for?!

147
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,390
I won't fight today.

148
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,110
I've come to talk.

149
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,890
Rem!

150
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,360
Talk?

151
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,900
A certain person informed me.

152
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,120
And now that I've touched her, I'm certain.

153
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,840
I sense the Demon Lord's soul.

154
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,130
<i>She's able to sense Demon Lord 
Krebskulm within Rem?</i>

155
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,560
What?

156
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,630
Rem, what's she talking about?

157
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,760
I don't like being the 
only one kept in the dark.

158
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,060
Please?

159
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,770
The...

160
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:33,660
The soul of Demon Lord Krebskulm
is sealed inside me.

161
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,400
Huh?

162
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,160
So that's what was going on.

163
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,910
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about it.

164
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:49,270
But I didn't want to make you bear 
the weight of this secret, as well.

165
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,800
Shera?

166
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,560
I may be weak...

167
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,860
But I want to help you 
when you're in trouble!

168
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,050
We're friends, after all!

169
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,600
It must have been tough 
for you all this time.

170
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,730
I'm sorry I didn't realize it.

171
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,430
Thank you... so much.

172
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,350
You want to defeat the Demon Lord.

173
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,130
Is that true?

174
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:18,940
It's true.

175
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,430
Hmm...

176
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,200
I have a question for you, as well.

177
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,940
I always thought I would be 
killed if a Fallen found out

178
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,580
where the Demon Lord's soul was...

179
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,550
The Demon Lord is... delicate?

180
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,810
You can't just break the vessel.
There's more missing.

181
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,910
So I won't kill you.

182
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,840
Do you know of a way to completely 
revive the Demon Lord?

183
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,970
I do.

184
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,510
Oh?

185
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,350
The resurrection ritual 
poses no risk to her life.

186
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,500
I won't kill her.

187
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,930
It's more like... she will be treasured

188
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,900
as the mother of the Demon Lord.

189
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,790
You don't believe what I've said.

190
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,400
Then I'll teach you the ritual.

191
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,780
You do it, and we Fallen won't touch you.

192
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,620
How's that?

193
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,500
<i>Rem wants to release the seal 
on the Demon Lord Krebskulm</i>

194
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,960
<i>and settle matters for good.</i>

195
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,130
<i>It's bad luck that Edelgard discovered us,</i>

196
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,680
<i>but our interests are the same as far as
wanting the Demon Lord's soul out of Rem.</i>

197
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,680
<i>The question is whether or not 
I can beat Krebskulm afterward.</i>

198
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,290
Diablo?

199
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,060
Hmph. Very well.

200
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,320
Teach me this ritual.

201
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,460
I'll help you revive this Demon Lord.

202
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,570
Then I'll turn around and pulverize
that Demon Lord impostor!

203
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,910
The Demon Lord is the real thing.

204
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,330
That would be impossible for you.

205
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,700
Have you forgotten my power?

206
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,590
I'll be waiting for you three days from now,

207
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,720
on the night of the full moon,
at Starfall Tower.

208
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,180
We'll conduct the ritual there.

209
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,060
Very well.

210
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,380
We've come to terms, Rem.

211
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,480
Now we'll be able to change 
this cursed fate of yours.

212
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,000
Three days from now,
I'll settle things for you.

213
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,750
Are you really going tonight?

214
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,520
Alicia-san!

215
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,390
Everyone, I have just returned 
from the imperial capital.

216
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,200
I'm glad to see you had a safe journey.

217
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,640
How did you know we'd be here?

218
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,890
We only entered this shop by chance.

219
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,270
Diablo-sama...

220
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,780
Please return to the inn at once.

221
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,590
Huh?

222
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,280
What's the meaning of this, Alicia?

223
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,080
Did something happen at the imperial capital?

224
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,170
A Paladin, Saddler, is here 
in this town right now.

225
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,450
Is that person dangerous?

226
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,150
I believe his level as a Knight is over 100.

227
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,060
Oh?

228
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,720
<i>If he's over 100, then he's 
on par with Galford or better.</i>

229
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,750
<i>Paladins never came after 
me for a battle in the game,</i>

230
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,620
<i>so I don't know their stats.</i>

231
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,410
Also...

232
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,200
If Saddler believes that you 
might be Demon Lord worshipers,

233
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,020
he'll put you through awful torture.

234
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,470
Torture?

235
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,330
Yes.

236
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,400
He'll drag it out until you confess
to worshiping the Demon Lord.

237
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,940
<i>Forget worshiper... I've proclaimed 
myself an actual Demon Lord!</i>

238
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,430
<i>We'll probably be on super bad terms!</i>

239
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,200
So I'd like to have you all remain 
indoors as much as possible

240
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,760
until Saddler leaves town.

241
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,790
<i>Shutting myself in is my forte!</i>

242
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:02,480
Still, I doubt Diablo would 
lose to that Paladin.

243
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,620
Of course, I'm well aware 
of Diablo-sama's abilities.

244
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,320
However, that man...

245
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,500
That man's true power is...

246
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,390
I've been looking for you, Cristela-dono.

247
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,060
I was wondering where you had gone off to.

248
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:29,770
I wanted to say hello to several 
adventurers I worked with before.

249
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,450
Is that so?

250
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,570
Nice to meet you.

251
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:37,580
I'm Saddler, a Paladin of the 
imperial capital's Orthodox Church.

252
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,580
Who might you be?

253
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,590
<i>We have an important mission tonight.</i>

254
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,270
<i>We don't have time to
provoke him into a fight.</i>

255
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,890
<i>I need to act normal and keep 
from saying anything I shouldn't.</i>

256
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,590
I am Diablo, a Demon Lord from another world!

257
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
<i>I acted too normal!</i>

258
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,670
I've heard there were many funny 
people among the rural adventurers,

259
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,980
but a Demon Lord?

260
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,150
That is priceless!

261
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,080
Diablo-sama truly loves to jest.

262
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,640
Even if it is a joke,

263
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,870
the fact that you're being friendly with
someone calling himself a Demon Lord

264
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,940
is a problem I can't overlook.

265
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,920
These are adventurers who helped me.

266
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,250
There's nothing about them to be ashamed of.

267
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,710
You say they have nothing to hide?

268
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:33,560
Are you planning to torture me?

269
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,220
I don't know.

270
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,890
This makes no sense.

271
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,020
Do you have a problem with us 
seeing Alicia Cristela-dono?

272
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,780
Know your place, slave.

273
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,030
I am no slave!

274
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,160
If you're too rude,
you'll face divine judgment.

275
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,800
You should be apologizing
for your rudeness yourself.

276
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,080
Alicia-dono's...

277
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,540
Rem?

278
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,800
Rem?!

279
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,600
Rem-sama!

280
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,060
Rem!

281
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,950
That was the work of the Gods.

282
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:15,550
It's a power the Gods granted 
me because of my faith.

283
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,180
Rem! Hang in there, Rem!

284
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,560
<i>What's this? What's going on?</i>

285
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,260
<i>There were no works of the Gods in the game!</i>

286
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,540
<i>What am I supposed to do?!</i>

287
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,140
<i>No...</i>

288
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,360
<i>That thing wrapped around Rem...</i>

289
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,300
<i>That's...</i>

290
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,820
<i>magic power?!</i>

291
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,040
That's quite the stupid stunt 
you've pulled, small fry!

292
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,700
Small fry?

293
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,830
You call this divine punishment?

294
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,600
It's just a simple spell!

295
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,520
Rem!

296
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,720
Rem-sama?!

297
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,340
You, a mere Demon, would insult a Paladin?

298
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,110
Rem-sama! Please hang in there!

299
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,590
Alicia-san...

300
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,340
Thank goodness.

301
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,730
You question the power of the Gods?

302
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,100
Then you can pay through 
divine punishment, as well.

303
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,860
You're still claiming that?

304
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,110
Stupid magic like that won't work on me.

305
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,800
You foolish unbeliever!

306
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,610
You can repent as a stone!

307
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,180
Wh-What?!

308
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,020
Hmph. Cement Lock, huh?

309
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,870
That's a negative status Earth spell.

310
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,910
This is Magic Reflection?

311
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,460
It truly was a spell, then.

312
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,560
Most likely, it was cast using Subtle Chant.

313
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,830
It's a skill you can learn

314
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,540
after reaching level 60 as a Sorcerer.

315
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,510
It lets you use magic without 
speaking the spell's name.

316
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,480
Will the Petrification wear off?

317
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,560
It depends on the caster's level,

318
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,260
but eventually the magic power 
will dissipate, and he'll be free.

319
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,920
Are you all right, Rem?

320
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,270
Yes.

321
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,730
You saved me again, though.

322
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:32,080
Are you truly sure it was 
okay to let Saddler go?

323
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,580
Are you saying it would 
have been better to kill him?

324
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,310
<i>Huh? Seriously?</i>

325
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,920
I have no interest in whether 
small fry live or die.

326
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,560
If he challenges me again, 
I won't show mercy on him.

327
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,690
You're right.

328
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,710
I guess I was worried over nothing.

329
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,470
It's almost time.

330
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,360
Yes.

331
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,230
Let's go to Starfall Tower.

332
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,910
What's the matter?

333
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,490
Maybe we ought to tell her.

334
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,870
Tell Alicia?

335
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,460
I think that's okay.

336
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,420
Alicia-san's a nice person,

337
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,870
so I'm sure she'll understand.

338
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,880
I'm against it.

339
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,160
Alicia is an Imperial Knight.

340
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,630
Given her position, she wouldn't 
overlook the Demon Lord's revival.

341
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,140
I understand that, but...

342
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,890
Even so, I want to trust Alicia-san.

343
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:00,150
She's my friend now, just like you and Shera.

344
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,090
I see...

345
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,150
You must have suffered a long time.

346
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,660
It must have been hard
for you confess this to me.

347
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,520
I'll help you as much as I can.

348
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,960
So there's no need to bear 
this burden all by yourself.

349
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,550
We're friends, after all.

350
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,300
Thank you, Alicia-san.

351
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,310
<i>This feels kind of cheap.</i>

352
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,720
<i>Something's not right.</i>

353
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,050
<i>What is this uneasy feeling in my chest?</i>

354
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,230
<i>No, no!</i>

355
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,370
<i>My poor communication skills 
and lack of friends</i>

356
