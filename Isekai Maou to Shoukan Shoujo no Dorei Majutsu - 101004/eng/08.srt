1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,780
Simply wonderful!

2
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,290
Just as one would expect from a Summon

3
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,020
whose use is forbidden because 
it will destroy the world!

4
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,790
<i></i>Cross Reverie<i> never had 
a Summon like this...</i>

5
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,300
Run, Diablo!

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,860
That Summon has been in the royal family 
for generations! It's a guardian deity!

7
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,430
You'll never defeat it!

8
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,040
How interesting.

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,280
All of you, stand back.

10
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,760
I'm going to crush that thing!

11
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,500
Episode Eight
Hero's Charge

12
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,880
Get him, Force Hydra!

13
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,470
Kill him!

14
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,860
Well, you don't have any control 
over it at all, do you?

15
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,770
<i>Neither this powerful Summon</i>

16
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,570
<i>nor the flute that manipulated 
Shera were in the game.</i>

17
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,340
<i>It's possible that every planned element of
</i>Cross Reverie<i> is already part of this world.</i>

18
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,570
<i>That's an exciting thought!</i>

19
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,210
That's...

20
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,030
You idiot!

21
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,290
There's no way you can win!

22
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,210
Just disappear, you Demon!

23
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,840
<i>Looks like his confidence
in this Summon is absolute.</i>

24
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,530
Heaven's Fall!

25
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,560
<i>It's weaker than I thought.</i>

26
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,520
<i>It should go down in 
another four or five shots.</i>

27
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,310
<i>Regeneration?!</i>

28
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,330
<i>That's way too fast! Is this a bug?!</i>

29
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,780
Diablo!

30
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,590
That's it, Force Hydra!

31
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,460
Did you see that, Demon?!

32
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,500
<i>Dragon's Breath is a purely 
elemental attack.</i>

33
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,260
<i>Magic Reflection and physical damage 
reduction won't activate against it.</i>

34
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,940
<i>What worries me is its skills.</i>

35
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,770
<i>Summons are supposed to be 
limited to a single skill.</i>

36
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,780
<i>Yet this one seems to have two skills?</i>

37
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,530
<i>Ice, Sand, Wind, and Fire?!</i>

38
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,080
<i>That's too many attack skills!</i>

39
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,270
<i>Are you saying this world is 
nothing more than another world</i>

40
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,460
<i>that just resembles </i>Cross Reverie<i>?!</i>

41
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,840
Yes, yes! This is my power!

42
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:47,220
I don't need anyone who'll get 
in my way or drag me down!

43
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,820
<i>There must be something...</i>

44
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,800
<i>What's its weakness?</i>

45
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,280
Diablo!

46
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,780
I've heard that the Force Hydra possesses 
a core somewhere in its body,

47
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,940
and destroying that returns it to its crystal!

48
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,170
<i>So that's what it is?</i>

49
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,550
How does an idiot like you know about that?

50
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,040
Still, its core moves 
around within its body.

51
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,350
It won't be that easy for you to find!

52
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,420
Moving weak points are classic.

53
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,060
What?

54
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,020
I never planned to search for it at all!

55
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,610
Matoi Izuna!

56
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,690
Wh-What is this?!

57
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,480
I don't understand!

58
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,740
Way to go, Diablo!

59
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,490
I can't believe you beat
a Summon that powerful.

60
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,460
What the hell are you?!

61
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,240
I am Diablo.

62
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,200
A chaotic Demon Lord from another 
world that no one can control.

63
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,790
Don't be ridiculous!

64
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,220
There's no way you're a Demon Lord!

65
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,540
You need to be punished.

66
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,600
Pay for your many mistakes with your death!

67
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,690
I'll end this in an instant.

68
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,560
Burst, Explosâ€”

69
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,190
Wait! Spare him!

70
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,150
Shera?!

71
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,820
You're not still under his control, are you?

72
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,660
No, I'm not.

73
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,360
I still hate Nii-san.

74
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,580
I loathe him.

75
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,820
But he's still family.

76
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,090
We still laughed together.

77
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,060
Tch!

78
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,020
Are you sure, Shera?

79
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,970
Yes. Thank you, Diablo.

80
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,520
And sorry.

81
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,240
It's not good for us if you 
just decide to spare him.

82
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,990
Shera...

83
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,960
Keera-sama!

84
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,620
Galford?

85
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,770
What do you think you're doing?

86
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,420
How dare you?!

87
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,780
This is war.

88
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,090
The war started the moment that Elf prince

89
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,790
sent his troops into another 
nation's territory.

90
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,070
He has no right to complain 
about being killed.

91
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,240
Exterminate the Elven troops 
scattered in the forest!

92
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,890
Capture the princess!

93
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,300
You may eliminate any who interfere!

94
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,550
Were you planning to do this all along?!

95
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,810
Were you plotting to make me fight the Elves

96
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,350
so you would have a justification 
for seizing Greenwood?!

97
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,900
If you intend to interfere, 
I'll need to eliminate you, too.

98
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,730
What's this?!

99
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,990
<i>This is a spell I don't know.</i>

100
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,920
<i>It's been nothing but 
things like this all day!</i>

101
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:31,040
It's Ritual Magic designed 
to capture large monsters.

102
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,800
Even you won't be able to escape that easily.

103
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,130
Galford,

104
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,600
what is the meaning of this?

105
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,080
Please explain yourself.

106
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,010
I'm performing my duties as Lord of Faltra.

107
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,990
I'm crushing invaders and 
protecting the people.

108
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,810
But you're going to kill 
people who surrendered!

109
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,080
Am I?

110
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,820
It certainly doesn't look 
like they've surrendered.

111
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,100
Do you, a lone Imperial Knight,
mean to question my military judgment?

112
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,740
I'm going to stop you.

113
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:04,240
How do you plan to stop me 
when your sword has no blade?

114
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,550
What just happened?

115
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,780
<i>He's fast!</i>

116
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,400
<i>Those movements were on a 
completely different level</i>

117
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,300
<i>from other soldiers and adventurers!</i>

118
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,060
<i>He's surpassed Human limits!</i>

119
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,350
<i>He's definitely above level 100!</i>

120
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,940
You can return to the imperial 
capital and give your report.

121
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,440
But I believe His Majesty will 
listen to the stronger person.

122
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,760
<i>At this rate, it won't just be Shera.</i>

123
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,460
<i>Rem and Alicia are in danger, too.</i>

124
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,040
<i>Feel it. Sense the flow of magic power...</i>

125
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,660
<i>Don't panic.</i>

126
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,500
<i>This is nothing compared 
to the Enslavement Collars.</i>

127
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,260
<i>Where's the magic power centered?</i>

128
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,440
Begin the operation.

129
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,530
Capture the princess and 
eliminate those who interfere!

130
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,270
Yes, sir!

131
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,480
<i>I see it now!</i>

132
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,640
<i>That's the center of the magic power!</i>

133
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,610
<i>Hurry!</i>

134
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,900
I'm surprised.

135
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,620
You unraveled the barrier?

136
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,500
Diablo...

137
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,940
Stand back.

138
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,160
I suppose I should have dealt with you first.

139
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,510
You were planning an Invasion after 
I wore myself down fighting the Elves

140
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,270
right from the start, weren't you?

141
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,860
That's called strategy.

142
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,120
Though I doubt an adventurer 
would understand.

143
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,770
Hmph. I don't want to understand it.

144
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,780
Insults from an opponent 
are praise to a soldier.

145
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:03,280
I'll make you face such despair that 
you won't even be able to insult me!

146
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,060
Explosion!

147
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,180
<i>I need distance!</i>

148
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:27,600
<i>This guy...</i>

149
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:32,100
<i>He has the basic idea of never giving 
a Sorcerer an opening down pat!</i>

150
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,110
It looks like you're considerably worn down.

151
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,110
Your movements are rather slow for a Sorcerer

152
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,610
who turned back an army 
of Fallen, aren't they?

153
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,580
Hmph. I just can't get motivated 
because you're too weak!

154
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,290
What?!

155
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,610
There's nothing wasted.

156
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,920
But that only makes your movements 
easier to read, Galford.

157
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,300
So you laid a trap for me?

158
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,900
<i>Super Mine.</i>

159
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,430
<i>It's a spell planted in the ground that 
explodes when one passes over it.</i>

160
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:14,060
It's been thirty years since 
anyone wounded me, Diablo.

161
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,390
Is that so?

162
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:19,440
The fact that you've never faced 
better opponents is why you'll lose.

163
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,090
<i>He made the call to keep me from 
reading his path. That's impressive.</i>

164
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:27,700
<i>However!</i>

165
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,910
<i>The steps used to close in on a Sorcerer,</i>

166
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,250
<i>the spells used to prevent that...</i>

167
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,620
<i>He has no idea</i>

168
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,500
<i>how much time I've poured 
into researching those alone!</i>

169
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,320
<i>That's the world I've come from, Galford!</i>

170
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,710
<i>The man standing before you is one 
who's buried countless challengers,</i>

171
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,130
<i>the Demon Lord Diablo!</i>

172
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,220
<i>A slight opening!</i>

173
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,640
Freeze Zone!

174
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,650
<i>It's over, Galford!</i>

175
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,640
<i>What?!</i>

176
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,780
<i>Oh, no! I can't move because of my skill's recoil!</i>

177
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:13,540
<i>He created an opening on purpose 
to draw a big move out of me!</i>

178
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,290
You're not bad, Galford!

179
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,990
Omit.

180
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,560
Lightning Bullet.

181
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,910
<i>That was close...</i>

182
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,640
<i>I didn't think Galford was capable of 
using absolute defense Martial Arts</i>

183
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,320
<i>that offer a perfect 
defense against attacks.</i>

184
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,800
<i>That last skill he used was Heat Sonic, 
which is learned at level 120.</i>

185
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,820
<i>He's the most powerful opponent I've 
faced since coming to this world.</i>

186
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,700
So where's the killing blow?

187
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,710
I'm still alive here.

188
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,050
<i>Is this old guy serious?</i>

189
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,770
<i>If he thinks it was a close match, 
he might come after me again.</i>

190
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,760
<i>I don't want him getting fixated on me.</i>

191
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,850
<i>I guess I should intimidate him a bit.</i>

192
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,670
You're so weak, I've lost interest!

193
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,110
Know that someone like you 
will never be a match for me!

194
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,450
So you won't kill me?

195
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,480
It looked like you risked it all to strike 
while I was frozen after a huge move.

196
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,170
Too bad it didn't work.

197
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,120
If I were a normal opponent, 
you might have won.

198
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:42,000
But if you're too weak to realize that 
I factored that pause into my distance,

199
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,370
then you're no threat to 
me even if left alive.

200
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,100
I could still give a report 
to His Royal Majesty

201
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,880
that would be disadvantageous to you.

202
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,860
Huh?

203
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,260
I will not allow that to happen!

204
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,240
Galford-sama, I'll report that you took 
action with the intent of destroying

205
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,020
our peace with the surrounding nations.

206
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,810
I still think killing me would
be much more certain.

207
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:07,790
Enough!

208
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,790
If you want to die, do it on your own.

209
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,830
If you want to challenge me again,
I'll take you on at any time.

210
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:17,680
But if you move against me
or my possessions again,

211
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,290
know that I'll reduce both 
you and your land to ashes!

212
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,800
All units, withdraw!

213
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,850
I can't believe you beat Galford.

214
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,300
You really are incredible.

215
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,990
Of course.

216
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,800
So, um, do you have any 
spare healing potions?

217
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,820
Are you injured?

218
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,760
No, it's not for me.

219
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,070
I wanted to use them on the wounded Elves.

220
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,330
Oh. Here.

221
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,460
You really are kind.

222
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,170
Fool!

223
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,440
Keep spouting nonsense, and I'll 
blast away this whole forest!

224
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,590
I can't let the forest be wiped out,
so I'll go heal the Elves.

225
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,690
Jeez.

226
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,010
Diablo...

227
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,740
Please take care of Shera.

228
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,640
It had to happen, right?

229
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,770
I don't understand international 
matters that well,

230
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,570
but Nii-san did something bad, after all.

231
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,600
I hated Nii-san, but...

232
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,240
But...

233
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,930
I never thought we would part like this.

234
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,170
<i>Three days have passed since we stopped 
the war between the Elves and Faltra.</i>

235
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,160
<i>Time passes on as usual 
for everyone in the city,</i>

236
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,420
<i>unaware that such danger 
had drawn close to them.</i>

237
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,240
<i>Shera was silent for a long while,</i>

238
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,030
<i>but thanks to Rem, she's slowly 
regaining her energy.</i>

239
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,760
<i>Shortly after that was over,</i>

240
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,480
<i>Alicia headed to the imperial 
capital to report the events</i>

241
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,040
<i>to the emperor.</i>

242
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,830
<i>As for Greenwood,</i>

243
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,940
<i>Celsior is taking the initiative 
to explain matters.</i>

244
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,080
<i>As for me...</i>

245
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,580
<i>I'm as unmotivated as ever.</i>

246
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,320
<i>When my Magic Points are near zero,</i>

247
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,210
<i>I can't find the drive to do anything.</i>

248
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,450
<i>It would be fine if I were just 
unmotivated, but we're broke, too.</i>

249
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:06,950
<i>Damn that Galford...</i>

250
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,750
<i>I know we cleared the quest 
to prevent war with the Elves,</i>

251
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,960
<i>but since he was our client, 
and I beat him up,</i>

252
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,630
<i>our reward was left unsettled.</i>

253
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,130
<i>I'll kill that Galford!</i>

254
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,620
Yes?

255
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,640
Good afternoon, Diablo-san.

256
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,390
Sylvie?

257
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,180
I heard you weren't feeling well,

258
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,240
so I brought you something nice.

259
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,840
An MP Potion?

260
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,270
Well, something similar.

261
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:39,240
It's an alcoholic spirit that has the
side effect of recovering Magic Points.

262
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,030
Such a thing exists?

263
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,910
It's not very effective, 
so you can get it for cheap.

264
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,910
Above all, it tastes better than potions!

265
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,500
Well, care for a drink?

266
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,190
Cheers!

267
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,040
Yeah.

268
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,070
<i>Alcohol...</i>

269
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,540
<i>Alcohol, huh?</i>

270
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,260
<i>I'm not that big a drinker...</i>

271
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,300
Not drinking any?

272
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,550
Oh, uh...

273
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,280
<i>Well...</i>

274
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,620
<i>I guess Diablo's body is sturdy,</i>

275
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,310
<i>and there wasn't any "Drunk"
status effect in </i>Cross Reverie<i>...</i>

276
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,060
<i>So it should be fine.</i>

277
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,590
Diablo-san, you must hold 
your liquor really well!

278
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,820
Of 'ourse I do.

279
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,320
'Ourse?

280
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,430
This's nothin'.

281
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,870
I'm a Demon Lord, af'er all!

282
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,860
Diablo... san?

283
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,380
Oh, a hug pfhillow, huh?

284
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,900
This'un's made with th' nices' fabric...

285
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,240
Diablo-san?!

286
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,430
This is... not something I should be doing...

287
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,770
This'd be worth goin' into debt for.

288
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,560
Hey, stop!

289
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,620
Sumthin's pokin' me, though...

290
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,690
Y-You can't take that off!

291
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,990
If you go any further than this, I'll be mad!

292
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,340
Mmm, so smooth.

293
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,870
How did this happen?

294
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,170
No!

295
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,740
Not there!

296
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,130
Don't do that there!

297
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,340
That's...

298
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:40,460
Jeez, Diablo-san...

299
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,080
You'd better take responsibility for this...

300
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,900
Diablo-san?

301
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,800
Jeez! At least let go of me 
before you fall asleep!

302
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,960
Rem-san and Shera-chan are 
going to come back to this!

303
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,120
Give me my clothes back!

304
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,130
Come on!

305
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,340
I sense the Demon Lord's soul.

306
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,360
That man...

307
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,360
That's man's true power...

308
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,930
You really can tell how much someone's 
worth by the color of their innards.

309
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,930
