1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,350
The Demon Lord has been resurrected!

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,760
Wonderful!

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,720
Krebskulm-sama has resurrected 
as a true Demon Lord!

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,440
A mortal? Why are they here?

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,560
She's the one who developed today's plan.

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,790
What?

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,670
Welcome back, Alicia.

8
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,670
As planned,

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,120
I made someone special to Krebskulm-sama,

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,800
then arranged for their destruction.

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,160
Such a difficult task...

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,380
Amazing.

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,470
Soon the mortal races will perish.

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,190
We'll finally end this ugly world.

15
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,950
<i>I won't let the barrier be broken!</i>

16
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,400
A horde of Fallen to the west,

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,560
and the Demon Lord to the north...

18
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,960
Galford-san.

19
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,710
So this is where you were.

20
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,390
We're at war now.

21
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,120
There's no place for adventurers here.

22
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,300
Just listen to me, okay?

23
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,370
I want you to leave the magic 
circle in the north to us.

24
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:21,970
What?

25
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,200
Diablo-san's already heading there.

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,600
I want you to hold off from 
interfering and getting in his way.

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,980
That adventurer?

28
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,930
Klem!

29
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,490
Final Episode
Battle for Legitimacy

30
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,900
Do you recognize me?

31
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,940
She's lost her sense of reason?

32
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,130
If she's forgotten who I am, 
then I'll force her to remember!

33
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,930
<i>I'm going to save both you and Rem!</i>

34
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,600
Rem!

35
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,070
<i>It's not too hard to dodge, 
but her power's incredible.</i>

36
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,620
<i>What I should do is get farther away 
and activate my powerful spells,</i>

37
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,000
<i>but the outer walls and the 
barrier tower are too close.</i>

38
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,180
<i>If I want to protect the city,</i>

39
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,700
<i>I have to restrain my area of effect!</i>

40
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,720
<i>Eleven more...</i>

41
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,970
Volcanic Wall!

42
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,580
That was close! Is that Darkness Breath?!

43
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,180
Magic Reflection.

44
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,990
I know I showed it to you 
in the fight with Eulerex.

45
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,000
Her magic defense is way too high!

46
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,760
Rem!

47
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,890
You're finally free now!

48
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,340
You can't die here like this, Rem!

49
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,170
Please, answer me!

50
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,410
Gods, please don't take Rem away.

51
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,320
Shera?

52
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,720
Rem!

53
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,930
Ow, ow! Stupid Shera!

54
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,980
Sorry!

55
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,840
But I'm so glad.

56
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,700
How did this all happen?

57
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,070
Alicia betrayed us.

58
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,040
She wanted the Demon Lord to 
be resurrected from the start.

59
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,090
Th-That would mean...

60
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,720
She was a Demon Lord worshiper.

61
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,410
She forced Klem to endure something very sad.

62
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:12,270
Being overwhelmed by hatred was probably 
the key to the Demon Lord's awakening.

63
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,160
That's awful.

64
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:16,770
What are those?

65
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,990
Diablo gave them to me.

66
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,400
He said to use them on you

67
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,230
and gave me all he had on him.

68
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,660
Then Diablo's fighting the Demon 
Lord without any way to recover?

69
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,780
<i>Six left.</i>

70
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,420
<i>Is this even possible?!</i>

71
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,750
<i>If I wasn't Level 150,</i>

72
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,260
<i>I'd be dead right now!</i>

73
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,260
<i>Oh, I gave away all my potions, didn't I?</i>

74
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,810
<i>Back when I played solo,</i>

75
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,150
<i>I never used my items on other people, and 
I definitely never ran out of them doing it!</i>

76
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,840
Look out!

77
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,440
Emile?!

78
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,390
Anything goes here, doesn't it?!

79
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,740
But that's thirteen spots now!

80
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,820
Friend!

81
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,090
Emile?

82
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,810
I took Rem-chan and Shera-chan outside!

83
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,690
Get her!

84
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,440
That's good work, for you.

85
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,690
As a reward, I'll demonstrate my Grand Magic!

86
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,570
I had a hard time fighting while 
keeping her within its effective range.

87
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,870
Now, this blow should wake you up, Klem!

88
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,350
Apocalypse Abyss!

89
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,620
Get over here!

90
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,240
You're kidding me!

91
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,500
It's still alive after that blow?!

92
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,760
You still want to fight?

93
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,460
Klem!

94
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,510
Klem!

95
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,340
Klem!

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,100
Klem!

97
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,720
Klem, I'm okay.

98
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,310
Please come back to us!

99
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,800
Let's eat biscuits together again.

100
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,320
It must have hurt so much...

101
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,580
But it's okay now.

102
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,330
Let's go home, Klem.

103
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,850
It's over, then?

104
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,910
You're... alive?

105
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,000
Welcome back, Klem.

106
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,360
I need to apologize to you.

107
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,740
I broke my promise.

108
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,750
When I thought they had killed you,
my whole mind went red.

109
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,190
It doesn't matter now.

110
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,090
No matter who disapproves,
I'll be on your side.

111
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,580
That monster turned into a little girl?

112
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,850
Look, Emile, this whole thing...

113
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,390
Worry not.

114
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,550
I'm an ally of all women.

115
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,110
I don't know what's going on, but I'd never 
do anything to make those girls cry.

116
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,420
I forgot you were that kind of man.

117
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,790
Hey, are you all right?

118
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,370
Yeah.

119
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,800
<i>I can't let them see a Demon Lord
 on the verge of collapsing!</i>

120
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,960
The presence of the Demon 
Lord has grown smaller?

121
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,630
Why?

122
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,390
What's the meaning of this?

123
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,300
Edelgard, this is the 
second time you've failed.

124
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,640
Not only did you ally yourself with a Human,

125
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,000
but you've wasted the 
time of countless Fallen.

126
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,720
You will take responsibility for this!

127
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,550
When I give the signal,

128
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,650
run for the city.

129
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,780
Hey, Diablo-san, nice work out there!

130
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,270
It's thanks to the information I got 
from the Adventurer's Guild.

131
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,150
Be proud that you proved useful to me.

132
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,670
I'm glad you protected our city, too.

133
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:34,380
By the way, I'd like to ask this 
while the graveyard is sealed off...

134
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,550
That girl is Demon Lord Krebskulm, isn't she?

135
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,920
Sorry, but I can't just 
let her run around free.

136
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,410
I have to protect the 
safety of the mortal races

137
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,940
as the master of the Adventurer's Guild.

138
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,440
Are you saying you'll fight me?

139
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,270
I trust you, Diablo-san,

140
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,820
but I can't trust the Demon Lord Krebskulm.

141
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,610
Please! This girl is...

142
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,450
If Diablo-san wasn't here,

143
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,580
this entire city would've 
been destroyed by Krebskulm.

144
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,500
Did you know that a huge army of Fallen 
was approaching us from the west?

145
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,460
I didn't summon them here!

146
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,710
We don't know that.

147
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,360
<i>What do I do?</i>

148
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,470
<i>Sylvie's not wrong, but...</i>

149
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,020
Klem.

150
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:33,260
Would you like to live in 
this city with Rem and Shera?

151
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,890
Yeah.

152
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,010
Then let me tell you something.

153
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,560
There's a way for you to eat 
biscuits here in this city

154
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,650
without adventurers coming after your life.

155
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,170
I don't think there's a way to—

156
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,120
That's...

157
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,810
A magic stone of a pact?

158
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,580
Klem, I can cast the 
Enslavement Spell on you

159
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,840
and make you my servant!

160
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,090
What?!

161
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,270
Make me your servant?

162
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,400
Oh, right!

163
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,020
We have that option!

164
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,960
Once I do that, you'll belong to me.

165
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,970
You said you trust me, right?

166
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,730
Well, I do, but... What?!

167
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,190
Enslave me?

168
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,770
It's okay!

169
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:19,960
Both Rem and I are Diablo's slaves,
but it's really nothing!

170
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,870
Still, wouldn't being a slave 
mean I'm not free anymore?

171
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,700
Diablo's not like that.

172
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,620
I guarantee it.

173
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,840
Very well. I permit it!

174
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,130
You may use your 
Enslavement Spell or whatever!

175
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,380
Wha?! Wha?! <i>Wha?!</i>

176
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,720
I command you in the name 
of the Demon Lord Diablo.

177
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:50,410
Heed my call, surrender to me, and obey me.

178
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,920
The Demon Lord hasn't resurrected, 
and the Fallen have withdrawn.

179
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,700
Is this thanks to that Demon?

180
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,450
Yeah.

181
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:14,400
Is there anything you 
need to discuss with me?

182
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,560
Hmm, is there?

183
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,990
I figure you already know.

184
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,480
You have such a splendid 
information network, after all.

185
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,580
We'll just have to watch over 
them quietly for a while.

186
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,220
Of course, we can't let 
our guard down, though.

187
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,810
Later, Galford-san.

188
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,980
To think we'd be saved by that Demon...

189
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,070
Huh?

190
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,420
Why are you scowling again, Diablo?

191
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,330
Because I've peered into an abyss that 
the likes of you couldn't imagine.

192
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,200
That sounds awesome!

193
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,600
What's an abyss?

194
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,580
<i>The abyss!</i>

195
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:00,090
An "abyss" can be a metaphor for 
something deep and endless.

196
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,320
Diablo's exhausted.

197
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,010
Just leave him be, and let him rest.

198
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:09,760
You may say that, but you're 
planning to sleep with him, too!

199
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,150
It's fine if I do.

200
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,350
What?!

201
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,100
Come on over here, Klem-chan.

202
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,230
Really? I can join you, too?

203
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,350
Why not?

204
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,700
I killed mortals, remember?

205
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,720
I even tried to kill you all!

206
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,800
Don't you think I'm dangerous?

207
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,880
Sylvie-san's the only one 
who thinks you're dangerous.

208
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,330
But...

209
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,870
Don't make me laugh.

210
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,360
You tried to kill me?

211
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,870
Those weak attacks wouldn't work on me.

212
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,520
After all, I'm the true Demon Lord.

213
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,930
I see!

214
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,560
<i>In truth, I'm more nervous 
about sleeping with them</i>

215
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,830
<i>than I am about fighting a Demon Lord.</i>

216
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,930
<i>I still can't get used to it.</i>

217
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,600
Oh, the light!

218
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,880
I'll turn it off.

219
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,600
Rem, get that one.

220
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,040
Now, we sleep!

221
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,700
Alicia?!

222
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,900
Rem-sama? You're still alive?!

223
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,780
How dare you appear before me again?

224
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,580
Unhand Shera so I can rip you to shreds.

225
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,590
I'll release Shera-sama once 
my business here is done.

226
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:26,050
Please rip me to shreds or 
whatever you want then.

227
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,230
Oh?

228
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:31,800
I've heard the Demon Lord is able 
to heal the wounds of Fallen.

229
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,220
Of course I can.

230
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,730
Then could you come with me, please?

231
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,280
Edelgard!

232
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,560
The other Fallen punished her

233
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,120
after our plan to resurrect Krebskulm-sama

234
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,120
and exterminate the mortal races failed.

235
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,990
I see...

236
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,360
When we met up with Edelgard 
at Starfall Tower,

237
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,130
she never asked who you were 
after you suddenly showed up.

238
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,050
So you two were working 
together from the beginning?

239
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,820
You are correct.

240
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,510
Please!

241
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,810
Please, save Edelgard-sama!

242
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:18,230
Do you think I'd listen to 
someone who put Rem in danger?

243
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,280
Diablo, what do you think?

244
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,860
Help her.

245
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,730
Very well.

246
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,900
In an instant?!

247
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,710
Demon Lord?!

248
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,700
Yes.

249
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,090
Demon Lord!

250
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,100
I'm overcome with gratitude!

251
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,790
Demon Lord...

252
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,440
Why have you returned to your original form?

253
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,760
Because the people here with me risked 
their lives to restore me to normal.

254
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,030
They did?

255
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,520
Are you dissatisfied?

256
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,990
I don't know.

257
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,140
Fallen are meant to kill mortals.

258
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,390
We're supposed to be enemies, so why?

259
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,620
I don't know, either.

260
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,010
That's why I've decided 
to live in the human city.

261
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,800
There are biscuits here, too.

262
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,240
So stop doing such sad things already.

263
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,930
If you can't obey that order,
 then you're no longer my follower.

264
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,450
I swear, I will not do such things anymore.

265
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,080
Thank you very much.

266
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,300
You may do with me as you wish now.

267
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,550
How did an Imperial Knight like you

268
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,370
become a Demon Lord worshiper?

269
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,630
Have you never wished humanity would perish?

270
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,920
Have you never shouted in your mind,

271
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,310
"I'll kill you, you bastard"?

272
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,400
<i>All the time!</i>

273
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,570
Maybe not to that extent, but of 
course I've gotten angry at others.

274
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,600
What happened to you?

275
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,080
Perhaps I might have been 
able to compartmentalize it

276
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,200
if there had been a specific incident.

277
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,660
I think I was just exposed 
to too much of the dark side

278
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,670
of self-centered, greedy, 
powerful, and entitled people

279
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,570
who pretended they were good people.

280
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,470
My parents, the other Imperial Knights,

281
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,090
nobles, and even the emperor 
were all the same.

282
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,520
They forced their own nonsensical 
righteousness on us all.

283
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,350
It was so ugly that I couldn't accept it.

284
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,260
I believed there was no 
place for me in this world,

285
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,980
as I lived on alone with
 only hatred in my heart.

286
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,110
<i>She's the same as me.</i>

287
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,540
<i>I played solo all my life, 
with nowhere to fit in,</i>

288
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,390
<i>and never wanted to see the world outside.</i>

289
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:45,080
<i>Even if we wanted to understand others, 
we never wanted them to understand us.</i>

290
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,830
<i>I can really relate to how she feels.</i>

291
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,740
Demon Lord,

292
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,180
Are you sure you won't 
eradicate the mortal races?

293
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,620
Enough of that.

294
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:58,980
I don't hate the mortal races as much as 
you do, and I haven't lost hope in them.

295
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,100
I see.

296
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,730
Then I have no other choice.

297
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,060
What are you planning to do?!

298
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,680
I don't expect to be 
forgiven for my betrayal.

299
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,570
So I'll end it now.

300
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,230
Wait!

301
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,440
Don't stop me!

302
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,070
I know I'm not normal!

303
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,700
I don't expect anyone to understand me!

304
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,830
Either way...

305
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,790
Either way, I'm all alone!

306
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,960
Stop!

307
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,140
You really are stubborn.

308
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,650
I told you before that you should relax.

309
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,320
Why does that even matter here?!

310
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,570
I entrapped Rem-sama to further my own goals!

311
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,690
That's not a sin I can ever atone for!

312
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,820
Don't be naïve enough to call 
death a means of atonement!

313
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,160
B-But I tried to wipe out the mortal races

314
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,850
while serving as an Imperial Knight!

315
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:10,990
So what?!

316
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,800
Who decided to put you in that position?

317
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,660
The emperor? The nobles? Your parents?

318
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,340
Why should you care about a position forced 
on you by people that mean nothing to you?!

319
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,700
You should you just be yourself!

320
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,010
Be myself?

321
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:29,180
Quit getting hung up on nonsense, 
and try living the life you want.

322
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,470
It doesn't matter what you think of yourself.

323
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,360
Just take the actions you need to take

324
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,110
when someone truly needs you.

325
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,280
Do that, and that'll be where you belong.

326
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,440
That's how it was for me.

327
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:51,500
Dying with some stupid idea that you're 
all alone in this world is no atonement!

328
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,570
Just try and take that easy way out.

329
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,330
The moment you do, 
I, the Demon Lord Diablo,

330
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,260
will show you what true fear is.

331
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:07,110
Do you really believe I'll 
find somewhere to fit in?

332
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,520
Even someone as ugly as me?

333
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,980
You're not ugly.

334
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,570
If your heart truly was ugly,

335
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:21,370
would you have risked coming 
to us for your partner's sake?

336
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,160
I, too, was all alone before 
I met Diablo and Shera.

337
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,420
There was a moment when I hated you, too.

338
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:33,110
But now that I've heard how you truly feel,

339
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,540
I can forgive you.

340
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,040
You can't let yourself 
lose to isolation, Alicia.

341
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,590
Rem-sama...

342
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,680
But how do I be myself?

343
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,990
Hell if I know!

344
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:45,800
Huh?!

345
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,800
You're the one who decides that!

346
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,710
Your life starts today, right now.

347
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,240
He's always been cool,

348
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,820
but this is the coolest Diablo's ever been.

349
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,210
Yes.

350
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,550
Diablo!

351
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,750
Are you all right?!

352
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,070
My magic points...

353
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:12,700
Then I'll give you magic power 
like before and re-energize you!

354
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,360
Right!

355
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,830
Let's all help Diablo perk up together!

356
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,330
If that's the case, then...

357
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,950
I suppose I must, just for today.

358
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,340
If it'll help Diablo recover...

359
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,070
Edelgard, you strip, too!

360
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,300
M-Me, too!

361
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,470
I'll also lend a hand!

362
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,920
Diablo!

363
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,540
Diablo fainted!

364
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,000
Wake up, Diablo!

365
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,270
Come back again, okay?

366
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,010
Well, then... I, Alicia Cristela, 
shall be heading off.

367
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,020
Be well.

368
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,890
Yes.

369
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,030
You should be okay now.

370
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,510
Thank you, miss!

371
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,370
I told you, we're having fruit tonight!

372
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,110
Meat!

373
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:40,800
Fruit!

374
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,830
Fruit doesn't give you strength!

375
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,880
<i>They haven't changed.</i>

376
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:43,880
It's meat!

377
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,640
What?

378
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,950
Which side are you on?

379
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,180
Th-This is pointless.

380
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,870
Okay.

381
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:56,700
Huh?

382
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,380
Then kiss the side you choose.

383
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,280
Huh?!

384
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,810
I mean, I know it was for the ritual, 
but you kissed Klem-chan.

385
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,680
When you did that right in front of us,

386
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,690
I was honestly a bit jealous.

387
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:12,080
We've belonged to you longer 
than she has, after all.

388
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,700
I won't be satisfied until 
you've gone further with us.

389
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,160
So?

390
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,200
Which is it?

391
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,170
Don't bother me with such nonsense!

392
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,560
Aw, why not?

393
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,970
Because I am Diablo!

394
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,490
The one feared as the Demon Lord!
