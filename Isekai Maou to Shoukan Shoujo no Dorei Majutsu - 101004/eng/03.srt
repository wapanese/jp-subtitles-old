00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:59,010
Episode Three
Fallen Assault

2
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,010
Sorry for making you all come out here.

3
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,140
I know you just completed a quest for us,

4
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,270
but we have a commission 
specifically for Diablo-san.

5
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,810
Someone's specifically requesting Diablo?

6
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,890
This isn't another trap, is it?

7
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,730
This one's fine.

8
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,980
After all,

9
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,240
it's directly from the head of the 
Mage's Association, Celestine Baudelaire,

10
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,860
and I personally received it from her.

11
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,400
From Celes?

12
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,250
Not to mention the reward's 
high for how simple it is.

13
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,120
So it includes reparations 
for the incident with Galluk?

14
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,790
Well, I imagine that's true.

15
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,250
I won't be going.

16
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:31,980
Huh?

17
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,750
I don't want to owe Celes any favors.

18
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,960
I wouldn't mind if it were a normal mission,

19
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,060
but I'm not taking on a quest from her 
with an unnecessarily high reward.

20
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,260
<i>She's strict on herself.</i>

21
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,520
But honestly, this is a boon for us.

22
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,070
We don't have that much money.

23
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,680
It's a simple mission,

24
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,570
so I think you'll be fine even 
if you're not all together.

25
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,920
What do you say, Diablo?

26
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,280
<i>I guess I could split the reward</i>

27
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,060
<i>we earn from this mission by 
paying Rem my lodging fee.</i>

28
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,280
If you don't want to come,
then stay here in the city by yourself.

29
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,410
I will.

30
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,510
Great!

31
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,920
So you and Shera-chan will be going, then?

32
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,670
That settles it.

33
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,930
I'm counting on you!

34
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,300
Go to the Bridge of Ulug 
and deliver refreshments...

35
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,610
So easy!

36
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,430
This really is a reparation...

37
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,590
Does Celes really think I'd accept this

38
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,310
and take the reward for such 
an obviously simple quest?

39
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,890
I think Celes-san is a nice person, though.

40
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,770
Hold it, Demon.

41
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,540
You're the one, right?

42
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,940
The Demon that everyone's talking 
about in town right now.

43
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,200
You look as evil as the rumors said.

44
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,960
Emile?!

45
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,310
<i>Rumors?</i>

46
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,380
<i>What rumors?</i>

47
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,390
I heard of an unfamiliar horned Demon

48
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,380
walking around with two 
collared women in tow.

49
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,380
That's you, right, Demon?

50
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,900
<i>They're really bad rumors!</i>

51
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,390
The Distorted Crown
 Makes the wearer appear
more like a Demon Lord.

52
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,820
<i>Wait, this is just my headgear,
the Distorted Crown.</i>

53
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,770
<i>They think they're real?</i>

54
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,730
Who is this?

55
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,560
He's said to be the strongest 
Warrior in the Adventurer's Guild.

56
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,030
Exactly!

57
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:24,570
My name is Emile Bichel Berger!

58
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:30,800
I'm the Guild's greatest, 
Level 50, Superhuman Warrior!

59
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,370
Love

60
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,290
Horned Demon, prepare yourself!

61
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:36,750
Emile Bichel Berger

62
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:36,830
Emile Bichel Berger

63
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:36,960
Emile Bichel Berger

64
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,040
Emile Bichel Berger

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,250
This is like in a game!

66
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,170
Emile Bichel Berger

67
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:37,290
Emile Bichel Berger

68
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:37,380
Emile Bichel Berger

69
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:37,500
Emile Bichel Berger

70
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:37,580
Emile Bichel Berger

71
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:37,710
Emile Bichel Berger

72
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:37,790
Emile Bichel Berger

73
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:37,920
Emile Bichel Berger

74
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,000
Emile Bichel Berger

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,130
Emile Bichel Berger

76
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:38,630
Emile Bichel Berger

77
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,160
This is it!

78
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:38,790
Emile Bichel Berger

79
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,920
Emile Bichel Berger

80
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,040
Emile Bichel Berger

81
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,210
Emile Bichel Berger

82
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,920
It's not a real Demon Lord 
roleplay without a challenger!

83
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:39,340
Emile Bichel Berger

84
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:39,460
Emile Bichel Berger

85
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:39,630
Emile Bichel Berger

86
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:39,750
Emile Bichel Berger

87
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:39,920
Emile Bichel Berger

88
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,050
Emile Bichel Berger

89
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:40,170
Emile Bichel Berger

90
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:40,340
Emile Bichel Berger

91
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:40,460
Emile Bichel Berger

92
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:40,630
Emile Bichel Berger

93
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:40,750
Emile Bichel Berger

94
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:40,880
Emile Bichel Berger

95
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,050
Emile Bichel Berger

96
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:41,170
Emile Bichel Berger

97
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:41,300
Emile Bichel Berger

98
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:41,920
Emile Bichel Berger

99
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,930
Who gave you permission to 
announce yourself, twerp?!

100
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,160
Diablo?!

101
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,120
And just who gave you permission 
to lead those two around?

102
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,690
Listen well, Demon.

103
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:59,900
I love all women!

104
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:02,740
Huh?

105
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,420
As a defender of women,

106
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,240
I cannot allow you to enslave 
Rem-chan and Shera-chan!

107
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,720
Emile, please listen!

108
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,740
These collars—

109
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,070
Fear not, you two!

110
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,000
I'll save you now!

111
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,150
<i>He's an oddball,</i>

112
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,760
<i>but this is my first time fighting 
a challenger here in this world.</i>

113
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,260
<i>He'll probably fight the same 
way others did in the game.</i>

114
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,630
<i>Since he's Level 50, he should be 
able to use some special techniques.</i>

115
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,140
<i>That stance...</i>

116
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,710
<i>Sword Smite?!</i>

117
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,240
<i>That's a Martial Art that allows one to</i>

118
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,160
<i>rush the enemy in an instant 
and deliver a slashing blow.</i>

119
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,400
<i>It's a standard opening move.</i>

120
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,520
<i>Huh?</i>

121
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,030
<i>Am I actually getting excited 
for the first time in a while?</i>

122
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,710
<i>A standard opening move like Sword Smite</i>

123
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,480
<i>is doomed to be seen through in PVP.</i>

124
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:56,220
<i>Skilled players will use the rushing 
motion of Sword Smite, cancel the slash,</i>

125
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,790
<i>and chain it to their next attack.</i>

126
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,050
Heh Heh Heh...

127
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,600
Isn't Diablo acting a little weird?

128
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,090
Here I go!

129
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,670
You'll be releasing those two!

130
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,630
Come!

131
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,810
You didn't cancel the slash?!

132
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,200
I'm shocked!

133
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,680
You can stop this blow?!

134
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,310
Hmph. I'm actually surprised 
at how unbelievable that was.

135
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,400
Alps Fall!

136
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,030
<i>Alps Fall?!</i>

137
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,120
<i>While that technique packs power,</i>

138
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,930
<i>the trade-off is the lengthy 
time it takes to activate.</i>

139
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,490
<i>He's using it at a range this close?!</i>

140
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,490
The power is building within me.

141
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,280
The moment I unleash this blow...

142
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,870
will be the moment of my victor—

143
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,750
Diablo?!

144
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,010
<i>I-It's like I'm facing a beginner.</i>

145
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,940
<i>I thought the levels in this world 
were lower than the game world,</i>

146
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,390
<i>but does that mean the skill 
of the players is just as low?</i>

147
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:59,220
<i>Well, it's possible this guy's just an idiot.</i>

148
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,270
I won't lose!

149
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,650
You have spirit, at least.

150
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,820
I can never fall before an enemy!

151
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,280
I won't be able to hold back next time.

152
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,160
I fight for the sake of oppressed women!

153
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,830
Very well.

154
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,410
Then come!

155
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,750
Stop!

156
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,290
Rem-chan? Shera-chan?

157
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,530
That's enough, Emile!

158
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,280
Don't abandon hope, Rem-chan!

159
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm going to...

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,800
That's not the case.

161
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,300
You're misunderstanding this.

162
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,510
In other words, this Enslavement 
Collar is on my neck

163
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,560
because of my own failure.

164
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,780
Diablo's actually working with 
us to get these collars removed.

165
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,680
It's hard to say this when 
you're sticking up for us,

166
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,320
but you're just jumping to conclusions.

167
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,830
I want to run away...

168
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,080
Oh, thank goodness!

169
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,870
So there are no women being forced 
to wear Enslavement Collars!

170
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,340
<i>That's some mental fortitude!</i>

171
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,510
I'm sorry, Demon.

172
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,880
What was your name?

173
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,090
Diablo.

174
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,640
My name is Emile Bichel Berger.

175
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,350
A defender of women, and all women's ally.

176
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,620
If you ever have need of my strength, 
you can call upon me anytime!

177
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,580
Though you were pretty good yourself.

178
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,110
Is that so?

179
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,350
Let's meet again, my friend!

180
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,360
<i>Friend?</i>

181
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,100
I'm sorry you had that 
misunderstanding because of us.

182
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,870
Hmph! A man that weak isn't 
even enough to entertain me.

183
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,280
Emile isn't a bad person.

184
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,630
His strength is true, as well.

185
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,400
But he seems like an idiot, huh?

186
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,710
<i>She said it!</i>

187
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,560
Errands, errands!

188
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,410
Off to the Bridge of Ulug!

189
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,140
<i>The Bridge of Ulug, huh?</i>

190
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,350
<i>In the game's setting,
it was built as a fortress</i>

191
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,400
<i>to protect Faltra from the 
monsters in the Man-Eating Woods.</i>

192
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,710
What lovely weather!

193
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,180
But isn't a simple delivery kind of boring?

194
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,360
Yeah.

195
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,570
Hey, want to go for a dip in the water?

196
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,410
Huh?!

197
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,100
Let's do it, let's do it!

198
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,880
Please?

199
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,860
<i>Bathing together with a w-w-woman?!</i>

200
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:32,420
<i>There's no way I can clear party events 
like that with my poor social skills!</i>

201
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,880
You fool!

202
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,720
How can you go b-b-bathing in 
the middle of a quest?!

203
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,750
But I'm bored!

204
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,390
I want to do something fun!

205
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,040
It would be fun if we triggered an Invasion.

206
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,060
Invasion?

207
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,440
It refers to when high-level monsters 
appear during a low-level quest.

208
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,240
Huh?!

209
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,150
No way! I don't want that!

210
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,960
I'm not strong like you, Diablo!

211
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,500
Y-Y-You fool!

212
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,950
What good comes from an 
adventurer fearing danger?!

213
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:06,000
I don't want things to stay 
like this forever, of course.

214
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,510
I want to grow strong like you and Rem

215
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,280
so I can actually make it on my own.

216
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,960
Hmph. Then continue working hard.

217
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,170
Thank you!

218
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,220
I might still cause trouble 
for you until then, though,

219
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,970
so help me out, Diablo!

220
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,350
That way I can grow even more and more!

221
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,540
<i>If they grow any more, I'll reach Heaven...</i>

222
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,570
That man! Is he a Fallen?!

223
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,240
Why is he coming from Faltra?!

224
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,870
Who are you? I am—

225
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,230
Shut up, you suspicious man!

226
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,450
If you're not a Fallen, 
then what are those horns?!

227
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,620
<i>My horns again?!</i>

228
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,800
Hold on, everyone!

229
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,320
This man's a Demon!

230
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,380
He's not a Fallen!

231
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,500
Boris?

232
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,610
He's probably the horned Demon 
everyone in town is talking about.

233
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,140
The one with the collared women.

234
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,520
<i>Saved by rumors...</i>

235
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,600
We're on a quest to bring refreshments here!

236
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,640
It's wine!

237
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:15,610
Really, it's awful of you to mistake 
me for the likes of a Fallen.

238
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,240
Has something happened here?

239
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,430
Actually...

240
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,030
We just received a report from our patrols

241
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:25,530
that a huge army of over a hundred 
Fallen is heading this way.

242
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,070
Fallen?!

243
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,290
A hundred?!

244
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,080
I know it's hard to believe, but...

245
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,790
<i>The Fallen were treated as boss monsters 
in every scenario of </i>Cross Reverie<i>.</i>

246
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,910
<i>I've never heard of an event 
where they attacked en masse.</i>

247
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,390
<i>Is this some large-scale Invasion 
that was never possible in the game?</i>

248
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,560
Hey! How's your end?!

249
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,670
Hurry into position!

250
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,060
Hurry!

251
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:54,060
What's going to happen, Diablo?

252
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,910
<i>What'll happen?</i>

253
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,720
<i>It goes without saying.</i>

254
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,070
<i>This place will be wiped out.</i>

255
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,450
<i>It's clear that the people of this world have</i>

256
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,160
<i>lower levels and weaker skills than
the player characters in the game.</i>

257
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,580
<i>They'll be massacred before 
they can even put up a fight.</i>

258
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,820
Diablo?

259
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,360
That's not the real problem.

260
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,080
Huh?

261
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,250
Even if they break through the Bridge of Ulug,

262
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:22,390
the Fallen shouldn't be able to enter Faltra 
with Celes's barrier protecting it.

263
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,920
So why engage in such a fruitless campaign?

264
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,320
They say the Fallen have been 
active here and there lately,

265
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,480
hoping to revive the Demon Lord Krebskulm.

266
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,680
<i>In which case, their target is Rem?</i>

267
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,360
<i>Have they realized that she secretly 
houses the Demon Lord within her?</i>

268
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,360
<i>Guess we should return to the city...</i>

269
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,460
<i>Even with my power,</i>

270
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,180
<i>taking on a hundred Fallen 
at once would be a bit tough.</i>

271
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,850
Um,

272
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,720
here...

273
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,990
Our letter of gratitude.

274
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,960
Huh?

275
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,280
It should serve as proof 
that we received the wine.

276
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,380
Should you really be discussing 
this during an emergency?!

277
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,720
You might say I'm being too relaxed,

278
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,670
but if today happens to be my last day,

279
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,380
then I want to live it out properly.

280
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,050
Your group isn't retreating?

281
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,640
If we retreat,

282
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,710
then people working the fields and the 
slower travelers will be in trouble.

283
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,600
It's our job to buy enough time for 
everyone to flee into the city.

284
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,650
Diablo...

285
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,130
Sorry, twerp, but your resolve will be wasted.

286
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:33,910
Huh?

287
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,670
Because I'm not going to
let this be your last day.

288
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,910
Rem-chan!

289
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,180
Rem-chan, you have a visitor!

290
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,780
A visitor?

291
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,440
Diablo-san,

292
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,350
the final traveler has passed through.

293
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,200
We're now lowering the gates

294
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,010
to buy as much time as possible 
for them to reach the city.

295
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,760
Then lower them quickly.

296
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,370
Please reconsider!

297
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,200
It's reckless to face them alone!

298
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,120
Diablo-san!

299
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,960
Here come the Fallen!

300
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,850
Fall back, all of you.

301
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,400
You'll make it harder for me 
to use my magic if you're nearby.

302
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,160
But...

303
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,630
Let's do as he says.

304
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,220
Don't worry. Diablo is very strong!

305
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,440
Diablo...

306
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,260
What?

307
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,140
Be careful.

308
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,830
<i>Be careful, huh?</i>

309
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,780
<i>That's the first time anyone has shown 
consideration for me before a battle.</i>

310
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,810
<i>I'm afraid of facing a hundred Fallen...</i>

311
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,210
But right now, I feel like I 
can beat even a Demon Lord!

312
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,920
All of you!

313
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,370
Who gave you permission to 
advance your army here?!

314
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,000
If you didn't know that I was in this land,

315
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,550
then be ashamed of your ignorance!

316
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:05,030
You're... tiny and weak.

317
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,800
Kill...

318
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,070
Kill...

319
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,250
Kill...

320
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,930
You still intend to face me?

321
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,500
Very well...

322
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,750
Then I'll exterminate you all!

323
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,630
I've discharged Galluk-san.

324
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:34,970
He arbitrarily used the Association's name 
to place you all in danger, after all.

325
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,130
Besides, it seems like he was also 
the one who caused that commotion

326
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,840
by bringing a Summon into town.

327
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,890
He needed to take responsibility.

328
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,160
I'm sorry he's caused 
you all so much trouble.

329
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,220
It's fine...

330
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,180
By the way, Galluk-san said 
something interesting.

331
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,220
Huh?

332
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,430
Apparently Diablo-san called 
himself a Demon Lord.

333
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,110
Diablo is a Demon Lord from another world.

334
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,040
Truly?

335
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,940
What do you mean?

336
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,290
I understand that you're very 
talented as a Summoner, Rem,

337
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,060
but I've never heard of a Demon 
Lord existing in another world,

338
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,050
and even if one did, I doubt 
they could be summoned here.

339
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,160
Perhaps...

340
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,470
There's a chance that he's a Fallen

341
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,680
who was drawn to you by the soul you possess?

342
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,130
That's not possible.

343
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:29,180
Diablo had plenty of opportunities 
to kill me if he wished!

344
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,520
Yet instead...

345
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,310
I'll crush the soul of Krebskulm for you.

346
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,550
Huh?!

347
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:41,700
Of course, we'll need to spend some time 
researching a way to extract it first.

348
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,670
Did I do something?!

349
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:51,130
That was the first time anyone 
said they wouldn't leave me.

350
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,550
You underestimate me too much.

351
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:59,430
I'm not so weak as to leave 
you over something that petty.

352
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,000
Yet instead?

353
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,460
Forget it.

354
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,180
I'm sorry, sir, but we're rented out right now.

355
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,740
Galluk-san?!

356
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,930
Celes-sama!

357
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,780
Would you please reconsider?!

358
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,040
Why do I need to leave 
the Mage's Association?!

359
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,590
You did something that was wrong.

360
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,410
I've only done what's right!

361
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:33,360
Yet everyone keeps lying 
about me being fired.

362
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,480
So I hurt them to try to get 
them to tell me the truth.

363
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,240
Hurt them?

364
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,050
Are the others at the 
Mage's Association safe?

365
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,570
Worry about me, please!

366
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,690
Settle down.

367
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,560
Let's talk about this calmly.

368
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,330
Everyone's crazy...

369
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,080
I've devoted myself to the Association,

370
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,820
yet in the end, no one 
understands the real me.

371
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,800
Figures what that woman said was right.

372
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,950
That man?

373
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,230
Stop, Galluk!

374
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,100
Don't disgrace yourself any further!

375
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,480
Like I could ever accept this world...

376
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,300
<i>What is that dagger?</i>

377
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,450
<i>I'm not sure, but I have a bad feeling...</i>

378
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,100
I have to be the one to correct this world!

379
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,060
Stop him, Shadow Snake!

380
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,450
Galluk-san?!

381
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,280
Galluk?!

382
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,630
It can't be...

383
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,070
Don't get close to him!

384
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,650
No way...

385
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,830
It can't...

386
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,500
Is this a Fallen?

387
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,560
It's finally time for the 
great Gregore's appearance.

388
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,400
That Human kept babbling on for damned ever...

389
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,850
Now,

390
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,850
are you prepared to die?

391
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,370
Incredible.

392
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,610
Diablo...

393
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,560
<i>That makes about thirty?</i>

394
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,740
<i>If I don't hold off on 
the big MP cost spells...</i>

395
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,370
I'll be done in before they are.

396
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,380
<i>Their commander's coming?</i>

397
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,890
Why did you climb off your monster?

398
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,660
Because... he wouldn't move?

399
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,660
He's usually a good, obedient one, too.

400
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,420
But he wouldn't move after seeing you.

401
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:19,400
Hmph. Your monster understands 
better than you do, then,

402
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,920
that one shouldn't just stroll up here.

403
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,700
He knows you can't defeat me.

404
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,890
I'm Edelgard, the strongest 
lancer of the Fallen.

405
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,150
I'm not going to lose to some Demon Sorcerer.

406
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,150
<i>If I defeat their commander,</i>

407
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,390
<i>there's a good chance the 
others will withdraw.</i>

408
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,150
<i>This fight will decide it.</i>

409
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,800
Very well!

410
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,910
I'll test you to see how strong you are, then!

411
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
Fight?

412
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,410
Or don't fight?

413
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,320
Fight!

414
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,970
It's over, Human.

415
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,400
If I take you down, we Fallen win.

416
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,040
You don't understand anything.

417
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,020
The true Demon Lord is none 
other than me, Diablo!

418
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,020

Point-Blank War Dance
