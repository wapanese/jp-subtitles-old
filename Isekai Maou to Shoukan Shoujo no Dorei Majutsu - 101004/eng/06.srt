1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,980
You figured out a way 
to release our collars?!

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,680
Don't be hasty.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,790
We're not certain yet.

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,730
I'm only talking about a possibility.

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,520
A slave caravan came in yesterday and 
set up a market in the central plaza.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,150
The Enslavement Collars and slave collars

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,940
are fundamentally the same 
on a magical level, so...

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,340
I see.

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,640
So we might be able to learn a way to release

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,250
our collars from someone 
who's used to handling them.

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,560
Are you sure about this, though?

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,480
I think resolving the issue 
with the Kingdom of Greenwood

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,630
is our highest priority right now.

14
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,780
<i>That's definitely true,</i>

15
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,800
<i>but if we can remove the 
Enslavement Collars,</i>

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,390
<i>I'd like to do it as soon as possible.</i>

17
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,640
Diablo?

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,010
Hmph.

19
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,210
The issue with the Elven nation

20
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,560
will be quickly resolved once I head there.

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,130
Time spent stopping by the slave 
market won't affect that result.

22
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,440
Shera-san,

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,500
I'm sorry this is all the 
help I can offer you

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,940
when you're in trouble with your nation.

25
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,960
Not at all! Thank you very much!

26
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,510
Episode Six
Slave Market

27
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,010
We might finally be able 
to get these collars off!

28
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,360
I bet my neck will feel breezy without it,

29
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,640
since I've gotten so used to having it on.

30
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,740
<i>So this is a slave market...</i>

31
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,340
Is something the matter, Diablo-sama?

32
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,650
No...

33
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,280
<i>I lived in Japan, so I've only ever seen 
slave markets in games and manga.</i>

34
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,320
Master!

35
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,000
<i>I'm not sure my heart can take this!</i>

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,910
<i>I need to be careful not to let it 
affect my Demon Lord persona.</i>

37
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,880
<i>This is...</i>

38
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,820
<i>not quite what I expected.</i>

39
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,820
Welcome to The Beloved Traveler.

40
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,820
My, my, what an entourage of customers.

41
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,090
Are you in charge here?

42
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,820
I'm the owner, Medios.

43
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,580
Oh?

44
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,830
Those are lovely girls.

45
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,630
If you're selling, I'll gladly buy 
them for an exceptional sum.

46
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,340
These two are not slaves!

47
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,480
Well, pardon me, then.

48
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,480
I presumed you were here to sell one off.

49
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,030
You possess tremendous 
magic power, don't you?

50
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,050
What?

51
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,500
What an incredible flow of magic power...

52
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,600
No amount of lives would save 
any poor soul who angered you.

53
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,820
<i>Flow of magic power? 
What is she talking about?</i>

54
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,360
I knew it!

55
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,690
You can tell that Diablo's strong right 
away from his flow of magic power!

56
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,280
Huh?

57
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,530
Oh?

58
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,620
You can see the flow of magic power, too?

59
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,610
Yeah!

60
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,970
Is that true?

61
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,290
You never said a word about that to us!

62
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,620
Well, you never asked.

63
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,130
I understand.

64
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,470
So you want me to teach you how 
to remove the Enslavement Collars.

65
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,620
Can you do it?

66
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,880
Well, now...

67
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,730
It's my first time dealing with a 
magic spell being reflected, too.

68
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,320
But since Celestine has sent you to me,

69
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,890
I can give it a try.

70
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,160
Yay!

71
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,400
Please do!

72
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,360
By the way,

73
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,050
you also possess quite an interesting flow.

74
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:01,900
Huh?

75
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,540
Magic power is perpetually 
pouring from you.

76
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,160
A very sinister power...

77
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,160
Do you recall anything

78
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,160
that might have caused you to 
become pregnant with a Demon?

79
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,830
Huh?!

80
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,440
What?!

81
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,720
I-Is that true, Rem-sama?!

82
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,160
When did that happen?!

83
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,810
This isn't funny!

84
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,370
Ah! That night Diablo tortured you!

85
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,330
That night!

86
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,840
Huh?! Me?!

87
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,970
We didn't do anything like that!

88
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,130
But when you share a bed alone with someone,

89
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,720
you get pregnant, right?

90
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,790
Huh?!

91
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,020
But I'm sensing Fallen energy 
from within a Pantherian...

92
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,980
That's enough idle chatter!

93
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,060
Tell us how to remove the collars at once!

94
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,240
Oh, I'll show you.

95
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,780
But it is a trade secret.

96
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,990
I'd like to show it to as few as possible.

97
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,480
I'll be standing by outside.

98
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,990
I'll hold off, as well...

99
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,360
I don't feel so good.

100
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,750
You don't look so good. Are you all right?

101
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,460
Could you see the magic power 
coming out of me all along?

102
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,370
Huh?

103
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,010
Yeah!

104
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:10,010
That's why I thought you must 
be a really strong adventurer.

105
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,370
I... see.

106
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,900
I'm glad you're such an idiot.

107
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,910
Hey, that was mean!

108
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:28,610
The soul of the Demon Lord 
Krebskulm is sealed within me.

109
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:34,200
My ultimate goal is to defeat the Demon 
Lord Krebskulm that lies within me

110
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,660
and extinguish her soul.

111
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,690
<i>That was close.</i>

112
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,880
<i>We'd be facing all kinds 
of trouble if she found out</i>

113
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,420
<i>about Krebskulm right now.</i>

114
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,940
<i>I guarantee that I'll save you someday!</i>

115
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,380
<i>So just wait until then, Rem!</i>

116
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,490
Are you really feeling unwell?

117
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,020
No, I'm fine.

118
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,960
Medios-san, was it?

119
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,240
I felt like she was going to 
see straight into my heart.

120
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,330
It was a little scary.

121
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,570
Even for an upstanding
Imperial Knight like you?

122
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,340
All the more because I'm an Imperial Knight.

123
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,580
The harder you try to be righteous,

124
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,940
the more your lies steadily increase.

125
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,060
Is that how it works?

126
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,340
That's a secret.

127
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,840
I was afraid my own secret 
would be brought to light.

128
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,140
Everyone has some kind of secret.

129
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,310
Oh, right!

130
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,370
I know of a charm to help you

131
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,480
conceal secrets when they're 
about to be exposed!

132
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,480
Though it's a little 
childish and embarrassing.

133
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,360
What kind of charm is it?

134
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,990
Could you close your eyes 
and hold one hand out for me?

135
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,950
In my hometown, we did this and said...

136
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,340
"There, all closed."

137
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,080
Everyone said that this would 
help protect your secrets.

138
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,870
Is something wrong?

139
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,520
N-No, nothing!

140
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,260
That's all.

141
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,950
It felt like my hand grew 
warmer for a moment.

142
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,790
It did?

143
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:19,010
It's my first time doing 
this with a Sorcerer,

144
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,940
so maybe something is actually cast 
when it's done with magic power.

145
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,270
I feel a little more relaxed 
after talking to you.

146
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,080
Thank you, Alicia-san.

147
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,530
I'm glad I was able to be useful to you.

148
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,910
Now, are you ready?

149
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,400
Why am I...

150
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,540
I thought we were just removing the collar.

151
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,440
It looks great on you!

152
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,050
<i>What kind of crazy outfit is 
this damn hag making her wear?!</i>

153
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:56,550
It's best to actually touch the 
skin the first time you do this.

154
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,770
Skin?!

155
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,400
Now, lie down.

156
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,580
Okay...

157
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,770
I'm going to teach Diablo-san

158
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,700
how to see your flow of magic power.

159
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,760
Once he learns that, 
he might be able to undo

160
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,070
the magic power imbued in your collars.

161
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,150
Okay, first, try touching Shera-chan's skin.

162
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,570
Sure.

163
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,700
Don't make weird sounds!

164
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,940
But...

165
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,210
Stop flirting and try 
reading her magic power.

166
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,360
Uh...

167
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,460
If you can use magic,
you should be able to do it.

168
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,590
Even if you can't see it,
sensing it is normal. Completely normal.

169
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,900
<i>This isn't working because I'm 
thinking of it as a person's skin.</i>

170
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,980
<i>I need to handle this like I'm casting magic.</i>

171
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,230
<i>Yes...</i>

172
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,200
<i>This isn't Shera.</i>

173
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,540
<i>It's a wand!</i>

174
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,780
<i>Wand, wand, wand, wand, wand, wand...</i>

175
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,740
Looks like you can see it.

176
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,460
Y-Yeah...

177
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,360
All right, next, why don't you try touching

178
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,250
where her flow of magic 
power is concentrated?

179
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,500
Here I go, Shera.

180
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,800
Okay. This is kind of scary, though.

181
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,010
Just trust me!

182
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,180
<i>Once I learn this,</i>

183
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:21,390
<i>I'll be sure to release the Enslavement 
Collars placed on you two!</i>

184
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,260
Do it!

185
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,390
<i>This is a wand!</i>

186
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,900
There!

187
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,590
Diablo, wait!

188
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,650
This feels incredible!

189
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,280
<i>This is her flow of magic power?</i>

190
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,920
<i>How far does this go?</i>

191
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,540
<i>I can't see the end!</i>

192
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,430
Don't be so rough there...

193
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,360
<i>Incredible!</i>

194
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,320
<i>When I change how I'm touching it, 
the range I can see changes, too!</i>

195
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,690
It seems like you can see most of it now.

196
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,690
Why don't you try going a little lower?

197
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,800
Lower?

198
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,120
Yes, and this time you're going to 
pour your own magic power into her.

199
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,310
Gently, gently...

200
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,310
Like you're embracing Shera-chan.

201
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,770
Ah, Diablo...

202
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,960
My belly button might be sensitive...

203
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,280
Find where her magic power is concentrated...

204
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,940
Here?

205
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,070
Not there!

206
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,340
Try to affect her magic power.

207
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,300
Slowly insert yours into her.

208
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,940
<i>Insert my magic power into Shera...</i>

209
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,120
You've broken past the surface 
and started to reach her core

210
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,750
in such a short time!

211
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,670
Shera, listen! We're finishing now!

212
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,010
Yes! Give it to me!

213
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,760
Diablo's...

214
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,190
Diablo's pouring into me!

215
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,990
What?

216
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,280
So in the end,

217
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,720
you quit before you could figure 
out how to release our collars?

218
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,420
It seemed like you were putting 
a lot of effort into it.

219
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,410
Yeah...

220
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,920
I managed to learn how to see the 
flow of magic power easily enough.

221
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,920
But we ran into trouble after that.

222
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,090
The flow of magic power pouring out 
of these Enslavement Collars is...

223
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,180
It's like countless balls of yarn

224
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,640
strewn about an endless 
room, all tangled together.

225
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,490
I need to unravel that 
mess thread by thread,

226
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,120
but the room is so full of smoke 
that I can't see them very well,

227
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,940
and I can only stay in the 
room while holding my breath.

228
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,190
That's what it felt like.

229
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,790
I see...

230
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,060
You look energized, though.

231
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,020
Yeah!

232
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,200
All I had to do was lie down.

233
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,270
Then Diablo's hot essence poured into me,

234
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,600
so I'm actually full of energy!

235
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,060
Somehow, I'm really tired today.

236
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,210
I know it's a bit early, 
but shall we go to bed?

237
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,840
<i>I'm all for that.</i>

238
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,360
<i>I'm confident I could sleep like the dead.</i>

239
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,220
By the way, where are you 
planning to sleep, Alicia-san?

240
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,080
<i>She couldn't possibly...</i>

241
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,480
<i>I'm getting the feeling the greatest 
accident ever might happen!</i>

242
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,590
<i>I don't have the stamina 
left for that tonight!</i>

243
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,980
<i>Though even if I had the stamina, 
I couldn't do anything!</i>

244
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,240
I've rented the room next to yours,
so you needn't worry.

245
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,840
I see.

246
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,240
Well, then, if you'll excuse me.

247
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,280
The sound of a flute?

248
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,790
It's a pretty timbre.

249
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,030
It can't be...

250
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,380
This sound...

251
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,750
An Elf?

252
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,210
No way...

253
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,680
Why are you here,

254
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,560
Nii-san?!

255
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,560
<i>Nii-san?!</i>

256
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,720
Nice to meet you.

257
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,520
I'm Shera's older brother,
First Prince of the Kingdom of Greenwood,

258
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,750
Keera L. Greenwood.

259
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,130
I've finally found you, Shera.

260
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,340
Now, come home with your brother.

261
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,460
So you're the stupid prince 
who put a bounty on Shera?

262
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,890
Diablo?!

263
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,410
According to our reports,

264
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:29,240
the adventurers seeking the bounty 
were defeated and captured.

265
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,350
I'm not about to let Shera get 
kidnapped by such weaklings!

266
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,110
That's good.

267
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:36,850
Huh?

268
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,550
Actually, I said, "I'd like to show my gratitude

269
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,950
to the man safeguarding my little sister,"

270
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,110
and it seems that caused 
a misunderstanding.

271
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,700
Misunderstanding?

272
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,860
I'm relieved to see that you are all well.

273
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,340
We heard that the Elves were prepared 
to wage war if Princess Shera

274
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,050
wasn't handed over, though.

275
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,620
I have no intention of going 
to war with the Humans.

276
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,440
My father is just so concerned 
with Shera's well-being.

277
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,880
Please allow me to apologize on my father's 
behalf for his inappropriate remarks.

278
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,920
<i>This isn't exactly what we expected.</i>

279
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,230
<i>Sure, finding a peaceful resolution 
would be the best outcome, but...</i>

280
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,760
This isn't right!

281
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,850
You're not acting like yourself, Nii-san!

282
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:19,740
If you speak the truth, Prince Keera,
then we're happy to hear it,

283
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,210
but we're left questioning if 
you're trying a different approach

284
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,110
now that your forceful measures have failed.

285
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,290
I'm so sorry, Shera!

286
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,230
I've been prioritizing our country

287
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,960
so much that I ignored your feelings.

288
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,870
I didn't realize what I should be 
cherishing most until I'd lost you.

289
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,670
Can you ever find it in you to 
forgive your foolish brother?

290
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,680
What...

291
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,260
I'm going to respect Shera's opinion on this.

292
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,040
I don't know if what you say 
is true or not, Prince Keera,

293
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,130
but I agree with you that Shera's 
feelings are what matters most here.

294
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,360
Whether she returns to her 
nation or stays here with us

295
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,140
is for her to decide.

296
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,060
Rem...

297
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,270
I understand.

298
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,370
I'm not lying about Shera's 
feelings mattering most.

299
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,280
I'll take my leave for today.

300
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,880
It seems that our sudden reunion 
has made Shera emotional,

301
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,320
so I'll come again tomorrow.

302
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,790
At that time, please let me know
your true feelings once more.

303
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,940
Hmph.

304
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,450
And if Shera still says 
she won't return home?

305
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,420
Then war?

306
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,280
Heavens, no!

307
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,860
I'll respect Shera's decision!

308
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,670
I swear to God that I'll accept her choice.

309
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,580
<i>He was surprisingly decent.</i>

310
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,260
But what about you...

311
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,180
if she says that she'll return home?

312
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,840
What a foolish question.

313
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,050
There's no chance of that at all.

314
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,940
Diablo...

315
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,660
If she truly were to decide to go home,

316
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,690
then she can do as she pleases.

317
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,700
Of course.

318
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,050
Diablo...

319
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,210
Can't sleep?

320
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,240
Rem...

321
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,680
You're awake?

322
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,480
Standing in the night air in your 
nightgown isn't good for your health.

323
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,540
Sorry. I'll close the window.

324
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,660
I don't mind.

325
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,230
Huh?

326
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,490
Shall we talk for a bit?

327
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,990
What do you plan on doing tomorrow?

328
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,920
Huh?

329
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,110
I mean,

330
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,990
will you go with Prince Keera... or not?

331
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,480
I'm not going home.

332
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,750
I made that decision when I left.

333
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,730
Prince Keera was a surprisingly nice fellow.

334
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,640
I can't tell whether or 
not Nii-san was lying.

335
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,260
Are you worried?

336
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,110
Not about that...

337
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,290
I recalled several things 
about my homeland.

338
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,160
So you were feeling nostalgic?

339
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,430
Yes! That!

340
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,940
Shh! You'll wake Diablo.

341
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,900
Oh, sorry.

342
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,150
<i>I'm already awake, actually.</i>

343
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,330
What are you going to do from here?

344
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,530
From here?

345
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,540
You shouldn't be hunted down 
by any Elves anymore.

346
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,570
I don't think you'd need to continue

347
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,660
adventuring and moving around all the time.

348
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,080
Hmm...

349
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,520
I want to continue adventuring, though.

350
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,920
Aside from that, I'd love 
to try opening a café.

351
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,940
A café?

352
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,510
Doesn't it sound lovely?

353
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:40,830
Everyone could have fun drinking 
coffee and eating snacks.

354
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,040
That's too vague for me to picture.

355
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,310
Well, I've never been to one before.

356
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,110
There was a new one that 
opened recently in Faltra.

357
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,690
You're kidding! I want to go!

358
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,890
You know, I've thought about this a lot.

359
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,770
Once I open the café, I'll be its owner!

360
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,690
And you can be a waitress,

361
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,820
and Diablo can be in charge 
of polishing the cups!

362
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,260
<i>Cups...</i>

363
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:05,070
Why are you involving us in your dream?

364
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:05,900
Huh?

365
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,330
That's obvious, isn't it?

366
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:11,830
Because you're the first friends I made 
after leaving the Elven nation!

367
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,440
Your first friends, huh?

368
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,150
Wherever you and Diablo are

369
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:25,850
would definitely be the new place I call home.

370
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,100
You two have done so much for me,

371
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,840
and you're my precious friends.

372
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,690
You're more family than my real family now.

373
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,150
Unfortunately, I can't be part of 
your plans for the future right now.

374
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,590
I'm burdened with a certain
problem at the moment.

375
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,650
Until that problem is resolved,

376
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,040
I don't have any leeway 
to consider the future.

377
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,380
And this problem is not 
only a very difficult one,

378
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,560
but it's so depressing, it makes me want

379
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,850
to give up sometimes.

380
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,240
Is there anything I can do?

381
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,380
I don't know.

382
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,500
Well, you have Diablo, then!

383
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,120
True...

384
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,960
Diablo might be able to 
do something about it.

385
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,540
So...

386
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:19,990
If you'll still welcome me again 
after that problem is resolved...

387
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,910
Then maybe I will join you at that café.

388
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,200
Rem!

389
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,200
Ah, hey!

390
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,150
Get off me!

391
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,410
No way!

392
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,170
Rem! Rem! Rem!

393
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,000
I love you, Rem!

394
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,530
I-I get it! Now get off of me!

395
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,480
Nope!

396
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,450
S-Stupid Shera!

397
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,150
Let go of my tail!

398
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,440
I've always wanted to try touching it!

399
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,660
S-Stop it!

400
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,480
Then...

401
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,780
Where are you touching me?!

402
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,320
Diablo did this to me today.

403
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,060
He poured his magic power into me like this.

404
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,520
Why are you recreating that with me?!

405
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah! It makes you cry out like that!

406
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,860
You stupid Shera!

407
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,030
<i>I... I can't sleep now!</i>

408
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,990
Shera...

409
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,650
By this time tomorrow,

410
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,130
you'll belong to me.

411
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,100
I can't wait.

412
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,730
You'll bear my child,

413
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,000
Shera!

414
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,850
You belong to me, Shera!

415
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,400
Because I'm Shera's friend.

416
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,690
Tell me...

417
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,020
Episode Seven
Change of Heart

418
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,020
how you really feel!
