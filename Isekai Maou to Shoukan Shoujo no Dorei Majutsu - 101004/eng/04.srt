1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,610
Move it!

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,490
Hurry!

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:07,730
The Fallen are coming!

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,560
We're all right now.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,490
The city is protected 
by Celes-sama's barrier.

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,730
The Fallen can't get in here.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,000
So you're Celestine Baudelaire?

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,000
You can go ahead and die, for starters.

9
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,010
Episode Four
Point-Blank War Dance

10
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,010
It was easy to penetrate your barrier, 
thanks to that stupid Human.

11
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:08,520
I guess even you can't 
detect camouflaged Fallen.

12
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,010
No way...

13
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,270
I can't believe Galluk-san 
would lead a Fallen here.

14
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,550
You tricked Galluk into this!

15
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,530
Rem-sama!

16
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,620
Please take care of Celes-sama!

17
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,030
I'm not letting you escape!

18
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,360
Everyone, run!

19
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,530
There's a Fallen!

20
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,550
Rem-san, that hurts!

21
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,810
Just hang in there!

22
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,060
No, not that way!

23
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,360
Your game of tag is over, shrimp!

24
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,970
Come forth, Asulau!

25
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,620
Oh, a Summon, huh?

26
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,590
In just one blow?!

27
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,630
Guess you can die first, then.

28
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,510
Rem-chan!

29
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,680
Who the hell are you?

30
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,080
My name is Emile Bichel Berger,

31
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,050
and I am an ally of all women!

32
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,030
Emile!

33
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,560
I can't believe a Fallen is 
running loose in the city.

34
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:49,290
But more than that, I cannot 
forgive you for targeting women!

35
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,920
Huh?

36
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,330
Celes-sama is the keystone of 
the barrier protecting this city!

37
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,670
We'll protect her with our lives!

38
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,350
You're interesting, Humans!

39
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:07,690
Let's see you do your best to 
entertain me, the great Gregore!

40
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,870
Hey, you're pretty strong for a Human.

41
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,490
Right now, I'm fighting to protect someone!

42
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,490
That means I'm invincible!

43
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,240
And you won't shut up! This is great!

44
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,370
What was that?

45
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,420
What did you just...

46
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,860
Magic, Human!

47
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,720
I'm the greatest Sorcerer 
in the Man-Eating Woods!

48
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,550
What?!

49
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,230
My favorite thing to do

50
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:50,460
is plunge confident Humans 
like you into despair!

51
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,220
I can't get enough of the face 
you all make in that moment!

52
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,320
Sword Smite!

53
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,730
I forgot to mention it,

54
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,280
but I'm a strong Warrior, too.

55
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,790
Dark Bullet!

56
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,200
Emile!

57
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,600
Emile-san!

58
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,560
Emile, please run!

59
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,260
You're outmatched!

60
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,950
Don't say such silly things, Rem-chan.

61
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,970
I'll never turn my back on an enemy!

62
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,390
My name is Emile Bichel Berger!

63
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,980
I am the defender of all women!

64
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,230
It's over, Human.

65
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,010
<i>She's rather strong.</i>

66
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,010
<i>About Level 80?</i>

67
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,050
<i>However...</i>

68
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:17,140
It's foolish to believe you can 
defeat me with so little strength.

69
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,350
Then I'll...

70
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,520
use this.

71
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,030
What's that?

72
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,530
<i>Oh, she's using Sacrificial Charge?</i>

73
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,300
<i>It's a powerful skill that 
consumes one's own hit points.</i>

74
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,860
<i>I might be able to use this 
to break her will to fight.</i>

75
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,030
Interesting!

76
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,660
I'll take that move of yours head-on!

77
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,550
Go ahead and try to damage me!

78
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,340
Yeah, I will.

79
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,680
Sacrificial...

80
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,560
...Charge!

81
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,820
Diablo!

82
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,330
I see.

83
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,560
This can't be.

84
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,840
I landed a solid hit...

85
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,300
Diablo!

86
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,770
Boris, bad news!

87
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,160
<i>So this is how damage feels?</i>

88
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,820
<i>It's my first time really taking 
any since I came to this world.</i>

89
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,600
Have you finally realized the 
difference in our abilities?

90
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,850
It seems your most powerful 
blow was unable to injure me.

91
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,290
<i>What is she hesitating for?</i>

92
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,360
<i>She should see that she 
has no chance of winning.</i>

93
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,190
<i>Any further combat is pointless.</i>

94
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,850
<i>Why isn't she withdrawing her army?</i>

95
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,870
Diablo-san!

96
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,800
A messenger came from the city!

97
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,130
Celestine-sama is being attacked by a Fallen!

98
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,890
They said a Pantherian woman was with her!

99
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,260
It has to be Rem!

100
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,630
So Gregore did his job well?

101
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,640
He's an idiot, but nicely done.

102
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,560
<i>They snuck a soldier into 
the city ahead of time?!</i>

103
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,770
<i>Are they planning to break 
the barrier by killing Celes,</i>

104
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,640
<i>then push through here 
and and storm the city?</i>

105
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,960
So...

106
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,780
Once we finish you off,

107
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,740
we Fallen win.

108
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,980
Tch!

109
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,780
<i>This is even worse if Rem is caught up in it!</i>

110
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,200
<i>I don't have time to be out here!</i>

111
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,510
I'm using Grand Magic!

112
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,940
If you don't want to die,
curl up behind those stone walls!

113
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,700
I have no pity for the Fallen,

114
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,140
but I'll offer one last time.

115
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,970
If you withdraw now, I'll spare you.

116
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:01,370
I seek the revival of the Demon Lord.

117
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,840
That and exterminating Humanity

118
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,480
are my duties.

119
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,480
So, I will do my best.

120
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,490
Hmph, you dare say you 
work for the Demon Lord?

121
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,310
I hate being laughed at.

122
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,490
You know nothing.

123
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,070
I am the true Demon Lord.

124
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,000
There are no others before Demon Lord Diablo!

125
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,620
True Demon Lord?

126
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,430
White Nova!

127
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,070
Impossible...

128
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,070
This cannot...

129
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,570
Demon Lord Diablo...

130
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,880
<i>I'm shocked.</i>

131
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,230
<i>She's still alive after taking a White Nova?</i>

132
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,330
Diablo, Let's hurry!

133
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,390
<i>There's no time to walk back.</i>

134
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,820
I'm trying Return Magic!

135
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,120
<i>Please!</i>

136
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,210
<i>Let this work the same as it did in-game!</i>

137
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,710
Return!

138
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,220
He vanished?

139
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,730
You're the only one left?

140
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,300
I won't be defeated.

141
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,990
For the sake of my fallen 
comrades, I'll never...

142
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,240
Stop this already, Emile!

143
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,990
You'll wind up dead!

144
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,120
Don't worry.

145
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,450
I'll protect you no matter what.

146
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:31,550
Good grief, but you Humans are persistent.

147
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,000
Just die already.

148
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,060
Diablo...

149
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,180
It's hard to say I've made it in time,

150
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,920
but it seems you're still alive, Rem, Celes.

151
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,820
Rem!

152
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,700
I'm so glad you're alive!

153
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,700
Ow!

154
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,680
Are you all right?!

155
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,880
You're bleeding!

156
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,430
This is nothing.

157
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,080
More importantly, Emile's...

158
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,820
Twerp, you're still alive, right?

159
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,650
Yes, my friend.

160
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,800
I acknowledge the fight you've put up.

161
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,090
I'll take it from here.

162
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,950
Here's a healing potion.

163
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,850
Use it on Emile.

164
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:36,190
Are you really saying you'll fight a Fallen?

165
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,860
To protect us?

166
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,650
I'm just meting out a fitting punishment

167
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,380
to the insolent being who attacked my base.

168
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,530
Don't get the wrong idea.

169
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,980
So there are good Demon Lords, too.

170
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:57,560
That was quite the foolish 
stunt for a mere Demon!

171
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,700
<i>He's a Sorcerer who's developed 
his abilities as a Warrior.</i>

172
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,580
<i>In </i>Cross Reverie<i>, he'd be a Brawler Sorcerer.</i>

173
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,790
<i>To think there was one among the Fallen.</i>

174
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,230
No matter how you beg for your life,

175
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,750
I'm killing you!

176
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,390
And right after that, I'll destroy the barrier!

177
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,990
Even if you destroy the barrier,

178
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,740
Edelgard won't be coming.

179
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,030
I dealt quite a bit of damage to her.

180
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,260
I defeated most of the Fallen army, too.

181
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,000
Such bold-faced lies.

182
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,450
You'll understand once you fight me.

183
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,040
You'll see which one of us should 
be begging for his life.

184
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:38,010
Of course, no matter how you beg for your life,

185
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,790
I won't spare you.

186
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,870
Dark Bullet!

187
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,590
What's that?

188
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,050
That's Diablo's...

189
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,640
Magic Reflection?!

190
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,370
What the hell have you done?!

191
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,640
Dark Bullet.

192
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,110
Quit whining.

193
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,230
I haven't used my real magic yet.

194
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,520
Wh-What is this power?!

195
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,930
There's no way a Fallen Sorcerer is only 
capable of using Dark Bullet, right?

196
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,860
Dark Press!

197
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,210
Take this!

198
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:29,130
Wh-What the hell have you been doing?!

199
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,030
You still don't understand?

200
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,720
I suppose your brain <i>is</i> only a lizard's.

201
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,280
Dark Press.

202
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,100
I get it!

203
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,550
I'll leave the city,

204
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,450
so spare me!

205
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,210
P-Please!

206
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,060
Please!

207
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,710
I told you at the start, didn't I?

208
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,910
No matter how you beg for your life,

209
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,500
I won't spare you.

210
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,180
You'll pay for your crimes with your death.

211
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,880
You've killed too many.

212
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,970
N-No!

213
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,850
P-Please don't kill me!

214
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,850
Naraku.

215
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,570
I'm sealing you in a dimension of darkness.

216
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,320
For eternity.

217
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,110
<i>This exhaustion really is awful.</i>

218
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,720
<i>I did end up using a lot of Magic Points.</i>

219
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,970
Diablo!

220
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,460
Diablo!

221
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,240
I thought we were done for.

222
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,470
Thank you so much.

223
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,740
Truly, truly...

224
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,440
Huh? Y-Yeah...

225
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,490
You really might...

226
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,140
be able...

227
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,250
to save me.

228
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,010
Yes, I did promise that.

229
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,090
<i>Shoot!</i>

230
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,800
<i>Shoot, shoot, shoot!</i>

231
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,760
<i>What would a Demon Lord say 
next at a time like this?!</i>

232
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,890
<i>I've never seen a woman thank a 
Demon Lord before, so I don't know!</i>

233
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,320
Y-Your Enslavement Collar!

234
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,020
Huh?

235
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,030
In short,

236
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,810
it means that you belong to me,

237
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,070
so of course I'd protect my possessions!

238
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,160
I didn't fight for your sake!

239
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,570
<i>W-Was that pushing it?</i>

240
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,060
I belong to you?

241
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,500
Right...

242
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,170
So long as this Enslavement Collar lasts.

243
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,200
<i>Why does she seem so happy about that?!</i>

244
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,300
Hey! Only Rem?

245
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,900
I belong to you too, right?

246
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,290
<i>Uh, I'm exhausted right now,</i>

247
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:20,180
<i>so if you press those against me...</i>

248
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,270
<i>They bounce!</i>

249
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,300
Diablo!

250
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,780
<i>H-Hard!</i>

251
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,010
Diablo hit his head and passed out?!

252
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:36,800
What?!

253
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,850
Oh, no!

254
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,740
<i>The casualties of the Fallen's assault 
were buried three days later.</i>

255
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,530
<i>Nearly all of those lost in 
this assault were Adventurers.</i>

256
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,350
<i>This world isn't like the game.</i>

257
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:20,720
<i>When someone dies, there are no salvation 
mechanisms like resurrection,</i>

258
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,430
<i>and I was bitterly forced to accept that.</i>

259
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,160
<i>What surprised me the most</i>

260
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,890
<i>was that even after facing such tragedy,</i>

261
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,620
<i>many people still retained the light of hope.</i>

262
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,380
<i>They took each other's hands</i>

263
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,350
<i>and tried to return to their normal lives.</i>

264
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,690
<i>That was never in the game, either.</i>

265
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,160
<i>As for me...</i>

266
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,200
10
Days
Later

267
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,410
Like this?

268
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,120
Diablo, are you awake?

269
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,670
I'm awake, but still sleepy.

270
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,050
Hey, let's go on a quest.

271
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,760
I'm bored.

272
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,190
<i>It's already been ten days since then.</i>

273
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,140
<i>I consumed too much MP, though,</i>

274
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,730
<i>so I still can't shake the 
melancholy mood hanging over me.</i>

275
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:33,100
Maybe I'll just go ahead and 
become mold on these sheets.

276
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,110
Come on, what are you saying?

277
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,860
Get up!

278
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,300
Wha?!

279
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,280
Wha... Huh?! Wha?!

280
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,250
Diablo, think you can perk up now?

281
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:55,320
Sylvie-san said doing this 
would make a man perk up.

282
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,210
<i>What are you teaching her, 
you wicked Guildmaster?!</i>

283
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,970
Hey, how about it?

284
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,370
Are you feeling better?

285
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,970
Shera!

286
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,300
Why are you dressed like that?!

287
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,440
Uh... I'm hot?

288
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,680
You're hot because you keep clinging to him!

289
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,480
Get away! Stay at least thirty 
steps away from Diablo!

290
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,560
What?

291
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,630
But that puts me out of the room!

292
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,970
Why are you constantly pressing 
your breasts against him?!

293
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,450
Because they hit him when I hug him!

294
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,580
Though in your case, your ribs might hit him.

295
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,580
That wouldn't happen!

296
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,150
<i>She's right!</i>

297
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,190
<i>I think I can feel her ribs a bit.</i>

298
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,950
<i>But this is also...</i>

299
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,260
Morning!

300
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,220
Getting along well, are we?

301
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,870
Sylvie-san, good morning!

302
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,890
Hey, Shera-chan.

303
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:55,980
Diablo-san, too.

304
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,440
Glad to see you're feeling well.

305
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,240
So, what did you need, Sylvie?

306
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,770
I've brought information I thought 
you'd be interested in, Diablo-san.

307
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,450
Oh?

308
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,190
The Lord of Faltra City has received demands

309
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,660
from the Elven Kingdom for Shera 
L. Greenwood to be handed over.

310
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,760
The deadline is ten days from now,

311
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,800
and they say they're not afraid to 
wage war if their demands aren't met.

312
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,040
War?

313
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,360
Is he sane?

314
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,130
He'd have people fighting one another?

315
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,640
The lord just issued a request for us
to try and resolve this quietly.

316
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:35,850
Are you saying you accepted a quest 
that requires turning Shera over?!

317
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,320
Hold on, hold on!

318
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,880
You know I wouldn't do that.

319
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,590
Do you really think I'd try to seize Shera

320
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:46,040
from the man who routed an army of Fallen?

321
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,120
Hmph. It seems you're not an idiot.

322
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,290
So, here's the quest from 
me and our troubled lord.

323
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,990
Stop a war from breaking out 
with the Elven Kingdom. Okay,

324
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,000
Diablo-san?

325
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,040
I am Lt. General Chester Ray Galford.

326
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,730
Let's work hard together 
so everyone can be happy!

327
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,720
No, let go of me!

328
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,060
Episode Five
Imperial Knights

329
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,060
Shera!
