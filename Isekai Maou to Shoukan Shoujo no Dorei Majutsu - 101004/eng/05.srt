1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,710
Prevent a war?

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:06,730
Yup.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,110
Assuming you don't want 
to hand over Shera-chan.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,680
The Lord of Faltra City has received 
demands from the Elven Kingdom

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,620
for Shera L. Greenwood to be handed over.

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,590
The deadline is ten days from now,

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:25,000
and they say they're not afraid to 
wage war if their demands aren't met.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,750
No way...

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,460
What'll you do, Diablo-san?

10
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,470
Episode Five
Imperial Knight

11
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,200
You're kidding...

12
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,470
You're kidding, right?

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,850
Greenwood is going to war with 
the Kingdom of Lyferia over me?

14
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,090
At this rate, yeah.

15
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,280
That's why the lord and 
I are both in trouble.

16
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,110
<i>Back then...</i>

17
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,720
<i>Shera made her feelings known and clearly 
told them she didn't want to go home.</i>

18
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,660
<i>They still haven't given up?</i>

19
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,660
So...

20
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,670
We'd like you to work out a way 
to prevent this war, Diablo-san.

21
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,870
Okay?

22
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,420
I absolutely refuse!

23
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,420
<i>I absolutely refuse!</i>

24
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,270
<i>How am I supposed to prevent a war?!</i>

25
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:45,930
Rant

26
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:45,930
Rant

27
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,040
<i>Negotiate?</i>

28
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,930
Gripe

29
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,480
<i>If had the communication 
skills to do that,</i>

30
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:45,930
Gripe

31
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,230
<i>I wouldn't be struggling to keep 
faking this Demon Lord persona!</i>

32
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,930
<i>That's something the people 
in power should figure out!</i>

33
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,930
<i>But reality never works out that way.</i>

34
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,430
<i>What do I do to protect Shera?</i>

35
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,560
<i>What should I do?</i>

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,240
By the way, Prince Keera from 
the Kingdom of Greenwood

37
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,700
has put a huge bounty on Shera-chan.

38
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,820
What?!

39
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,280
Nii-san did?!

40
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,580
Absurd.

41
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,410
The reward is enough for a commoner 
to goof off for the rest of their life.

42
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,760
From now on, you'll never know when or where

43
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,950
some imprudent adventurer will 
try to go after Shera-chan.

44
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,420
You'd be better off not going outside at all.

45
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,300
That's...

46
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,590
That's just...

47
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,040
Shera...

48
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,720
Diablo?!

49
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,000
He placed a bounty on his own little sister?

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,900
Screw him!

51
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,980
If there's any fool out there blinded by greed,

52
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,730
I'll make them regret challenging me!

53
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,320
Diablo!

54
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320
You belong to me.

55
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,130
I told you before, right?

56
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,610
Yeah.

57
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,030
So no matter who comes after you,

58
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,490
I won't let them lay a finger on you.

59
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,380
You can continue walking proudly 
through the city, just like always.

60
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,470
What do we do about the 
Kingdom of Greenwood?

61
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,660
The first step to clearing any 
quest is gathering information.

62
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,260
So we're going to go 
talk to the lord right now.

63
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,980
As if I'm gonna let him start some stupid war!

64
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,340
Thank you, Diablo!

65
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,150
I'll go with you, too!

66
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,470
I'll follow you anywhere, Diablo!

67
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,270
Ahem...

68
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,480
Go change your clothes first, stupid Shera.

69
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,600
The lord is the hero of this city.

70
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,660
Hero?

71
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,370
It happened thirty years ago.

72
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,100
When the Demon Lord was still around,

73
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,660
he fought on the front lines and 
defeated several Fallen single-handedly.

74
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,650
Sounds like Diablo the other day.

75
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,300
What's his level?

76
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,760
We've never assessed him, so I wouldn't know.

77
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,050
He's not an adventurer, either.

78
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,720
He might have been measured long ago,

79
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,280
but he's not the kind of person 
I could ask about that easily.

80
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,340
Do you mean the lord...

81
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,160
is hard to talk to?

82
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,160
People say he can be pretty rigid.

83
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,950
He's a little scary.

84
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,360
So Diablo-san...

85
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,450
Be careful how you speak to him, okay?

86
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,500
H-Hey, Galford-san!

87
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,750
Nice weather we're having, huh?

88
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,690
Can Diablo even use polite language?

89
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,040
Shh! Shut up, stupid Shera!

90
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,820
Diablo-san has accepted 
the quest about that matter.

91
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,760
In that case,

92
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,230
he should resolve the problem quickly.

93
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,490
You can report to me after 
the quest is complete.

94
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,690
Well, the difficulty of the quest 
is pretty high, you know?

95
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,570
So he wanted to gather 
some more information.

96
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,790
I believe I already told you 
everything you need to know.

97
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,250
Well, true, but...

98
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,310
Oh, right!

99
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,200
Could you at least introduce 
yourself to them?

100
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,100
Good grief...

101
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,980
Adventurers who don't even know 
the name of their lord?

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,060
I am Lieutenant General Chester Ray Galford.

103
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,400
His Royal Majesty has entrusted the 
fortified city, Faltra, to me.

104
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,500
I'm Rem Galleu, an adventurer.

105
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,820
I'm Shera L. Greenwood.

106
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,920
<i>S-S-Scary!</i>

107
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,660
<i>What's with this tense atmosphere?!</i>

108
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,410
Demon
Lord
Mode

109
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,410
Humble
Spirited
Mode

110
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,270
<i>Introductions?!</i>

111
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,580
<i>Trying to do this without dropping my Demon 
Lord act or provoking the other guy</i>

112
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,960
<i>sets the hurdle way too high!</i>

113
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,420
Difficulty

114
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,100
<i>This seems way more difficult 
than preventing a war!</i>

115
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,170
Y-Yeah...

116
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,350
I am Diablo.

117
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,800
I've come to hear you out.

118
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,180
<i>I did it!</i>

119
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,960
<i>I managed a peaceful introduction 
with my poor communication skills!</i>

120
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,430
<i>I can do it when I try!</i>

121
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,600
According to my reports, you call yourself 
the "Demon Lord from another world."

122
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,940
Is that true?

123
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:11,020
Shall I reduce you to ash to prove it?

124
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,880
Diablo!

125
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,550
W-Wait, please!

126
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,710
He's always like this!

127
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,600
He doesn't mean anything by it!

128
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,660
Hmph.

129
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,590
You adventurers truly are a strange lot.

130
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,800
Huh?

131
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,300
Look behind you.

132
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,480
Southeast of the city lies Seplia Lake,

133
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,090
and to the east of that is a forest 
that currently conceals Elves.

134
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,080
We still don't know their exact number.

135
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,100
But considering the Kingdom's 
forces, we estimate 100 at most.

136
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,680
A hundred?

137
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,260
That's not much for an army.

138
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,120
It's a number not worth considering.

139
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,240
However, their specialty is hiding 
in trees to ambush enemies.

140
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:58,460
If I were to send troops into that 
forest where the Elves lie in wait,

141
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,780
I would lose many men.

142
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:06,760
Having my men die needlessly 
is the one thing I hate most.

143
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,000
And that's why you're using me?

144
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,200
If you'd just hand over the princess,

145
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,010
there'd be no need for that.

146
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,990
I refuse!

147
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,300
Princess Shera,

148
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,600
what do you seek so ardently that you 
would abandon your life of luxury

149
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,100
and brave danger to disguise 
yourself as an adventurer?

150
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,650
I...

151
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,830
I wanted a reason to be myself.

152
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,850
One that wasn't my bloodline.

153
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,780
I wanted to know what I'm worth on my own.

154
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,610
I don't think I could ever 
find that in the Elven nation.

155
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,920
I see.

156
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,230
You understand?

157
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,720
I couldn't possibly empathize with that.

158
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,330
But I'll retain the knowledge of it.

159
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,420
I see...

160
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,800
We don't need empathy from others.

161
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,280
We face hardships as we please,

162
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,130
put forth our efforts where we please,

163
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,240
challenge our limits as we please,

164
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,190
and savor the successes we 
achieve by our own strength.

165
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,830
When you're following a 
path you chose yourself,

166
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,820
you mustn't be led astray,
no matter what others may say.

167
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,980
That's what it means to live free.

168
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,010
Then you won't be handing 
Princess Shera over.

169
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,580
So you'll be taking measures to prevent
war with the Kingdom of Greenwood.

170
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,180
Do I understand you correctly?

171
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,040
Shera to belongs to me anyway.

172
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,300
There's no room for others to get involved.

173
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,090
Then I leave it to you.

174
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,510
Oh, right.

175
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:42,960
Someone was dispatched from
the royal capital about this matter.

176
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,410
Let me introduce you.

177
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,880
I am Alicia Cristela, an Imperial Knight.

178
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,370
I have received orders from His Royal 
Majesty to address this matter.

179
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,870
<i>An Imperial Knight?</i>

180
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,040
It is an honor to meet you.

181
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,990
<i>An Imperial Knight...</i>

182
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,880
<i>Alicia Cristela?</i>

183
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,460
<i>In </i>Cross Reverie<i>, only powerful people with
a lineage could become Imperial Knights.</i>

184
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,760
<i>They're supposed to be 
the elite of the elite.</i>

185
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,950
<i>Was there a character like her in the game?</i>

186
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:27,900
It's extremely rare to see an
Imperial Knight who's a woman.

187
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,270
I thought they were all men.

188
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:35,400
Fortunately for me, I serve as an 
Imperial Knight despite being a woman.

189
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,280
That's wonderful.

190
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,280
No, I still have a long way to go.

191
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,530
What about you, Rem-sama?

192
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,790
You seem to be worrying 
about something yourself.

193
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,960
What made you think that?

194
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,040
I'm sorry.

195
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,420
It was just a guess.

196
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,020
According to the reports, 
you're a talented Summoner,

197
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,180
but you aren't working under anyone.

198
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,180
So I figured there must 
be some reason for that.

199
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,490
I see.

200
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,100
If there's anything I can help you with,

201
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,240
please feel free to talk to me about it.

202
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,560
Thank you very much.

203
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,320
Sylvie-sama...

204
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,490
His Majesty sent this as reparations.

205
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,820
Reparations?

206
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,200
Since you lost many adventurers 
in that incident the other day.

207
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,340
Oh...

208
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,330
Thanks.

209
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,940
Shera-sama!

210
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,790
I'm with you!

211
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,420
I'm sure we'll have a lot of 
trouble due to this matter,

212
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,660
but I'll do my best alongside 
you to make everyone happy!

213
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,670
Yeah!

214
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,930
She's crazy!!!

215
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,930
<i>She's crazy!</i>

216
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,390
<i>Her overwhelming communication 
skills let her converse perfectly</i>

217
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,930
<i>with someone she only just met!</i>

218
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:52,060
<i>As a person, her level is a whole 
</i>universe<i> higher than scum like me!</i>

219
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,160
Diablo-sama...

220
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,410
I cannot express enough gratitude 
and respect to you for defending

221
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,570
the Bridge of Ulug and Faltra 
from the Fallen's attack.

222
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,590
I'm sure you have no need of my aid,

223
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,830
but please permit me to 
accompany you nonetheless!

224
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,710
<i>C-C-C-C-C-C-Crap!</i>

225
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,920
<i>She's </i>too<i> perfect as a person!</i>

226
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,220
<i>If I'm not careful, she might see
through my Demon Lord act!</i>

227
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,460
Frankly, I don't want her to talk to me!

228
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,790
Do as you please.

229
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,970
However!

230
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,600
If you don't want to die,
then don't speak to me frivolously.

231
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,570
Then I shall prepare myself for that.

232
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,590
Huh?

233
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,980
If that is enough to quell 
your rage, Diablo-sama,

234
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,860
then I shall not begrudge you my life!

235
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,160
<i>Sh-Sh-Sh-ShShShShSh...</i>

236
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,060
<i>She's so diligent!</i>

237
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,260
Diablo-sama, where are we heading?

238
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,490
We're not heading straight for 
the woods with the Elves, are we?

239
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,060
We're going to a weaponsmith before that.

240
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,880
A weaponsmith?

241
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:10,640
I don't think this city can offer a better 
staff than the one you have, Diablo.

242
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,670
Don't judge my actions by your standards.

243
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,390
I have a plan.

244
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,310
<i>This was true in our last battle, too,</i>

245
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:24,490
<i>but the residents of this world are just 
too low-level compared to the game.</i>

246
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,490
<i>It's not going to end well</i>

247
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,580
<i>if I accidentally kill my opponents 
in front of an Imperial Knight,</i>

248
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,940
<i>so I need to buy a weapon that makes 
it easier for me to go easy on them.</i>

249
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,000
Welcome!

250
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,210
Thank you so much!

251
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,570
You... bought a pretty incredible one.

252
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,260
I focused on its appearance 
and ability to deal with small fry.

253
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,970
Since that's what I want!

254
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,170
It... suits you well.

255
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,000
What are we doing after this?

256
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,070
Well, next, I guess we'll buy ingredients 
for potions at an item shop.

257
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,040
It would be nice if we didn't need to fight,

258
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,740
but it's always best to be 
prepared for any outcome.

259
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,490
Hurry!

260
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,940
Shera-sama, if you run 
around too much, you'll trip.

261
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,000
<i>She's like a mom.</i>

262
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,080
Wha...

263
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,020
What?!

264
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,120
No! Let go!

265
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,800
Shera-sama?!

266
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,050
Bounty hunters?!

267
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,360
You're not getting by us!

268
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,280
You can play with us for a bit.

269
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,060
What did you say?!

270
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,780
Move!

271
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,830
T-Too strong...

272
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,420
That wasn't lethal, was it?

273
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,270
Well?!

274
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:02,920
Huh?

275
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,700
<i>Good, I can hold back on them.</i>

276
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,420
<i>I made the right choice with this weapon!</i>

277
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,300
Why, you!

278
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,680
I won't allow you to get 
in Diablo-sama's way!

279
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,900
Tsk...

280
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,060
I'm surprised.

281
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:26,400
I didn't think fools tempted by the 
bounty would show up this soon.

282
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,820
Are you prepared for this?

283
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,470
Please leave them to me!

284
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,070
Right.

285
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,420
Shera!

286
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,920
No!

287
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,760
I hear something approaching us, Nii-san!

288
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,060
What is this sound, little brother?!

289
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,100
Help me!

290
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,100
Shera!

291
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,950
Wait for me, Shera!

292
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,020
I'm catching up now!

293
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,320
Diablo!

294
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,400
What?!

295
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,230
He's fast, Nii-san!

296
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,030
He is fast, little brother!

297
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:15,290
But we can't let ourselves get 
captured after coming this far!

298
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,380
Double Smash!

299
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,380
I'll never allow wickedness to
befall women in this city!

300
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,480
You're...

301
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,630
It's been a while, friend.

302
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,030
My name is Emile Bichel Berger.

303
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:43,020
I am the ally of all women and allies of women!

304
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,770
Thanks, Emile.

305
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,770
You saved me.

306
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,280
Still, I'm surprised you were 
passing through this back alley.

307
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,530
Well...

308
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,740
I've kept it quiet so far,

309
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,030
but I can smell the very scent
of a woman in trouble!

310
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,700
Just don't do anything 
to get yourself arrested.

311
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,160
I kid, I kid!

312
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:10,280
I actually heard from the Adventurer's Guild
that Prince Keera put out a bounty.

313
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,260
So I was searching for 
Shera-chan to protect her.

314
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,420
Makes sense.

315
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,240
As for me personally,

316
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,350
I'd like to repay you for 
saving me the other day.

317
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,950
By the way,

318
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,960
what are you planning to do with them?

319
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,190
They may have failed,
but they're still kidnappers.

320
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,440
There's an Imperial Knight with us, too.

321
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,320
Leave these men to me.

322
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,570
I need to eliminate those who would 
make women cry from this world.

323
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,320
Will you kill them?

324
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,330
Perish the thought.

325
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,830
I'll just pound the preciousness of women

326
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,430
into them until they understand it 
from the bottoms of their hearts!

327
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,040
I'll turn them into honest people who would

328
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,800
never make the mistake of 
trying to kidnap women!

329
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,090
<i>Harsh!</i>

330
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,220
Now then, I'll be heading off,

331
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,580
but this won't be the last of 
those blinded by the bounty.

332
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,830
Please be careful.

333
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,480
Later, Emile!

334
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,480
You have my gratitude.

335
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,230
I nearly allowed my charge to be kidnapped.

336
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,320
You have my sincere gratitude.

337
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,760
My goodness! It seems I've 
charmed another woman.

338
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,990
What a sinful man I am.

339
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,710
I think Emile's a good guy, 
but I'm not charmed by him.

340
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,750
He's not a bad person,

341
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,810
but I'd rather avoid getting 
too involved with him.

342
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,820
Shera...

343
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,130
What?

344
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,320
Don't stray from me.

345
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,260
Stay by my side.

346
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,510
Huh? I can?

347
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,570
It'd be a hassle if you got kidnapped again.

348
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,080
Can...

349
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,980
Can I... hold your hand?

350
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,480
Yes.

351
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,280
Listen...

352
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,920
Thanks for saving me.

353
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,170
Emile is the one who saved you.

354
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:06,610
But you're the one who took 
out their companions, right?

355
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,210
I was really scared,

356
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,440
but when I saw you chasing after me,

357
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,500
I felt relieved.

358
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,750
Don't rest easy before you've been saved.

359
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,350
You're too optimistic.

360
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,550
That's too close!

361
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,720
But it's dangerous if I'm 
away from you, right?

362
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,220
Still...

363
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,800
I'm surprised.

364
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,140
You're that strong even 
without using your magic?

365
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,190
Impressive.

366
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,690
Th-That's only natural.

367
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,730
I'm no mere Sorcerer, after all.

368
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,300
I'm the Demon Lord.

369
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,950
Yes!

370
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,580
My apologies, Diablo-sama.

371
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:52,680
Shera-sama was endangered 
due to my inattention.

372
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,480
How can I make it up to you?

373
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,010
That's not true!

374
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,710
I'm to blame for that!

375
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,000
You didn't do anything wrong, Alicia-san!

376
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,120
But...

377
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,840
You're misunderstanding.

378
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,980
I'm the Demon Lord Diablo.

379
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,060
I never desired your aid to begin with.

380
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:16,480
Th-Then how may I be of 
service to you, Diablo-sama?

381
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,480
<i>This girl is way too diligent.</i>

382
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,680
<i>Even if she is an Imperial Knight,</i>

383
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,900
<i>it'll be hard on her if 
she doesn't relax more.</i>

384
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,430
Are you one of those?

385
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:31,000
The type that thinks anyone 
who isn't useful should die?

386
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,870
Huh? That's not...

387
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,970
That's not true at all!

388
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:39,050
Then forgive yourself for being useless.

389
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,560
If you want to accompany us, 
do so as you please.

390
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,250
You don't need to insist 
on producing results.

391
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,640
Yes.

392
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,400
I, Alicia Cristela, shall henceforth
turn my greatest effort

393
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,650
toward forgiving myself when I'm not useful!

394
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,150
<i>That's all wrong!</i>

395
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,330
Well, shall we head to the 
forest with the Elves now?

396
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,760
Yeah, let's all do our best!

397
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,810
Good grief... You're so boorish.

398
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,300
That wasn't me!

399
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,600
It was Diablo, wasn't it?

400
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,880
Don't be foolish!

401
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,440
I'm not as gluttonous as you are!

402
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,020
Then who...

403
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,140
Shall we go grab a bite, Alicia-san?

404
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,620
I-I'm fine...

405
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,580
You know what they say about empty stomachs.

406
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,880
I-Is that so?

407
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,810
Hey, what should we eat?

408
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:45,630
Meat.

409
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,210
You always want that, Rem!

410
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,820
What would you like, Alicia-san?

411
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,290
I don't really...

412
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,190
Let's eat meat.

413
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:52,860
No!

414
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,140
I want fruit!

415
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,460
Don't fight, you fools!

416
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,160
You figured out a way 
to release our collars?!

417
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,590
It looks good on you.

418
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,990
Send my magic power into Shera!

419
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,270
Diablo, wait!

420
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,020
Episode Six
Slave Market

421
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,020
This feels incredible!
