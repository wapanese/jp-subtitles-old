1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,900
B is for Big surprise!

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,240
S is for Superb!

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,240
What is that?

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,550
The biscuit song!

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,750
C is for Cake!

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,740
<i>That has nothing to do with biscuits...</i>

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,250
T is for biscuiT!

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,710
Now, let's sing together!

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,000
Sing it with us!

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,430
Uh...

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,010
B is for Biscuit!

12
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,510
S is for Superb!

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,250
C is for Cake...

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,520
T is for biscuiT!

15
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,320
Now, let's sing together!

16
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,000
Episode Eleven
The Young Girl Awakens

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,870
So good!

18
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,500
These biscuits are so good!

19
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,460
Yum!

20
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,640
This muddy water's bitter!

21
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,760
Then have some of this.

22
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,260
It's cocoa.

23
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,750
Let's see...

24
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,670
This muddy water's sweet!

25
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,650
You've heard what's going on, right?

26
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,540
She's lost her memories, 
but Klem is the Demon Lord.

27
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,450
So what do you think?

28
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,880
A Demon Lord who loves biscuits 
and won't kill the mortal races

29
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,530
isn't the Demon Lord we all fear.

30
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,700
Oh?

31
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,020
I just heard about her and wanted 
to see what she was like, that's all.

32
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,600
I'll just watch and wait for now.

33
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,920
You did well, Rem-san.

34
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,480
No...

35
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,420
I caused you a lot of worry, too.

36
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,960
That was very good!

37
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,800
We shall come again!

38
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,180
I'm glad Celes-san understood.

39
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,910
Klem-chan isn't that dangerous, after all.

40
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,940
Yeah.

41
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,480
Given that Celes is the cornerstone 
of the barrier protecting Faltra,

42
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,790
she can never leave this city.

43
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,790
So maybe she didn't want anyone else 
to lose their freedom without reason

44
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,100
and go through an experience 
similar to her own.

45
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,700
Hear that, Rem?

46
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,250
Huh?

47
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,350
They were all just here.

48
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,150
Alicia-san, where are we going?

49
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,880
We left Diablo and Shera behind.

50
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,410
To be honest,

51
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:11,800
I was just planning to bring Klem-sama, 
and then bring Shera-sama later.

52
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,850
But that's all right.

53
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,180
I can't be sure what might 
serve as the key, anyway.

54
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,730
Key?

55
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,880
They're not back here...

56
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,250
I'll go look for them.

57
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,000
You wait here so we don't 
miss them if they come back.

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,120
Okay.

59
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,750
<i>What is this odd stirring in my chest?</i>

60
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,190
Why are you missing your memories, Klem-sama?

61
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,880
Where's all this coming from?

62
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,150
One of the Fallen priests said it 
takes more than just magic power

63
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,640
to resurrect a Demon Lord.

64
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,270
A Fallen did?

65
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:00,780
So what can we do restore the Demon Lord's 
memories and completely awaken her?

66
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,150
Hold on a moment!

67
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,760
Alicia-san, are you saying you 
want the Demon Lord to resurrect

68
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,780
and kill the mortal races?

69
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,540
Did I not just say that?

70
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,040
What's gotten into you?

71
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,170
Nothing.

72
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,290
I'm the same as I've always been.

73
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,610
It's just that...

74
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:25,020
I no longer need to pretend 
we're all friends.

75
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,240
What are you saying?

76
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,920
I have resurrected.

77
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,160
I'm perfect, complete, and whole right now.

78
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,560
But you won't kill the mortal races, right?

79
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,800
Enough! Do you want me to burn you up?!

80
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,480
Yes!

81
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,030
If that will awaken you, Demon Lord!

82
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,000
Being the first to be burned to death

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,990
would be an utmost blessing if that meant

84
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,320
ridding this rotten world of the ugly 
mortal races and making it beautiful!

85
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,330
No...

86
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:57,040
So "that woman" Galluk 
mentioned back then...

87
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,250
<i>Figures what that woman said was right.</i>

88
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,500
That woman?

89
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,740
It was me.

90
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,710
I'm the one who encouraged that man

91
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,760
and handed him Gregore-sama 
disguised as a sword.

92
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,410
He was such a pathetic man, too.

93
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,560
A truly ugly being,

94
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,100
teeming with envy and hatred,
just like the mortal races themselves.

95
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,710
So there you are.

96
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,530
I've been looking for you 
for some time, Cristela-dono.

97
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,970
You're...

98
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,480
My apologies.

99
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,720
I was a bit held up...

100
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,020
by these Demon Lord worshipers.

101
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,540
You're the Demon Lord worshiper here!

102
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,960
Goodness, no!

103
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,240
My undercover investigation has revealed

104
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,170
that you all are Demon Lord worshipers,

105
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,560
so I just secured this young child that 
you all brought from who knows where!

106
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,920
That's the story you're running with?

107
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,810
So you are all Demon Lord 
worshipers, just as I suspected.

108
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,430
I see you're not a rock anymore.

109
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,440
That did surprise me.

110
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,650
I had never known such disgrace.

111
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,980
To think anyone would do 
something so insolent

112
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,030
to me, one with power granted by the Gods.

113
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,780
He'll need to be punished.

114
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,510
Come forth, Asulau!

115
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,660
Asulau! Please, break through them!

116
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,710
Be my shield.

117
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,300
Why do you obey orders that 
could get you killed?!

118
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,190
We only live because the Gods deem it proper.

119
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:40,140
Death simply means the Gods 
have invited us to Heaven.

120
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:49,190
But above all, protecting me is 
equivalent to protecting a God.

121
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,220
Cowards who would refuse 
to obey my orders out of fear

122
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,950
could never become squires.

123
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,460
Now, bow down before the power of God,

124
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,220
you infidel who worships the Demon Lord!

125
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,500
H-Hey...

126
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,030
Hatred is what she needs.

127
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,200
<i>Damn it!</i>

128
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,320
<i>I have a bad feeling about this!</i>

129
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,950
<i>Don't tell me that nagging 
feeling I had was because...</i>

130
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:42,980
You!

131
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,410
Hey, you!

132
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,790
Are you okay?

133
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,690
Klem! You're all right?!

134
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,660
Where are we?

135
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,760
Good grief!

136
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,290
You're pathetic, losing to someone like that.

137
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,100
Here.

138
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,820
Eat this.

139
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,940
Thank you.

140
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,570
It seems you've suffered because of me.

141
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,860
Alicia was talking about it.

142
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,160
She said you went through 
many hardships because of me.

143
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,060
That your mother, and her mother,
all the way back...

144
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,680
That's...

145
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,100
But you tried to save me.

146
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,120
You did the same thing with Eulerex, too.

147
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,350
The loyalty you've shown me 
is worthy of great praise.

148
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,950
It wasn't loyalty.

149
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,500
I don't understand it, either.

150
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,490
Why?

151
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,520
I thought I always hated 
the Demon Lord Krebskulm.

152
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:48,000
I gave up many things,
kept my distance from others,

153
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,140
and lived my life in fear and isolation.

154
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,150
So then why,

155
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,870
when my enemy is right here before my eyes,

156
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,660
can't I bring myself to want you gone?

157
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,410
Because of me, you were never free.

158
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,170
It's only natural that you'd hate me.

159
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,670
Having no freedom is painful.

160
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,180
You were sealed and all alone 
for the same amount of time

161
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,060
that my whole family spent 
suffering, weren't you?

162
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,010
It's more like I was half-asleep 
the whole time, really.

163
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:30,200
All because you were born a Demon Lord?

164
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,010
It's true, I was born a Demon Lord.

165
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,820
Maybe you're not that 
different from me, then.

166
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,330
Rem?

167
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,550
That's exactly why I want to protect you.

168
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,880
I won't let Alicia have her way.

169
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,870
You said it!

170
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:53,240
I already told her I'm complete, 
perfect, and whole as I am!

171
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,840
Let's get back to the others.

172
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,680
If it's okay to use my powers, 
I can break this iron cage

173
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,700
and turn those armored goons 
to ash with a single blow.

174
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,210
You can't do that.

175
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,990
Please stay the way you 
have been, eating biscuits,

176
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,110
laughing with everyone, 
and singing with Shera.

177
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,970
That's what I wish for you.

178
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,540
I don't want you to kill 
any of the mortal races.

179
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,470
Please don't ever forget that.

180
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,780
I don't really understand,

181
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,280
but it's a promise!

182
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
Well, we're here.

183
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,500
This is where we'll save you.

184
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,980
I'm not a Demon Lord worshiper!

185
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,740
I won't give you a false confession, 
even if you torture me!

186
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,100
That's good.

187
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,930
Everyone who's heard the rumors about me 
starts spewing shallow vows of repentance

188
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,780
as soon as they see these tools.

189
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,100
Though, of course,

190
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,140
they don't fool me.

191
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,680
You are a true Demon Lord worshiper,

192
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,800
trying to deceive us holy men to the end.

193
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,180
You intend to torture me 
no matter what, don't you?

194
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,900
This is your salvation.

195
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,810
I shall cleanse your tainted soul 
and release you unto Heaven.

196
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,100
Do you think you've become 
a God or something?

197
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,320
You're right.

198
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,200
The truth is...

199
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,320
It seems that I am a God.

200
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,760
I was born into a blessed family,

201
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,610
I was granted a blessed body,

202
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,080
and I boast a blessed intellect.

203
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,180
I received all of the blessings of Heaven,

204
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,460
so the only explanation is that I am a God 
descended from Heaven to save this world.

205
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,030
There's no point in saying 
anything to you, then!

206
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,580
Those ears of yours are evil.

207
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,160
That tail is bad, too.

208
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,160
As are those hands, which dared
to cast a Summon at me.

209
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,230
You're going to Hell!

210
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,580
Your mouth is evil, too.

211
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,860
Shall I extract your teeth, as well?

212
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,350
Alicia!

213
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,030
What made you want to 
cooperate with this man?

214
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,860
And to betray us, no less?!

215
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,480
I have my own goal.

216
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,290
If you don't like pain,

217
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,560
why don't you try pleading for help?

218
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,250
Don't you need my help?

219
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,040
I don't need it!

220
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,630
Please, keep our promise.

221
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,000
R-Right...

222
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,260
Your goal of resurrecting the Demon 
Lord to wipe out the mortal races?

223
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,100
That's why you need to do all this?!

224
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,520
What a funny thing for a
Demon Lord worshiper to say.

225
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,150
So was the understanding you showed me

226
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:01,620
and the fact that you went with us to 
rescue Shera all a bunch of lies, as well?!

227
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,770
Saddler-sama, may I leave 
the rest in your hands?

228
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,140
Yes, please leave it to me.

229
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,660
Alicia!

230
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,750
Now, shall we get started?

231
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,540
Damn it!

232
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,100
Seriously, where did they go?

233
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,300
I need something...

234
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,630
Any kind of clue...

235
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,280
You testing me, punk?!

236
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,020
Like taste-testing?! That's disgusting!

237
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,760
Oh, you think that's funny?!

238
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,270
Oh, right!

239
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:48,060
Then I was surrounded by 
a hundred scoundrels, so I...

240
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,350
Diablo-san?

241
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,540
Is something the matter, friend?

242
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,140
You two!

243
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,460
<i>Wait, how would a Demon Lord ask for a favor?</i>

244
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,640
<i>Ordering people around is easy...</i>

245
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,840
<i>But even with my poor communication 
skills, I still know it's not good</i>

246
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,900
<i>to ask a favor with that attitude.</i>

247
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,880
<i>If I were in their shoes, I wouldn't 
lend someone like that a hand.</i>

248
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,970
<i>I can't use my Demon Lord act here!</i>

249
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,230
A-Actually...

250
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:23,450
Rem... and... K-Klem are...

251
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,880
<i>Damn it!</i>

252
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:30,240
<i>Can I not even talk to these two 
without using my Demon Lord act?!</i>

253
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,740
Friend,

254
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,110
you're acting like a different person.

255
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,780
Guildmaster!

256
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,870
Big trouble!

257
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,540
My friend said he saw a Paladin 
carrying Rem-san away!

258
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,330
What?!

259
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,130
Rem-chan?!

260
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,810
Was it only Rem?!

261
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:47,690
Huh?

262
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,390
Was there anyone else with her?!

263
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,180
He said there was one more, a little girl.

264
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,690
He said they went into the 
church in the North District.

265
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:55,890
Thanks!

266
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,630
Did he just say "thanks"?

267
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,670
Our Diablo-san?

268
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,260
We can't stay here!

269
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,480
I'm going out to rescue Rem-chan, too!

270
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,280
All right!

271
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,390
I gotta make it in time!

272
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,490
What?!

273
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,420
Those are all Fallen, you say?!

274
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,640
Send a messenger to Lady Baudelaire at once!

275
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,930
Tell her to secure the barrier!

276
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:26,670
Yes, sir!

277
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,670
What is about to happen here?

278
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,870
We cannot let them enter Faltra.

279
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,810
I must protect the barrier, no matter what!

280
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,900
You can scream as much as you like.

281
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,720
No one will hear you.

282
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,830
Do you have no conscience at all?

283
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,290
I do.

284
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,800
My heart aches when I don't bring 
salvation to Demon Lord worshipers.

285
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,130
Don't move!

286
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,720
Rem!

287
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,710
No!

288
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,770
You promised me, Klem!

289
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:14,760
Don't!

290
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,500
But... But...

291
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,550
Did you not understand that 
you were told not to move?!

292
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,860
Rem!

293
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,540
Why are you just letting them hurt you?!

294
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,640
I'll kill them!

295
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,860
You don't mind, right?!

296
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,820
Don't...

297
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,110
You'll die!

298
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,160
If you interfere,

299
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,830
I'll show no mercy, 
even if you are a child.

300
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,200
A F-Fallen!

301
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,890
I'll turn you all... into ash!

302
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,240
Tsk. Damn Fallen!

303
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,280
Pretending to be a Human child!

304
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,570
How repulsive!

305
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:11,020
You'll pay with your life for hurting Rem!

306
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,780
Damn Fallen brat!

307
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,120
Rem? Rem!

308
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,060
Rem?! Hey! Hang in there!

309
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,630
Run... away...

310
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,210
You, too! I'll take you with me!

311
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:42,050
I'll kill these men and save you!

312
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,390
You... promised...

313
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,550
I-I did, but...

314
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,270
Damn demihuman, getting in my way!

315
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,550
What?!

316
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:28,500
<i>So that's... what she meant.</i>

317
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,260
Hatred is what she needs.

318
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,610
<i>So because of me...</i>

319
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,500
<i>I'm sorry, Klem.</i>

320
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,880
Finally, the moment of resurrection.

321
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,700
Now the ugly mortal races will perish.

322
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,690
No...

323
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,210
Impossible!

324
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,010
The Demon Lord has resurrected?!

325
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Even if you are the Demon Lord,

326
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,480
I'll wipe you out, leaving not a trace behind,
using the powers of the Gods that I command!

327
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,230
For I am a God myself!

328
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,200
Now, suffer!

329
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,870
And kneel before a God!

330
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,680
M-My eyes!

331
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,060
Saddler-sama?!

332
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,360
No...

333
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,680
It can't be!

334
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,750
Why?!

335
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,690
Am I... not a God?

336
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,640
What?!

337
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,990
Was I too late?!

338
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,200
Klem!

339
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,130
Diablo!

340
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,590
Shera?!

341
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,770
Why are you here?!

342
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,840
I used Turkey Shot to search for everyone,

343
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,300
and I saw Rem!

344
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,790
Rem...

345
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,550
Rem is...

346
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,780
What?! Rem is...

347
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,080
What happened to Alicia?!

348
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,480
I don't know!

349
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,630
I see.

350
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,060
Take these.

351
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,770
I'm going to hold Klem off.

352
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,280
You go save Rem.

353
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,190
All right.

354
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,090
Please don't get hurt.

355
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:47,030
And save Klem-chan!

356
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,070
Who do you think you're speaking to, Shera?

357
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,260
I am the true Demon Lord, 
summoned from another world!

358
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,310
Leave this to me!

359
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,960
I'll take care of it all!

360
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,190
You can't die here, Rem!

361
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:37,240
This attack should wake you up, Klem!

362
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,980
