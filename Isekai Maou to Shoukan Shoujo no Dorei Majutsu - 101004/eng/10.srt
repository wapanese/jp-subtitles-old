1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,020
You're finally here.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,750
Were you waiting long?

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,770
Not really.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,740
<i>This brings back memories.</i>

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,010
<i>It's where I was summoned.</i>

6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,880
I've already drawn the magic circle.

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,030
Preparations for the ritual are done.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,280
Oh, this is Alicia.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,670
I've allowed her to accompany 
us for certain reasons,

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,790
but she won't interfere.

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,620
<i>That's surprising.</i>

12
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,700
<i>I thought she'd be more opposed.</i>

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:40,250
Is this ritual meant to fill 
Krebskulm's soul with magic power?

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,340
Yes.

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,810
You'll pour strong magic power 
into the Demon Lord's soul.

16
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,820
That should hasten her resurrection, I think.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,510
Diablo,

18
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,750
I can't trust the Fallen.

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,090
Do you want to call this off?

20
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,450
No.

21
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,330
I want to defeat Krebskulm.

22
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,840
I believe in you, Diablo.

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,330
Please...

24
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,710
Save me from this fate.

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,500
Today is the day I fulfill 
my promise to you, Rem!

26
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,520
Episode Ten
Demon Lord's Resurrection

27
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,030
Let's begin the ritual right away.

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,140
You'll pour your magic power into the soul

29
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,530
of the Demon Lord in her stomach.

30
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,880
That will resurrect the Demon Lord.

31
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,340
I never imagined there would come a day

32
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,040
when I entered a magic 
circle drawn by a Fallen

33
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,730
to pour magic power into the Demon Lord.

34
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,550
Here I go.

35
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,110
Yes. Please start.

36
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,470
<i>I see it!</i>

37
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,440
<i>So this is Krebskulm's magic power!</i>

38
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,690
It's hot!

39
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,900
Diablo is... pouring into me!

40
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,080
Well?

41
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,330
You're not even close.

42
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,830
The Demon Lord is even deeper in.

43
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,030
You're not reaching her.

44
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,710
What?!

45
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,290
Make a hole in her stomach,

46
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,060
and do it from much closer.

47
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,340
If you do that, Rem will die!

48
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,130
There is a hole.

49
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:07,850
What?

50
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,080
Where?!

51
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,850
Here.

52
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,730
Huh?

53
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,730
Huh?

54
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,730
Huh?

55
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,730
Insert your fingers into that hole.

56
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,110
<i>My fingers?!</i>

57
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,560
<i>No, no!</i>

58
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,410
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Hold on! That's not okay!</i>

59
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,120
<i>That is </i>really<i> not okay!</i>

60
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,090
<i>My mind isn't ready for that!</i>

61
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,700
<i>I mean, of course, I've steeled 
myself for saving Rem.</i>

62
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,220
<i>Butâ€”really?!</i>

63
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,130
<i>Aren't there all kinds of
issues with that visual?!</i>

64
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,320
All right.

65
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,010
What?!

66
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,180
Please do it...

67
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,260
If that's what it takes.

68
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,360
I'm not sure I understand,

69
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,750
but hang in there!

70
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,390
<i>She's telling me to do it?!</i>

71
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,980
Please save me, Diablo!

72
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,090
Diablo!

73
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,170
Diablo's entering me!

74
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,930
<i>Focus!</i>

75
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,960
<i>I'm still a long way away from Krebskulm!</i>

76
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,560
<i>She's deeper inside!</i>

77
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,190
<i>I see it!</i>

78
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,930
<i>What incredible intensity...</i>

79
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,080
<i>There's no mistake.</i>

80
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,440
<i>This is the magic power 
of Demon Lord Krebskulm!</i>

81
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,720
Here I go!

82
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,530
Take my magic power inside you!

83
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,910
Please, Diablo!

84
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,990
The Demon Lord is reborn!

85
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,120
This is bad!

86
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,590
We can't let this thing be reborn!

87
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,410
Are you all right?

88
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,640
Hang in there!

89
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,500
Diablo...

90
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,630
Please win.

91
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,150
Of course I will!

92
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,510
And you have a responsibility 
to bear witness to it!

93
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,820
So you're not allowed to die!

94
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,410
Incredible!

95
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,520
This...

96
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,270
This is the Demon Lord!

97
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,420
Huh?

98
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,540
Where's Krebskulm?

99
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,020
Are you the ones who woke 
me from my slumber?

100
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,470
Demon Lord!

101
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,180
<i>The Demon Lord?! That's her?!</i>

102
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,720
<i>That's Krebskulm?!</i>

103
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,810
Who are you?

104
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,760
I am Edelgard.

105
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,370
I'm overjoyed by your resurrection!

106
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,990
I see, I see.

107
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,440
You should indeed commend 
me on my resurrection!

108
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,450
Hey, are you really the Demon Lord Krebskulm?

109
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,720
Indeed.

110
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,970
I see.

111
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,210
You're not quite what I expected,
but that matters not.

112
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,360
My name is Diablo!

113
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,570
I am the Demon Lord from another world

114
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,470
and the one who shall bury you!

115
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,750
I see. So you're the one who woke me?

116
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,350
Good, good. As your reward,

117
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,980
I'll teach you what fear is!

118
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,920
I'll kill you in the most 
brutal way possible!

119
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,070
Yes! The most...

120
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:43,250
Uh, I know there's supposed 
to be a really brutal way...

121
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,000
What was it?

122
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,500
Huh?

123
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,030
<i>Hey, you're kidding, right?!</i>

124
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,780
<i>Has she forgotten how to fight?</i>

125
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,480
Argh, forget it!

126
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,390
I'll just burn everything to ash! 
That's what a Demon Lord would do, right?

127
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,330
You can't do that!

128
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,690
I can't?

129
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,390
Huh?

130
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,820
Demon Lord!

131
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,480
You're listening to what these mortals say?!

132
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,230
That's wrong!

133
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,800
But if they say I can't, doesn't it mean I can't?

134
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,120
<i>What's going on here?</i>

135
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,960
<i>Is she missing some of her 
memories or something?</i>

136
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,530
The Demon Lord is the one who 
destroys the mortal races!

137
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,350
Is that not true?!

138
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,730
Yes, I believe that sounds right.

139
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,910
Wait a minute!

140
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,150
Why do you?

141
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,390
I've always thought it was strange.

142
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,740
Why does the Demon Lord 
kill the mortal races?

143
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:36,170
I feel like there was some kind 
of reason for it, but.. um...

144
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,490
If you're not doing it of your own volition,

145
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,010
then please don't kill anymore!

146
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,510
I'm asking you, too!

147
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,770
Killing isn't good!

148
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,080
Well...

149
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,240
I can't remember why I'd 
kill them, so why not?

150
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,780
Okay, I won't kill them.

151
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,900
<i>Seriously?!</i>

152
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,600
Are you serious?!

153
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,140
You say the Demon Lord won't 
kill the mortal races?!

154
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,610
Killing the mortal races won't 
fill my stomach, anyway.

155
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,910
Edelgard!

156
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,840
Is this okay with you?!

157
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,100
The Demon Lord is all that matters to me.

158
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,050
If that's what the Demon Lord wants,

159
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,460
I'm fine with it.

160
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,200
More importantly, your Demon Lord is hungry!

161
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,180
Oh, I brought snacks.

162
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,590
Here.

163
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,220
What are these?

164
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,060
They're biscuits.

165
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,080
It's good!

166
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,160
I have more if you'd like.

167
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,530
These are so good!

168
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,390
I've never eaten anything this good before!

169
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,390
Thanks to these, I've remembered my mission!

170
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,690
To devour all the biscuits in this world!

171
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,210
That is the reason I have 
been reborn into this world!

172
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,340
<i>Like hell it is!</i>

173
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,640
Hey, are there no more biscuits?

174
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,600
My name's Shera.

175
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,760
Sorry, but there won't be any more 
until we return to the city.

176
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,440
Very well!

177
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,040
Then lead the way!

178
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,810
What?! You're going into the city?

179
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,170
You, the Demon Lord?!

180
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,830
Diablo, I can walk on my own now.

181
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,400
Please let me down.

182
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,970
You haven't regained your strength yet.

183
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,120
I refuse to slow down to match your pace.

184
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,330
I see.

185
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,630
Are you really able to accept this?

186
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,630
It's not easy to accept, no.

187
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,950
How many biscuits are there in the city?

188
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,260
Myself, my mother, my grandmother...

189
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,660
If you go into a store, there are lots!

190
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,580
We all suffered due to that Demon Lord,

191
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,120
More than you can eat!

192
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,620
Is that true?!

193
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,640
and spent our lives hoping 
to defeat Krebskulm.

194
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,640
Can I truly eat them all?!

195
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,310
It's just...

196
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,750
There's no need to fight her if she 
isn't going to kill the mortal races.

197
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,200
Assuming that's really true, anyway.

198
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,940
Diablo-sama! Above us!

199
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,530
Hmm? Above?

200
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,020
What's that?

201
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,410
Huh?

202
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,880
Demon Lord, congratulations 
on your resurrection.

203
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,580
Who are you?

204
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,130
I am Eulerex, the one who has served 
the Demon Lords for generations.

205
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,600
Eulerex?

206
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,510
<i>He was in </i>Cross Reverie<i>, too.</i>

207
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,800
Eulerex has been alive since the 
Demon Lord before the previous one.

208
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,270
He's the oldest and strongest among us.

209
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:41,710
I have long awaited the 
resurrection of our Demon Lord.

210
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:46,240
Allow me to offer a sacrifice to 
celebrate this auspicious day.

211
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,210
Auspicious?

212
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,030
Yes.

213
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,290
I would like to slaughter all the mortals
being kept alive here in your presence,

214
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,540
and offer their lives in 
celebration of your resurrection.

215
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,100
You can't!

216
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,300
If you kill the mortals,
I won't be able to eat biscuits!

217
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,920
Edelgard, the Demon Lord seems 
opposed to killing the mortal races.

218
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,430
What is the meaning of this?

219
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,810
I don't understand, either.

220
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,740
The Demon Lord is the 
ruler of all dark beings!

221
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,240
And dark beings kill the mortal races!

222
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,820
Which means...

223
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:29,160
I believe our incomplete Demon Lord
 needs to reincarnate again!

224
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,330
Edelgard?!

225
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,320
You act on your own!

226
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,460
Nothing is more important 
than our Demon Lord's will!

227
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,480
Even Fallen have a purpose in this world.

228
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,710
So I must correct this 
incomplete resurrection

229
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,180
of our Demon Lord!

230
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,010
Alicia!

231
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,310
Protect the girls!

232
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,100
Diablo!

233
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,920
I don't intend to get too close,

234
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,480
but they said he's the strongest Fallen.

235
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,800
Don't worry. I'll end this quickly.

236
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,640
Foolish Edelgard.

237
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,720
Do you think a weakling like you can beat me?

238
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,210
It's not right

239
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,500
for Fallen to turn on the Demon Lord!

240
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:22,110
A Demon Lord's soul is limited.

241
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:25,600
So long as this Krebskulm exists,

242
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,630
the true Krebskulm cannot be resurrected!

243
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,150
Your foolish actions

244
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:35,140
have brought about this incomplete 
resurrection of our Demon Lord!

245
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,940
You dodged that?

246
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,820
A mere Demon dares stand before a Fallen?

247
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,720
Hmph!

248
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,390
You may have lived a long life,

249
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,980
but it seems you're missing 
some important information!

250
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,950
I am Diablo!

251
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,360
You are the fool who dares 
stand before a true Demon Lord!

252
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,080
What?

253
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,630
<i>Just kidding.</i>

254
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,340
<i>There's no way he could know.</i>

255
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,460
<i>I'm just a player, after all!</i>

256
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,040
Flare Burst!

257
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,770
Yes!

258
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,720
Curse you!

259
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,350
Super Mine!

260
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,190
<i>This guy's fast!</i>

261
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,920
Quartz Lance!

262
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,320
Come!

263
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,360
Could that be...

264
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,580
Magic Reflection?

265
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,300
Oh? You figured out my 
power on the first shot?

266
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,480
It can't be!

267
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,550
Magic Reflection was the unique power

268
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,830
of the Demon Lord of the Mind, Enkvaros.

269
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,220
Why do you...

270
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,860
<i>Because I was the first person to 
defeat Enkvaros in the game.</i>

271
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,070
<i>I received this ring as a
reward for doing that.</i>

272
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:06,970
<i>It looks like living through 
two generations of Demon Lords</i>

273
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,480
<i>has left him with lots of knowledge.</i>

274
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,380
Hmph. Haven't you realized it yet?

275
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,740
No matter how much you struggle, 
there's no chance you'll win.

276
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,250
The incomplete Demon Lord must die!

277
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,420
Look out!

278
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,420
Lightning Bullet!

279
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,900
You tried to protect a Demon Lord?

280
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,080
Rem, are you all right?

281
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,900
Rem-sama!

282
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,030
No, I...

283
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,660
Good work!

284
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,680
You have my praise!

285
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,270
No, no.

286
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,450
At a time like this, you say, "Thank you."

287
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,680
Shera...

288
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,690
I see.

289
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,940
Thank you, then!

290
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,950
What immense magic power.

291
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,060
You're no ordinary mortal.

292
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,760
I told you, I'm the Demon Lord.

293
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,210
Have you gone senile on
top of being so ignorant?

294
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,800
It's inconceivable...

295
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,900
Yet your strength is abnormal.

296
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,500
I don't understand.

297
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,980
Are you sure it was wise to let him go?

298
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,640
I've lost interest.

299
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,780
I don't care about those who run from me.

300
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,760
<i>I could pursue him,</i>

301
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,540
<i>but if he used some area of effect
attack that wasn't magical,</i>

302
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,660
<i>I wouldn't be able to 
protect this many people.</i>

303
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,010
<i>I'd rather avoid putting everyone in danger.</i>

304
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,310
That delayed us far too long.

305
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,890
Let's make haste home.

306
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,690
The Bridge of Ulug should 
soon be coming into view.

307
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,900
Right!

308
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,050
Demon Lord...

309
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,770
If we're going to the Human city,

310
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,640
I can't get near it.

311
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,320
I'll wait in the forest.

312
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,700
Please call on me at any time.

313
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,310
Fine.

314
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,800
Good work.

315
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,640
Thank you.

316
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,940
It is my humble pleasure.

317
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,320
Um, about Krebskulm-sama...

318
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,300
I believe we'll face several problems if 
we use her name within the city, won't we?

319
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,980
True, it could cause unwanted chaos.

320
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,360
I am the Demon Lord,

321
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,850
but how you refer to me is a trivial 
matter when biscuits are at stake.

322
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,080
I'll permit something else.

323
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,100
In that case...

324
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,640
Oh, how about Klem-chan?

325
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,640
Are you okay?

326
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,520
What's the matter with him?

327
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,850
When Diablo uses his magic,
he gets tired and loses his energy.

328
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,520
Oh, yes. I've heard the mortal races 
get worn out when using magic power.

329
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,210
You don't, Klem-chan?

330
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,760
Because I'm a Demon Lord!

331
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,690
Infinite magic power constantly 
wells up from deep within me!

332
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:02,990
<i>That's cheating.</i>

333
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,220
What happened to Rem and Alicia?

334
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,430
Everyone couldn't sleep in here,

335
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,620
so they're both sleeping 
in Alicia-san's room.

336
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,680
I see.

337
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,500
Shera, you...

338
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,970
Rem's not here,

339
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:27,020
so I thought I'd help you get active again.

340
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,970
Wha... Wait! Hey!

341
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,560
You mortals are interesting.

342
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,650
That's how you give each other magic power?

343
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,850
Would you like to try too, Klem-chan?

344
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,400
Doing this helps you get active, too!

345
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,130
What?!

346
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,280
Even the one granting it gains energy?!

347
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,410
Let me see.

348
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,860
Hmm... Like this?

349
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,120
Uh-huh!

350
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,030
When you press against him 
like that, he gets active!

351
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,180
You're right!

352
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,670
This is fun for me, too!

353
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,630
<i>What is happening right now?!</i>

354
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,510
<i>This is bad!</i>

355
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,800
<i>It's shocking me!</i>

356
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,700
<i>Klem's pouring a ton of magic power into me!</i>

357
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,010
What's the matter?

358
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,310
Do you like this?

359
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,680
Diablo, how is it?

360
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,690
Are you feeling active?

361
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,570
<i>Damn it! Damn it!</i>

362
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,740
<i>I want to ogle them!</i>

363
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,570
<i>Just how different would my life have been</i>

364
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:24,660
<i>if I could just act confident 
in situations like this?!</i>

365
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,280
This is kind of amazing!

366
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,040
Something's coming from deep within me!

367
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:34,920
It feels like it does when his 
magic power's pouring into me!

368
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:52,270
<i>My Magic Points are fully recovered.</i>

369
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,110
<i>The Demon Lord's incredible.</i>

370
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,320
<i>My, metal on a woman's face?</i>

371
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,400
<i>That's shameful. Take them off.</i>

372
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,450
<i>I saw you had books that were 
inappropriate to your education.</i>

373
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,140
So I threw them out.

374
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,480
It's for your own good.

375
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,720
<i>When an emergency arises, 
protect Humans first.</i>

376
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,600
<i>Demihumans can come afterward.</i>

377
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,260
Sometimes sacrifices are necessary 
for the prosperity of the nation.

378
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,650
Do you understand?

379
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,060
<i>Alicia!</i>

380
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,970
I need the Demon Lord to fulfill 
the Demon Lord's duty.

381
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,060
She must rid this world 
of the mortal races

382
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,190
in order to create a beautiful world.

383
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,340
Are you all right, Saddler-sama?

384
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,320
How are you feeling?

385
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,320
Obviously not good.

386
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,400
I feel awful.

387
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,950
The Gods would never enjoy the 
existence of an insolent man

388
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,200
who doesn't believe in my power.

389
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,900
I'll never forgive

390
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,960
those damn demihumans!

391
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,280
You're saying the Demon Lord has revived?!

392
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,850
The ugly mortal races will perish.

393
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,980
Episode Eleven
The Young Girl Awakens

394
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,980
I'm sorry, Klem.
