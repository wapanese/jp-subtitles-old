Elite Disciple Dorms
Training Hall

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,600
May 17, 380 in the time
of the realm of humanity

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,940
In this world, the important thing
is what you infuse your sword with.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,950
It's the weight of your sword
that will sway the battle.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,410
Its weight?

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,870
That's right.

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,620
For Volo Levantein,

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,790
it was the pride and pressure of being born
into a family of swordsmanship instructors.

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,750
For Golgorosso-senpai, it's the confidence
generated by his body of steel.

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,970
And for Liena-senpai,
it was her thoroughly polished skills.

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,300
That is what makes their swords so powerful.

12
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,010
I wonder what I should infuse in my sword?

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,980
That's something you need to find on your own.

14
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,650
<i>I'm neither a noble nor a swordsman,</i>

15
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:51,730
<i>so I have nothing except those years
swinging an axe in the Rulid forest</i>

16
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,570
<i>and the Aincrad style that Kirito taught me.</i>

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,160
<i>No, actually, there's one more thing.</i>

18
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,010
Nobleman's Responsibilities

19
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:54,520
Oh? Disciple Eugeo merely hacks at logs,
and forgoes any form drills, it seems.

20
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,900
Rumor has it that Sir Eugeo
used to be a woodcutter in the sticks.

21
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,910
Perhaps the extent of his knowledge
is how to attack a log.

22
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,620
Goodness gracious.

23
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:11,120
If that's the case, then as someone
who trains in the same dorm,

24
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,790
perhaps I should have at least
instructed him on the proper form?

25
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:21,590
Ah, how generous of you, Lord Raios.
You're truly an exemplary knight!

26
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,390
What do you say, Sir Eugeo?

27
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,720
Why don't you accept the generosity
of Lord Raios and have him train you?

28
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,520
It's a once in a lifetime opportunity.

29
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,980
I appreciate it, but...

30
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,440
There's a separate reason
for the upperclassmen's power.

31
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,700
Is that true of First-Seat Raios
and Second-Seat Humbert, as well?

32
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,870
What those two share is the enormous conceit
that they've fostered since childhood.

33
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,910
Conceit?

34
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,630
Raios and Humbert probably nurtured that
conceit by comparing themselves to others.

35
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:02,590
That's why they look down on guys like us,
who aren't from the capital, let alone nobles.

36
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,720
<i>This might be a great opportunity
to see this conceit that strengthens them.</i>

37
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,850
Then if I may accept your generosity,
would you honor me with a lesson?

38
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,770
Well, well. Are you serious?

39
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,770
Yes.

40
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:24,530
If you could advise me directly with your sword
onto my body, Second-Seat Lord Humbert Zizek.

41
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,330
What's that?

42
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:35,710
Are you saying that you want to be hit
by Lord Humbert's sword, Disciple Eugeo?

43
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,920
Of course,
I would prefer that you stopped short,

44
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,460
but I am the one who is asking to be trained.

45
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,930
It would be forward of me to make such a request.

46
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,640
Very well.

47
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,180
I'll be glad to unveil my sword skills to you,
Disciple Eugeo.

48
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,980
Now then, let's go!

49
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,440
The essence of the High-Norkian style...

50
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,020
You will absorb this lesson with your body.

51
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,530
<i>That's the Norkian style secret move,
Lightening Slash...</i>

52
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,110
Here I come!

53
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,340
<i>If it's a test of strength,
then I have the upper hand!</i>

54
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,010
Don't get carried away, you commoner!

55
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,140
<i>What's this power?</i>

56
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,430
<i>Is this the strength
that his conceit generates?</i>

57
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,650
You are so unsightly,
oozing with the lowliness of your style.

58
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,570
I'll crush your right shoulder
so you can't swing that sword for a while.

59
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,660
<i>I have to switch techniques!</i>

60
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,920
That's the match.

61
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,800
I'm declaring this match a draw.

62
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,300
Lord Raios! How could I merely play to a draw
with a swordsman from the sticks?

63
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:13,760
Humbert.

64
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:27,900
Your outlandish moves
were greatly entertaining, Disciple Eugeo.

65
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,120
After graduating, perhaps you should consider
seeking a Calling with the Empire Circus?

66
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:38,250
I am humbled by your thoughtfulness,
Disciple Raios Antinous.

67
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,340
Next time, allow me to show you
the power of a noble.

68
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,590
I would be honored
to take that lesson right now.

69
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:52,890
Battle isn't only about swinging a sword,
commoner.

70
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,980
Elite Disciple
Dorms

71
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,980
May 20, 380 in the time
of the realm of humanity

72
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,400
It's been three days.

73
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,860
It feels weird that nothing's happened
after they hinted of mischief.

74
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,580
There's the Taboo Index
as well as the school regulations.

75
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,830
I guess it's not easy to harass someone here.

76
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,040
But on the other hand,

77
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,710
that means as long as you don't violate the Taboos,
you can do anything you want.

78
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,760
Don't violate the Taboos? But what could...

79
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:37,970
Well, they could be trying to get into our heads
by just hinting that they might do something.

80
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,480
So let's keep our heads straight. Let's stay cool.

81
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,730
What's that? S-Stay...

82
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,820
Um, that's the first innermost secret
of the Aincrad style.

83
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,700
I guess it's like, "Let's stay calm."

84
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,490
Though you also use it as a farewell.

85
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,660
Kind of like, "Okay, see you!"

86
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,540
All right. I'll keep that in mind.

87
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,250
S-Stay cool, stay cool.

88
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,130
All right, I guess I'll be going to bed now.

89
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,970
So about tomorrow, Eugeo.

90
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,850
I've got an errand to run, so...

91
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,510
Oh no you don't, Kirito!

92
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,890
We're spending tomorrow's Day of Rest
with Tiese and Ronie,

93
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:24,270
and heading into the campus forest
for a get-together, remember?

94
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,360
They're coming here at nine o'clock,
so make sure you're ready by then!

95
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,490
Okay.

96
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,990
Well, wake me up at eight, will you?
Good night, Eugeo.

97
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,990
Eight's too late. Seven-thirty!

98
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,910
Good night, Kirito!

99
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,910
Stay cool.

100
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:47,630
I did say it was a farewell greeting, but you don't
use it every night before you go to bed.

101
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,800
You should save it for a real goodbye, okay?

102
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,260
It's pretty complicated, huh?

103
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,060
<i>If what Kirito said is true,</i>

104
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:14,400
<i>then are Raios and Humbert
obeying the laws of the Axiom Church reluctantly?</i>

105
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,490
<i>But that's impossible.</i>

106
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,620
<i>It's forbidden by law
to even doubt the Taboo Index.</i>

107
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,830
<i>If they did allow something like that,
then that day...</i>

108
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,090
<i>When all I could do was watch Alice
get taken away...</i>

109
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,380
<i>What have I been protecting,
and for what purpose?</i>

110
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,350
Alice.

111
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,810
Eugeo-senpai, are you listening?

112
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,270
Senpai?

113
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,360
Sorry, I'm listening. Um, what were you saying?

114
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,860
So you weren't listening!

115
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,540
I-It's just that the forest
is so beautiful, so I couldn't help it.

116
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,000
There are rare animals here, too.

117
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,460
Rare?

118
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,330
Look, like over there.

119
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:16,970
That's just a golden fox. There are tons of them
living in trees growing in the city.

120
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,430
Come to think of it, Tiese,
you're from the capital, right?

121
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,300
Yes.

122
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,100
Is your home nearby?

123
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,770
My parents' home is in District Eight,

124
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,600
so it's a little far from the academy,
which is in District Five.

125
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,100
I see.

126
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:37,490
So, Tiese, you come from a noble family, right?

127
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,490
I thought all the nobles' mansions
were in District Three and Four.

128
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,950
Only nobles that are fourth rank and above
can live in the mansion district.

129
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:50,460
My father is a lower-level, sixth rank nobleman
who has no judicial authority.

130
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,920
But didn't all nobles have judicial authority?

131
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,170
Absolutely not!

132
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:58,880
Only nobles up to fourth rank
are allowed judicial authority,

133
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,720
and nobles ranked fifth and lower
are actually the subjects of their judgement.

134
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,680
I-Is that right?

135
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,350
Th-That's why...

136
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:15,860
someone like me, the heir to a sixth rank noble,
is an aristocrat in name only.

137
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,280
Our lifestyle is really no different
than most people.

138
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,870
When faced with a High-Norkian style strike
from above the head,

139
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,710
there are basically
two things you need to prepare for.

140
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:35,920
It's either from directly above,
or diagonally above to the right.

141
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,420
If it's any other trajectory,
they'll change their footing for sure,

142
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,760
so after seeing that,
you'll still have time to block it.

143
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,930
That was good!

144
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,810
Um, Eugeo-senpai, Kirito-senpai?

145
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,650
I actually have a favor to ask of you.

146
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,440
It's about Frenica, my roommate at my dorm.

147
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,990
The thing is, the Elite Disciple whom she
serves under is an extremely strict person.

148
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,870
Especially in the last few days,

149
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,790
he's been giving her orders
that are thought to be quite inappropriate.

150
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,130
Even if he's an Elite Disciple,

151
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,590
he shouldn't be able to order her to do a task
beyond the scope of the school regulations.

152
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:24,260
However, even if it's not a violation, um,

153
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,060
these orders are a bit intolerable
for a female student.

154
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,060
I understand the situation.

155
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,560
To change Frenica's mentor, she'll need
the approval of her current mentor himself.

156
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
What's the name of this troubling Disciple?

157
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:45,570
Um, Humbert Zizek.
The Second-Seat Elite Disciple.

158
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,990
Him again?

159
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:54,920
A few days ago, I dueled Disciple Humbert
in the Training Hall, and it ended in a draw.

160
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,460
But he seemed disgruntled by the result.

161
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,920
He may be taking it out on Frenica
because of that.

162
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,010
Um, in other words...

163
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,470
Do you mean it's retaliation?

164
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,970
I don't understand.

165
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,390
My father always said to me.

166
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:19,900
We live in a bigger house than general civilians,
and enjoy some privileges,

167
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,940
and we can never take that for granted.

168
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:29,120
Nobles must do all they can to ensure that those
not so privileged can live in peace and joy.

169
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:35,410
And if war ever breaks out,
we must be the first to take up our swords.

170
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,750
And yet, because of what Elite Disciple Humbert
ordered her to do,

171
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,260
Frenica ended up crying in bed all last night.

172
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:47,590
How can such a thing be allowed?

173
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,100
Thank you.

174
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,020
That attitude your father taught you, Tiese,

175
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:01,730
in Eng... no, in sacred terms,
it's called "noble obligation."

176
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:10,740
Nobles, that is, those with power
must use it for the sake of the powerless.

177
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,200
Let's see, you could also call it pride.

178
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,330
And that pride
is more important than any law or regulation.

179
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,460
After all, there are things that you shouldn't do,
even if it's not forbidden by law.

180
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,920
And on the other hand,

181
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,430
there might be things you should do,
even if they are forbidden by law.

182
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:37,640
Um, I think I understand
a little of what you're saying, Kirito-senpai.

183
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,360
There are important morals
that aren't described in the Taboo Index.

184
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,650
In other words,
your own personal justice, right?

185
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,910
Rather than simply obeying laws,
you need to consider why those laws exist.

186
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,370
Compare it with justice, and reflect.

187
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,750
Perhaps it's more important to critically think
about it, rather than simply obey.

188
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,920
Yeah, thatâ€™s exactly right, Ronie.

189
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,380
A human being's greatest power is to think.

190
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:07,010
It's more powerful
than any great sword or secret move.

191
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,260
Even if it doesn't violate
the Taboo Index or school rules,

192
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,010
what Humbert did is unquestionably wrong.

193
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,520
So somebody has to stop him.

194
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,690
In this case, that somebody would be...

195
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,610
Yeah. That would be our job.

196
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,280
And so...

197
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,200
my friend, Disciple Eugeo, to what do I owe

198
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,080
the pleasure of this visit
in the evening of our Day of Rest?

199
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:41,540
I happened to hear of a disturbing rumor
concerning Disciple Zizek there.

200
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,040
With all due respect, I've come to warn you,

201
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,960
before my fellow student's good reputation
is maligned.

202
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,510
What did you say?

203
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,050
Well, well.

204
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,550
This is quite surprising, and also unexpected.

205
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:58,770
To think that you'd be concerned
for my friend's good name.

206
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:04,310
Unfortunately,
I have no idea what rumor you speak of.

207
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,990
From whom did you hear this rumor from?

208
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,200
I heard it from Lord Zizek's page,
as well as from the Novice Trainees

209
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,830
who share her dorm room.

210
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:25,080
That Sir Humbert has been issuing
deviant orders to Frenica, his page Trainee.

211
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:30,550
Deviant?
That's a curious choice of word, Sir Eugeo.

212
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,050
Why don't you be more clear,
and call it a violation of the school regulations?

213
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,180
However...

214
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,270
However, even if it's not forbidden
by the academy,

215
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,150
there are things that an Elite Disciple should
never do as a Novice Trainee's mentor, right?

216
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:55,200
Oh? Well, Sir Eugeo, just what is it
that you claim Humbert did to Frenica?

217
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,030
W-Well...

218
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,990
What do you say, Humbert?

219
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,750
Do you have any idea
what Sir Eugeo is talking about?

220
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:10,840
Not a clue! I have no idea
of what he's going on about!

221
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:14,840
But I do admit that I ordered her
to perform several trivial tasks.

222
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,600
Ever since that duel against Sir Eugeo,
which shamefully ended in a draw,

223
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,890
I've become a new man,
and immersed myself in training.

224
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:28,150
And because I've avoided drills
that would give me unsightly muscles,

225
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,110
my entire body aches unbearably.

226
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:36,360
I had no choice but to ask Frenica to give me
a massage every night at bath time, that's all.

227
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:43,660
Also lest her uniform get soiled, I was kind enough
to allow Frenica to strip to her underwear!

228
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:49,840
It's unfathomable to me of which part
you consider to be deviant behavior!

229
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:57,380
Novice Trainee Frenica
is in anguish day in and day out.

230
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:03,430
If I don't see any improvement, I will consider
asking the instructors for an investigation.

231
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,770
- That's my intention.
- What?

232
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,230
Do as you please,

233
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,200
Disciple Sir Eugeo!

234
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,870
Calm down, Eugeo.

235
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,330
I was sure that
you would have exploded before me.

236
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,790
It would've been dangerous if you had a sword.

237
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:33,840
But I thought there might be something else
behind this, so I kept an eye out.

238
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,010
Something else?

239
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:39,180
This might be a trap targeting you, Eugeo.

240
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:45,060
For example, if you'd taken their bait
and said too much after confronting Humbert,

241
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:51,310
they might acknowledge that as impropriety,
and punish you with maximum penalty.

242
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,160
If Humbert continues to abuse Frenica,

243
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,910
we should at least make preparations
so we can have the instructors look into this.

244
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,870
Yeah, I agree.

245
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:12,500
Eugeo, if those guys say anything to you again
when I'm not around,

246
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,090
try not to get so passionate like you did today.

247
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,470
I know already. Stay cool, right?

248
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,430
That's right.

249
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,100
Stay cool.

250
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:27,020
Elite Disciple Sir Eugeo,

251
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,640
allow me to report.

252
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,230
I've finished today's cleaning.

253
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,980
All right. Good job.

254
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,690
Thanks, as always.

255
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,820
Oh, no, it's my job as your page!

256
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,320
Um, sorry, but do you mind if we have a talk?

257
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,780
I don't want you to stand, so have a seat.

258
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,550
All right, please excuse me.

259
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,230
It's about Frenica...

260
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,810
I confronted Humbert about that yesterday.

261
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,360
Is that so?

262
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,530
I don't think he wants to turn this
into a worse situation

263
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,820
so I don't think
he'll give any more deviant orders.

264
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,700
Thank goodness.

265
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,830
Thank you very much, Elite Disciple Sir Eugeo.

266
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,200
You're done with your work,
so you can call me Eugeo.

267
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,960
Also, there's something
that I need to apologize for.

268
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,040
I said this yesterday, too,

269
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:44,300
but it's been made clear now that this incident
was caused by my duel with Humbert.

270
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,390
I'd like to give her a proper apology as well.

271
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,890
So could you set up a meeting for me?

272
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,110
Is that right?

273
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:00,780
No, this isn't your fault, Eugeo-senpai.

274
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,740
But I'll be sure to convey your words to Frenica.

275
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,280
Um, c-could I...

276
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,000
sit a little closer to you?

277
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,750
Sure.

278
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,590
Not long after I graduate Swordcraft Academy,

279
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,850
I will take over as head of the Schtrinen family,

280
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:35,810
and receive a husband
from the same rank, or one rank higher.

281
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,110
I'm afraid.

282
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,200
If the man who becomes my husband
turns out to be like Sir Zizek...

283
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:51,950
Someone without pride, who doesn't
give a second thought about being cruel...

284
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,790
When I think about what to do...

285
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,330
I get really scared.

286
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,370
I...

287
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,180
Tiese?

288
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:13,810
Eugeo-senpai, I, um...
I have a favor to ask of you.

289
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:18,770
Eugeo-senpai, you'll definitely,
definitely represent our academy,

290
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,900
win the Swordsmanship Tournament,

291
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,650
and compete
in the Four Empires Unification Tournament.

292
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:28,530
W-Well, of course,
that's what I'm aiming for, too.

293
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,990
Um, and then, uh...

294
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,910
I-If you rank high
in the Unification Tournament,

295
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,330
I hear you can get appointed to an aristocrat

296
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,630
like Ms. Azurica, the dorm supervisor
for the Novice Trainees.

297
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:46,380
Um, if you become one,

298
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,590
Will you...

299
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,220
Will you be my...

300
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,930
<i>I'm striving to compete
in the Unification Tournament</i>

301
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:00,020
<i>to become an Integrity Knight,
and be reunited with Alice.</i>

302
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,310
<i>Just for that reason.</i>

303
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:08,240
Okay. Got it.

304
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,820
After the tournament,
I'll be sure to go see you.

305
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,660
Me, too. I'll become stronger, too!

306
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:22,380
So strong that I can say what's right,
and say what must be said.

307
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,340
Just like you, Eugeo-senpai.

308
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,190
Next time: Taboo Index.
