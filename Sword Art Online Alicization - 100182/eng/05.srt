1
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,570
Asuna!

2
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,210
Asuna! Run!

3
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,140
Kirito!

4
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:52,190
Operation in Progress

5
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,530
Sunday, June 28, 2026  Setagaya General Hospital

6
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,670
Asuna!

7
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,630
Suguha...

8
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,710
Mrs. Kirigaya...

9
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,030
Monday, June 29, 2026

10
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,200
We believe he's no longer in danger.

11
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,410
Is that so?

12
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,870
That said, since his heart was stopped
for more than five minutes,

13
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,420
his brain may have sustained
some kind of damage.

14
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,590
His mental or physical abilities,

15
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,760
or perhaps both,
may have suffered lasting damage.

16
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,510
Worst case, he might never regain consciousness.

17
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,890
No!

18
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,600
We won't know the extent of the damage
until he's had an MRI.

19
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:14,190
I'd advise you to transfer him
to a better-equipped facility.

20
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,240
I'll get you started on the paperwork.
This way, please.

21
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,200
Okay.

22
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,130
Asuna. Suguha.

23
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,460
Mr. Kikuoka?

24
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,090
Can you tell me
where I can find Kirito's parents?

25
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,980
Ocean Turtle

26
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,690
Monday, June 29, 2026
National Defense Medical College Hospital

27
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,240
Thanks for waiting!

28
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,450
Where's your mom?

29
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,410
She said to go ahead and sign in
while she parks the car.

30
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,460
I see.

31
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,040
So this is the hospital
where Kirito's being treated.

32
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,380
Yes. They say he was transported
by ambulance earlier today.

33
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,180
There's only one facility in the world
that's sufficiently equipped.

34
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,520
If we take him there,
Kazuto can get the treatment he needs.

35
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,730
We'd like to visit one of your patients.

36
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,030
Mr. Kazuto Kirigaya, is it? One moment, please.

37
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,700
Um...

38
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,870
I need to go check with my supervisors,
so please wait here.

39
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,540
Tuesday, June 30, 2026  Sylvain

40
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,170
You didn't get to see him?

41
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:24,050
Because he's being treated with specialized equipment,
they said no visitors until he's recovered.

42
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,970
But can they really do something like that?

43
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,260
I mean, you're his family!
You can't visit, let alone see him?

44
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,020
Something doesn't seem right.

45
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,350
That's right.

46
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,600
We thought it was strange, too,
so we did some digging.

47
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,560
According to the data, he's definitely a patient,

48
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,360
but the ambulance that transported my brother
never arrived at that hospital.

49
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:50,120
You mean Kirito's not actually there?

50
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,240
Didn't Mr. Kikuoka tell you anything?

51
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,910
His phone's been out of range,
and he hasn't returned my emails.

52
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,920
When I called the ministry,
they said he's been away on business since yesterday.

53
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,050
No matter how you look at it, that's suspicious!

54
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,340
That geezer has to be up to something!

55
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,760
Seijirou Kikuoka, huh?

56
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,640
I always thought he was a shady character.

57
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,890
I hope he's not making Kirito do something again.

58
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:19,350
That can't be! Kirito's unconscious, remember?

59
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:25,860
Unconscious? But that's really only how it looks
on the outside, right?

60
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,320
If they use a machine
that can access the soul itself...

61
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,320
The Soul Translator?

62
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,500
Soul Trans...

63
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,790
What's that?

64
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:42,540
There's a new type of dive machine
that can read human souls.

65
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,340
It's being developed by a company named Rath.

66
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,930
Rath? Isn't that the company
my brother was working for part-time?

67
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,800
You knew about that, Leafa?

68
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,850
Uh, no, nothing specific.

69
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,600
But I did hear that the company's in Roppongi.

70
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,940
Then Kirito could be somewhere in Roppongi.

71
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:08,490
Actually, there may be one thin connection to Kirito.

72
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,740
What is it?

73
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,660
I told you about it the other day, Shino-non.

74
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,450
You know, Kirito's... this.

75
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,290
Oh, you mean that heart rate monitor?

76
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,960
What? What is that?

77
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,790
It's been out of range the entire time.

78
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,920
But I'm having someone trace back the data
and analyze it.

79
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,840
Who?

80
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,180
Yui? How's it going?

81
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,090
Yes!

82
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,390
I will now report the results of my analysis!

83
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,390
I was only able to acquire three positions.

84
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,900
This is Setagaya General Hospital,
where Daddy was first taken.

85
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:52,780
And this is the first location I was able to pinpoint.

86
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:59,950
Aobadai 3-Chome, Meguro Ward.
The time was around 20:50 on June 29, 2016.

87
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,960
I will now display his predicted route.

88
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,340
This is the second position.

89
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,920
Shirogane-dai 1-Chome, Minato Ward.
At around 21:10 on the same day.

90
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,130
Next...

91
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,680
Kaigan 2-Chome, Minato Ward,
at around 21:20, on the same day.

92
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,940
Since that time,
there have been no signals from Daddy.

93
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,980
So he's not in Tokorozawa or Roppongi?

94
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,650
Yui, what's at that address?

95
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,280
It seems to be a warehouse located
in the harbor district.

96
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,370
Why would they take him there?

97
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,620
Minato Ward?

98
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,540
Tuesday, June 30, 2026  Near Minato Ward

99
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,180
It's nighttime, and there's no traffic,
so we'll be there soon.

100
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:01,020
Klein, thank you so much for driving us!

101
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,190
Come on, I keep telling you
there's no need to thank me!

102
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,400
Still, I just saw him in GGO the other day.

103
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,690
I really hope Kirito's okay.

104
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,660
Seriously, he's always getting tangled up
in one thing or another.

105
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,030
By the way,
didn't you say that this Rath is in Roppongi?

106
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,250
Shouldn't we be searching there, too?

107
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,370
Yes.

108
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,330
Sinon and the others are on their way there.

109
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,090
But Rath is a complete mystery.

110
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:36,340
Yui thoroughly investigated it for us,
but could only come up with its location.

111
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,300
There was nothing about the structure
or nature of its business.

112
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:45,230
As for the "Soul Translator,"
we couldn't find anything at all,

113
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,770
including any patents they applied for.

114
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,820
Reading and writing human souls
is an extraordinary invention,

115
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,860
but they haven't even applied for a patent?

116
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,150
The guys are thorough.

117
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,280
We're almost there.

118
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,290
Tuesday, June 30, 2026  Shinagawa Wharf

119
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,250
This is it?

120
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,370
But seriously...

121
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:12,340
did they really stash Kirito in a place like this?

122
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:18,970
Liz?

123
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:25,850
We did find Rath, but they have tight security
and wouldn't even talk to us.

124
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:31,020
Additionally, we had Yui check
all the security cameras around here,

125
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,070
but there's no sign
that Kirito was ever brought here.

126
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,860
Really? I see.

127
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,280
Yui?

128
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,990
Yes, Mommy.

129
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,030
I've checked the security cameras in this area, too.

130
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:52,630
Yesterday at 21:20, a helicopter took off
from that clearing over there.

131
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,340
A helicopter?

132
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,260
Yes. I believe Daddy may have been on it.

133
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,600
Then you mean my brother's been transported
even farther away?

134
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,720
But... wait.

135
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,890
Yui.

136
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,730
This is the last place
that any signals were picked up, right?

137
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,900
Yes.

138
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:15,230
Even if Kirito really did get carried away
by helicopter,

139
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,570
they'd ultimately have to transport him
to some kind of facility.

140
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,950
I can't believe he'd be that far out of range.

141
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:27,660
Right. One possibility is that
he may have been transported overseas.

142
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,870
Overseas?

143
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,670
Under the circumstances,
that would be the most likely scenario.

144
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,670
If that's the case,
then there's no way for us to go after him.

145
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,260
Big Brother... where did you go?

146
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,930
Kirito.

147
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,430
Please, cheer up, Mommy!

148
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,930
Yui.

149
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:54,980
When Daddy searched for you in ALfheim,
he never gave up, not even once!

150
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,020
But...

151
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,860
This time, it's your turn to search for Daddy!

152
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,280
There's sure to be a connection
that will lead to Daddy.

153
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,450
No matter who you're up against,

154
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:10,330
I believe that nothing can ever sever
the bond you have with Daddy.

155
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,680
No matter what kind of danger he found himself in,
Kirito's always made it back safely.

156
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,390
He has to be safe now, too.

157
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,610
Thank you, Yui! I'm not going to give up.

158
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,780
That's the spirit!

159
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,450
If we can just find one more clue.

160
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,240
Assuming that Rath has something to do
with where Kirito is now,

161
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,750
Suguha, do you remember anything
Kirito might've mentioned?

162
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,800
He's been away at work,
so we haven't had much time to talk lately.

163
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:08,390
I think he said the machine at his part-time job
in Roppongi was based on the Medicuboid.

164
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,810
That machine must be the STL.

165
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,190
The Medicuboid...

166
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,480
I remember him telling me something once.

167
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,570
That the one who created the basic design
for the Medicuboid was the commander, Akihiko Kayaba,

168
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,360
but that someone else developed it further
for the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.

169
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:31,160
She was looking after Heathcliff's physical body
while he was diving.

170
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,660
She was doing full-dive technology research
with him in the same lab.

171
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,420
I think the name he mentioned was...

172
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,880
Rinko... Kojiro.

173
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,670
Let me check.

174
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,470
The most likely match for that name

175
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,140
is currently working in research
at a university in California.

176
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,310
This person.

177
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,770
I've accessed the university database.

178
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,980
Looking at her career,
she's a former member of the Shigemura Lab,

179
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,780
at Toto Institute of Technology's
Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering.

180
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,660
Wasn't Shigemura the guy
who developed the Augma?

181
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,040
And that's also the commander's research lab.

182
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:20,210
This person might know about STL... about Rath...

183
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,040
America  California State

184
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,980
Seijirou Kikuoka   Requesting your participation in the project

185
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,360
A castle floating in the sky?

186
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,740
Yes. This castle is made up of numerous floors,

187
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,540
and on each floor you'll find a town,
a forest, and a vast plain.

188
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,080
After you climb up a long staircase
between each floor,

189
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,960
there is a palace at the very top.

190
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,630
And who would be there?

191
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:08,920
I don't know.

192
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:14,720
When I was very small,
I used to be able to go to that castle every night.

193
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,930
Every night, I'd climb up each staircase,

194
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,810
and get closer to the top, bit by bit.

195
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:28,320
But then at some point,
I wasn't able to go there again.

196
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,370
Just a silly dream.
I've almost completely forgotten about it.

197
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,800
Liar.

198
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,260
Again?

199
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,940
Asuna Yuuki

200
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,940
Asuna... Yuuki?

201
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,910
It's coming into view.

202
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,700
That's the Ocean Turtle.

203
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,840
Turtle... I see. It certainly looks like a turtle.

204
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,220
Though its face looks more like a pig.

205
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,270
A turtle-pig.

206
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,520
Did something like that
appear in Alice in Wonderland?

207
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,730
Rath...

208
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,930
Dr. Kojiro. We've been waiting for you.

209
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,340
And this is?

210
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,100
My assistant, Mayumi Reynolds.

211
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:30,270
I'm Lieutenant Nakanishi.
I've been ordered to escort you.

212
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,610
Now then, this way, please.

213
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,330
Dr. Kojiro, a visiting researcher, and her assistant,
Ms. Reynolds, will be entering Sector S3.

214
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,870
Verifying identity.

215
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,840
Verified.

216
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,550
I'm sorry,
but could you please remove those sunglasses?

217
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,800
Verified.

218
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:00,890
Go ahead.

219
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,230
Pretty tight security.

220
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,560
Even though we're in the middle of the ocean.

221
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,690
Well, we did omit the full-body check.

222
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,410
But you've already gone through
about three metal and explosives detectors.

223
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,220
Welcome to Rath.

224
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,730
Lieutenant Colonel Kikuoka.

225
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,150
Why are you dressed like that?

226
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,150
All right, if you'll excuse me.

227
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,450
I've been stuck here in the middle of the ocean
for a month now.

228
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,870
I can't always be wearing my uniform.

229
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,910
I'm beyond thrilled to have you here at Rath.

230
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,080
My persistence in summoning you finally paid off.

231
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,460
Not that there's any guarantee I can be of use.

232
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:26,520
You're the last of the three people
I felt would be indispensable to this project.

233
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,310
And now all three of you are here.

234
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,560
Oh? I see.

235
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,780
And one of those three...
I'm guessing that would be you, Higa?

236
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,530
Well, of course it's me.

237
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,120
As a member of the Shigemura Lab,
I have to carry on the senior members' ambition.

238
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,830
Really... you haven't changed at all.

239
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,960
So? Who's this third person?

240
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,250
Regretfully, I can't introduce you right now.

241
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,550
If the opportunity rises in a few days...

242
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:00,720
Then I'll say the name instead, Mr. Kikuoka.

243
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,850
Asuna... why are you with Dr. Kojiro?

244
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,480
I received an email from her.

245
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:19,400
<i>A machine called the Soul Translator,
based on the Medicuboid,</i>

246
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,570
<i>the medical full-dive machine
you provided the technology for,</i>

247
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,280
<i>is now being developed
by an organization called Rath.</i>

248
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:32,790
<i>While involved in the test runs for this machine,
Kazuto Kirigaya disappeared without a trace.</i>

249
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,170
Kazuto Kirigaya...

250
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:41,260
Kazuto Kirigaya

251
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:41,260
Inside the old SAO server,
I met Kayaba's digital ghost.

252
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,470
It was there that I received a certain program.

253
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:51,020
Kayaba called it the World Seed.

254
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,440
If you feel any hatred for him,
please dispose of what he gave you.

255
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,240
But if there's...

256
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:06,450
If there's something besides hatred inside you...

257
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:14,080
<i>I found your email address in the contacts list
on Kirito's computer.</i>

258
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:21,340
<i>Doctor, you're the only one
who can possibly lead me to Rath, to where Kirito is...</i>

259
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,090
<i>Please help me.</i>

260
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:31,560
So now do you understand why I felt obligated
to accept your invitation, Mr. Kikuoka?

261
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,350
To verify your assistant's identity,

262
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:39,770
I'm sure that we ran all kinds of checks
on a photo we acquired from the university database.

263
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:43,860
Yes, I can't tell you how many times
they scrutinized my face.

264
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:49,240
But I'd already switched out the photo
in the database for my own.

265
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,250
After all, I have a friend who's skilled
at bypassing defenses.

266
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:58,580
By the way, the real Mayumi is probably
on some beach right now, working on her tan.

267
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,420
Where's Kirito?

268
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,730
<i>Next time: Project Alicization.</i>
