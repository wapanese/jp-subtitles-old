00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:07,610
May 25, 380 HE

2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,240
Enough! Let go of my hand!

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,740
I don't intend to live with the shame
of being saved by a sinner like you!

4
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,620
Id—

5
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,210
Stay still, you idiot!

6
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:30,210
If you're an Integrity Knight, then realize that
despair's not going to get you anywhere! Idiot!

7
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,760
Y-You insulted me yet again!
Take that back, criminal!

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,760
Shut up! I called you an idiot
because you're an idiot, idiot! Idiot!

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,930
Listen!

10
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,100
If you fall to your death now,

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,600
Eugeo, who's still inside the tower,
will go to where the pontifex is!

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,900
Isn't it your job to stop that?

13
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:56,320
So you'd think your top priority as an Integrity Knight
would be to survive no matter what!

14
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,620
You're an idiot who's too dumb to understand,
so I'm calling you an idiot!

15
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,540
Th-That's eight times you spoke of me that way.

16
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,460
I see. What you're saying does make sense.

17
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,800
And yet, if that's true,
then why won't you let go of my hand?

18
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:22,260
Can you prove that I won't find the reason
to be less tolerable than death?

19
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,140
I...

20
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,030
Truce

21
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:06,200
Eugeo and I didn't climb this high in the Cathedral
to destroy the Axiom Church.

22
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:12,000
We also want to protect the Human Empire
from the Dark Territory's invasion.

23
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:23,140
That's why we can't let you,
one of the most powerful Integrity Knights, die now.

24
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,470
Because you're a valuable asset.

25
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,180
Then why did you wield your sword against another
and cause bloodshed,

26
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,770
violating the gravest taboo of all?

27
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,270
I...

28
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,030
The reason Eugeo and I slashed Raios and Humbert
at the Academy

29
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,700
was because the Axiom Church
and the Taboo Index are both wrong.

30
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,910
Just because something's not prohibited
by the Taboo Index,

31
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:53,500
that gives high-ranking nobles the right
to have their way with girls like Ronie and Tiese.

32
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,210
Is that what you believe?

33
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,630
Well?

34
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,800
Answer me, Integrity Knight!

35
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,840
The law is the law.

36
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,850
A crime is a crime.

37
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,230
If the people are allowed
to judge arbitrarily,

38
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,150
then how are we to maintain order?

39
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:22,030
Who decides whether the pontifex, Administrator,
who created those laws, is right or wrong?

40
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,990
The gods from the heavens?

41
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,030
Then why aren't they immediately striking me
with lightning as divine punishment and burning me?

42
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:35,880
The will of the gods... of Stacia, is revealed in due course
through the actions of us, her servants.

43
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,920
Eugeo and I climbed all this way
to make that clear!

44
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,300
To defeat Administrator, and prove it's wrong!

45
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,260
And for that exact same reason...

46
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,480
...I can't let you die right now!

47
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,950
Stick your sword in the seam of the wall!
Mine won't last much longer. Please!

48
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,890
It's not as if I saved you.
I simply returned the favor.

49
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,310
Besides, our duel has yet to be decided.

50
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,730
I see. I guess this means we're even.

51
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,360
I have an idea.

52
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:53,790
Right now, we both need
to somehow get back inside the tower.

53
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,460
So why don't we call a truce till that happens?

54
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,710
A truce?

55
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,330
Yeah.

56
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:04,420
Our odds of survival should go up if we work together,
rather than alone.

57
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,130
What exactly do you mean by "work together"?

58
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,600
To save each other
if one of us starts to fall, that's all.

59
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,560
It would be more certain if we had a rope,
but I guess that's asking too much.

60
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,070
That is a logical proposal. I have to admit that.
It can't be helped.

61
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:29,860
However, the instant we set foot inside the tower again,
I shall slay you.

62
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,370
Do not forget that, even for a moment.

63
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,950
I'll keep that in mind.

64
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,790
Now then, you needed a rope?

65
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,040
System Call.

66
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,250
Form Object. Change Shape.

67
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,510
A matter-transformation art?

68
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,430
What were you listening to?

69
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,010
All I did was change its shape.

70
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,310
No one can use the command to convert
an object's properties but the pontifex herself.

71
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,810
Sorry about that.

72
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,030
All right.

73
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,340
U-Um, let me ask you, just to be sure...

74
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,510
What is it?

75
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:36,390
Are you able to summon that giant dragon
you dangled me from on the way here?

76
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,850
Dragons can approach no closer
than the landing platform on the thirtieth floor.

77
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:47,070
Not even Uncle... no, the commander himself
can get any higher on a dragon.

78
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:52,200
Even the birds can't reach the upper floors
of the Cathedral.

79
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:59,290
I don't know the details, but I've heard that
a special command cast by the pontifex is in effect.

80
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:04,380
I see. So that leaves us with three options.

81
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,420
Descend, ascend, or break through the wall again.

82
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,340
The third option will be difficult.

83
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:17,180
Because the outer Cathedral wall is endowed
with nearly infinite life and regenerative abilities.

84
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,560
Is that so?

85
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:24,020
If we did head up from here,
is there anywhere we could reenter the tower?

86
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,110
Yes, there is.

87
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:34,320
There's a place called the Morning Star Lookout,
which has pillars on all four sides and is open to the air.

88
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,450
If we can make it there,
we should be able to reenter easily.

89
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:42,250
That said, even if we do manage
to reach the ninety-fifth floor,

90
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,210
I shall have to slay you there.

91
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,630
Right, that was the promise.

92
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,760
So it's fine to climb the wall?

93
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,840
It's fine.

94
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:59,350
Still, you make it sound so easy,
but how are you going to climb up this wall?

95
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,980
System Call. Generate Metallic Element.
Wedge Shape.

96
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,080
A-Are you all right?

97
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,080
I'm fine... at least I think so.

98
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,540
System Call. Generate Metallic Element.

99
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,090
Okay. I think this will work!

100
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,300
Do the same thing I did
and climb up to the first rod.

101
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,600
That's impossible.

102
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,100
What was that?

103
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,390
I said that's impossible!

104
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,400
B-But hey, I wouldn't say it's impossible.

105
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,150
It would be easy for anyone with your power
to hoist her own body up—

106
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,280
That's not what I mean!

107
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,990
This is the first time
I've found myself in a situation like this,

108
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,700
and I-I may be embarrassing myself, but...

109
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,750
it's all I can do to hang like this.

110
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,120
I can't possibly climb to such a narrow foothold.

111
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,750
All right! Then I'll pull on this chain
and hoist you up!

112
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,670
I would appreciate that.

113
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,180
Okay, I'm going to pull you up slowly.

114
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,140
Here goes!

115
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,310
Okay, you can pull your sword out now!

116
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,380
Place both hands against the wall!

117
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,130
All right, I'm going to climb higher.

118
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,930
I'll give you the signal again, so be ready.

119
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,600
Please be careful.

120
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:04,890
Roger.

121
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,320
Monday, July 6, 2026

122
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,540
Ms. Asuna?

123
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,460
Do you think they caught this fish
from the Ocean Turtle?

124
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,670
I-I'm not sure.

125
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,920
I see something over there.

126
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,060
It doesn't look like a fishing boat.

127
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,230
It has a huge array of antennas.

128
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,730
A warship?

129
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,690
That's a Japanese ship.

130
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,650
There are no warships in Japan.

131
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,730
Good morning, Dr. Kojiro, Ms. Yuuki.

132
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,150
Good morning!

133
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,150
Good morning, Mr. Nakanishi.

134
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,450
If it's not a warship, then is it an SDF vessel?

135
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,120
Close.

136
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,870
The MSDF vessels are called escort ships.

137
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:16,750
And that vessel is a five-ton,
general-purpose escort ship, the DD119 Asahi.

138
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,050
It's the lead ship of the second-generation Asahi-type
escort ships, the second vessel being the Shiranui.

139
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,430
- Huh? Isn't the ship moving away?
- These two are the only ships in the Asahi line.

140
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,600
Excuse me.

141
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,400
Lt. Colonel Kikuoka. Nakanishi here.

142
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,980
I just observed the Asahi
changing course to the west.

143
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,860
If I'm not mistaken, wasn't it supposed to escort us
until 1200 hours the day after tomorrow?

144
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,120
Yes sir, I'll be right there.

145
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,200
I apologize, but please excuse me.

146
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,290
I wonder what's going on?

147
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,250
I don't know.

148
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,150
System Call. Generate Metallic Element.

149
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,990
The sun...

150
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:35,460
Generating containers does significantly
deplete spatial resources.

151
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:40,420
Once Solus sets,
we might be lucky to create one every hour.

152
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,220
How high have we climbed so far?

153
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:49,390
Let's see.
I think we've passed the eighty-fifth floor by now.

154
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,930
The ninety-fifth floor is still quite a long way off.

155
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:53,640
Yeah.

156
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:57,850
Either way, it will be too dangerous to climb
once it's completely dark.

157
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,440
Hey, do you see something up there?

158
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,030
Could they be statues or something?
But why in such a high place?

159
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,500
Does it matter?
As long as we can sit on them and rest.

160
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,170
But they're at least six meters... six mels away.

161
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,090
I'm going to need two more rods, at least.

162
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,750
Two rods, huh?

163
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,510
Understood.

164
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,180
I was saving this for an emergency,

165
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,800
but apparently, now is the time.

166
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,230
Form Object. Wedge Shape.

167
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,060
Please use these.

168
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,570
Thanks! That helps.

169
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,740
Ready? I'm going to pull you up.

170
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,370
Okay.

171
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,870
Are you okay?

172
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,580
I'm fine.

173
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,630
That's...

174
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,970
That is one creepy design, huh?

175
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,480
It's from the Dark Territory!

176
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:25,860
Alice!

177
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:29,950
Alice!

178
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,720
Alice! Draw your sword!

179
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,060
Those monsters are coming for you!

180
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,600
Alice!

181
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,980
It'll be bad if they attack us all at once.

182
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,110
For me, anyway, but Alice...

183
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,370
Alice!

184
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,450
Alice!

185
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,330
Hold onto the chain as tight as you can!

186
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,830
You're not going to...

187
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,670
If we both survive,
I'll apologize as much as you want later!

188
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,840
Here goes!

189
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,130
One!

190
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,210
Two!

191
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,010
Three!

192
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,770
Why, you!

193
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:56,070
Wh-What were you thinking, you complete idiot!

194
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,120
It couldn't be helped, what else could I have...

195
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,660
We'll talk later! Here they come!

196
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,090
There's no doubt.

197
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,470
What are they doing here?

198
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,350
What's been bothering you?

199
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,350
Do you know what those monsters are?

200
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,100
Yes. I know.

201
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:33,900
They're soulless, evil familiars controlled
by dark art users from the Dark Territory,

202
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,910
who created them out of lumps of soil.

203
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,990
Following their lead, we call them minions.

204
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,540
Minions?

205
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Why would we find a horde of those things lined up
on the wall of the most sacred place in the Human Empire?

206
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,880
I want to know that as well!

207
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,470
Without you having to tell me,
I know this is something that shouldn't be.

208
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,550
I simply cannot believe that minions

209
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:03,720
could slip past the Integrity Knights' watch
and infiltrate all the way to the Central Cathedral.

210
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,980
Not to mention...

211
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:10,190
Not to mention that someone
of high authority within the Church

212
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,230
might have deliberately placed them there.

213
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,070
Such a thing could never be.

214
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,200
Here they come!

215
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,950
Watch out! Two are heading your way!

216
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,740
Who do you think I am?

217
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,800
Do you need my assistance?

218
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,390
No thanks!

219
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,330
What is it?

220
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,750
Nothing. I was just thinking
how strange your moves are.

221
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,080
If you were to perform them on a stage
during the summer solstice festival,

222
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,880
you'd gather quite an audience, no?

223
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,670
Thanks for that.

224
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,590
Wait, have you been to
the Centoria summer solstice festival, then?

225
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,760
I mean, that's a festival for the commoners,
and even at the Academy,

226
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,100
almost all of the students
from high-ranking noble families didn't go.

227
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,480
Please don't think that I'm the same
as those arrogant nobles!

228
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,480
Of course I've seen—

229
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,270
...it before.

230
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,940
Alice?

231
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:44,410
No. I heard there was such a festival
from one of the monks.

232
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,330
We Integrity Knights

233
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:51,500
are prohibited from mingling with the townsfolk
except in the line of duty.

234
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,500
Minion blood will bring about illness.

235
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,050
Make sure you wipe it off.

236
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,720
Hey!

237
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:08,140
Really, why are men all so...

238
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,690
Do you not have even a single handkerchief?

239
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,600
N-No, I don't.

240
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,570
It's fine. Just use this.

241
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,320
Thank you very much.

242
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,080
Return it to me washed, before I slay you.

243
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,460
<i>Come to think of it,
since we met two years ago,</i>

244
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,300
<i>Kirito's always been by my side.</i>

245
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,390
<i>This might be the first time
I've ever been on my own.</i>

246
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,510
<i>Kirito...</i>

247
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,890
<i>No, Kirito should already be...</i>

248
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,100
<i>I'm sure he's started climbing the tower
on the outside.</i>

249
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,480
<i>And Alice, too.</i>

250
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,780
The nintieth floor, huh?

251
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,710
There has to be an Integrity Knight inside.

252
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,920
Here goes.

253
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,350
Is this a bath?

254
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,910
Sorry, but would you wait a little longer?

255
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,990
I only just arrived in the capital,

256
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:56,960
and my whole body is stiff from riding
on that dragon for so long.

257
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:39,140
Next time: The Legendary Hero.
