1
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,980
Departure

2
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,070
Eugeo.

3
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,960
Hey, Eugeo, get a hold of yourself!

4
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,130
When I count to three,
we're going to slam into those four.

5
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,470
And then knock over those fires.

6
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:58,880
Okay.

7
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,930
Don't lose that glowing grass.

8
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,190
Once the fires are out,
pick up a sword from the ground.

9
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,810
I'll take care of that huge one.

10
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,730
While I'm doing that,
keep the others away from me.

11
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,280
I've... never fought with a sword before!

12
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,410
It's the same as an ax. Come on!

13
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,030
One...

14
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,490
Two...

15
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,700
Three!

16
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,300
Eugeo!

17
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,760
Just drive back any that get too close!

18
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,810
Even if you say to...

19
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,860
I see. They don't like the light from this grass.

20
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,880
You think you can challenge
the great Ugachi the Lizard Killer?

21
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,300
You're wrong,
I'm not going to challenge you,

22
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,130
I'm going to beat you!

23
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,290
Sword skill...

24
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,590
Sharp Nail!

25
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,320
Kirito, are you all right?

26
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,950
<i>This hurts too much.</i>

27
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,160
<i>In a virtual world,
no way would I feel... pain like this!</i>

28
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,740
You little White Ium brat!

29
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,460
How dare you slice off my arm!

30
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,920
I won't forgive you!
I won't forgive you for this!

31
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:55,900
I could tear you apart, devour you,
and still never live this humiliation down!

32
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,710
<i>I'm scared...</i>

33
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,710
<i>But I've got to go!</i>

34
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,930
<i>If I don't, it'll be just the same as when Alice...</i>

35
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,690
Die!

36
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,200
Kirito!

37
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,950
This time...

38
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,700
...I'll be the one...

39
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,040
...to protect you!

40
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,500
Eugeo, run!

41
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,350
Eugeo!

42
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,150
Eugeo.

43
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,570
Eugeo.

44
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,450
Stay with me! Eugeo!

45
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,460
W-We promised each other as kids, remember?

46
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Me, you and Alice.

47
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,970
We were born on the same day,
so we're going to die on the same day.

48
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,050
This time...

49
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,560
...I'm keeping it.

50
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:10,280
<i>That's right.
I couldn't keep that promise, either, but...</i>

51
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,700
Die!

52
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,590
You lowly White Ium! I'll put you in your place!

53
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,390
I'm not an Ium!

54
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,890
I'm Kirito the Swordsman!

55
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,980
So what if you are?

56
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,230
<i>He might also be an Artificial Fluctlight.</i>

57
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,570
<i>But...</i>

58
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,620
<i>...I absolutely can't lose here!</i>

59
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,660
Sword Skill...

60
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,910
Sonic Leap!

61
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,350
I've taken the head of your boss.

62
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,220
If any of you still want to fight, come on!

63
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,310
Those who don't,
return to the land of darkness right now!

64
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,490
Hang in there!

65
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,670
Selka! Please wake up!

66
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,260
Kirito? Is that you?

67
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,300
Yeah. We came to rescue you. Are you okay?

68
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,050
Y-Yes. I'm fine.

69
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,600
Wh-What?

70
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,480
Eugeo's been badly hurt.

71
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,770
So...

72
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,110
Impossible.

73
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,650
A wound like this...

74
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
It's beyond my sacred arts abilities.

75
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,160
You have to try, even if it's impossible.

76
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,370
You're Alice's younger sister, aren't you?

77
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,750
I can never be like my sister.

78
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,290
The most I can heal are simple scratches.

79
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:31,420
You're the one Eugeo came to save, Selka!
Not Alice!

80
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,260
He came to save you!

81
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,850
Normal healing arts would take too long.

82
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,060
We'll have to try a dangerous high-level sacred art.

83
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,020
Kirito, I'm going to need your help.

84
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,730
All right. Say the word. I'll do anything.

85
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,480
Give me your left hand.

86
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,820
If I fail, we might both lose our lives as well.

87
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,620
I hope you're prepared.

88
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,790
If that happens,
make it so only my life is lost.

89
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,580
I'm ready anytime.

90
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,250
System Call.

91
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,210
Transfer Human Unit Durability.

92
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,260
Right Hand Self to Left.

93
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,100
<i>So Selka's transferring my life and her own?</i>

94
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,610
Kirito? Are you... still okay?

95
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,400
No problem.

96
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,200
More... Give more to Eugeo.

97
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:51,170
Kirito, Eugeo, I'll be waiting for you... always.

98
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,840
At the top of the Central Cathedral.

99
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,640
I'll always be waiting for you both.

100
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,140
You're...

101
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,520
K-Kirito?

102
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:15,980
Fifty!

103
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,620
How's your wound, Eugeo?

104
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:28,200
Yeah, after resting for an entire day,
it seems to be completely healed.

105
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,130
Hey, Eugeo, do you remember?

106
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,420
When we were inside that cave,
you said something strange.

107
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:42,550
You made it sound like
I'd always been friends with you and Alice.

108
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:47,680
I remember. But that can't be right
cause I only just met you.

109
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,270
For some reason,
I felt so sure about it in that moment.

110
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,060
That me, you and Alice...

111
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,650
...were born in this village,
and grew up together.

112
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,400
I think we were together
the day Alice was taken away, too.

113
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,110
I see.

114
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:08,580
By the way, when Selka used that sacred art,
did you hear someone's voice?

115
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,000
No. I was completely unconscious.

116
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,000
Did you hear something?

117
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,630
No, it was just my imagination.

118
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,090
Forget I asked.

119
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,590
Now then, let's get to work.

120
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,930
Here. Do your best!

121
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,510
I'm going to use this.

122
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,190
H-Hey, Kirito!

123
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,770
You can use that sword?

124
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,980
Well, just watch.

125
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,410
<i>Because of that goblin battle the other day,</i>

126
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,750
<i>my Object Control Authority
has exceeded this sword's number.</i>

127
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,170
<i>If so...</i>

128
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:08,850
See?

129
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,440
I bet you can swing it too, Eugeo.

130
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,950
Kirito, can you...

131
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,080
can you teach me to use a sword?

132
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,170
I want to bring Alice back.

133
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,840
Eugeo.

134
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:49,470
Because of me,
Alice and her family have suffered.

135
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,980
For the past six years,
I've never, ever stopped regretting it.

136
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,780
Wondering why I couldn't do anything
to save Alice?

137
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,790
I... want to become strong!

138
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,790
So I'll never make the same mistake again!

139
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,460
So that I can regain what I've lost.

140
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:26,880
That's why...

141
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,050
I want to become a swordsman!

142
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,010
All right. I'll teach you.

143
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,520
Everything that I know.

144
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,480
But the training's going to be tough.

145
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,480
That's what I was hoping for.

146
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,740
By the way,
what style is your sword technique?

147
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,790
My technique...

148
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,000
...is the Aincrad Style.

149
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,360
All right. Go ahead, Eugeo.

150
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,510
- H-Hey! Look!
- What is that?

151
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,570
It's like a dream.

152
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,660
I never thought I'd see this day.

153
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,370
I didn't believe in destiny at all.

154
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,790
But...

155
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:31,840
Kirito, I've been waiting in this forest
for the past six years for you to come.

156
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,050
Yeah. I'm sure...

157
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:42,730
...that I woke up in this forest
so I could meet you, Eugeo.

158
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,870
What, you're alone?

159
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,250
Yeah, Eugeo was summoned by the village elder
and went off somewhere.

160
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,670
I see.

161
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,960
But chopping down the demon tree
is amazing, huh?

162
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,380
I guess it was the fruit of Eugeo's labor!

163
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,720
I've got to study harder, too,
so I can perfect my sacred arts skills as a Sister!

164
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,180
Not that I can ever be like my sister...

165
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:31,190
Actually, I didn't go into that cave
to imitate my sister.

166
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,860
I just wanted to be even a little bit closer to her...

167
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,820
To go as far as I could.

168
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,660
To keep going until I couldn't go any further.

169
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:48,290
That's where I wanted to make sure
there was no way I could ever take her place.

170
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,630
No, you're amazing.

171
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:57,050
You went so far into that dark cave.

172
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,140
You did something only you could do.

173
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,970
Something only I could do?

174
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,140
You're not Alice's replacement.

175
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,730
I'm sure there's a talent that's unique to you.

176
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,400
So just take your time and develop it.

177
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:14,400
Okay.

178
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,280
Everyone! Could I have your attention?

179
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,660
The greatest wish of Rulid's founding ancestors
has been fulfilled at last!

180
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,450
The demon tree has been felled!

181
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,710
A triumph achieved by the son of Orick, Eugeo!

182
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:40,760
According to tradition, having completed his task,
Eugeo is given the right to choose his next Calling!

183
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,680
All right. Go ahead
and choose whatever path you wish

184
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:04,870
I...

185
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,540
I will become a swordsman!

186
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,340
I'm going to hone my skills...

187
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,920
...and head to the central city one day!

188
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,390
Eugeo. Surely you're not...

189
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,310
No. I won't ask you why.

190
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,520
After all, it's your right
to choose your next Calling.

191
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:40,610
As the elder of Rulid, I hereby approve
Eugeo's new Calling to be a swordsman!

192
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,710
Selka.

193
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,050
Eugeo.

194
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,630
Selka, there's something I want to tell you.

195
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,890
Wh-What?

196
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,680
I'm going to the central city
and bring Alice back.

197
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,270
My sister...

198
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,270
It's something I've been thinking about
for the last six years.

199
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:19,490
But I had no idea how to go about it.

200
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,160
But then I met Kirito,
and I finally have hope of bringing her back.

201
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,660
If Kirito's with me,
I feel like I can accomplish anything.

202
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:34,420
I know you and your family have suffered,
and I'm so sorry.

203
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,800
But I'll definitely bring Alice back.

204
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,880
So I want you to believe in me, and wait.

205
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:48,060
That's something only you can do, right?

206
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:48,930
Yeah.

207
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,020
I'll wait. So please...

208
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,480
...make sure all three of you come back!

209
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,700
Right! I promise!
All three of us will definitely come back!

210
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,660
It's a promise.

211
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,040
Sorry to keep you waiting, Kirito.

212
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,170
Yo.

213
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,800
All right, let's go.

214
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,630
Okay.

215
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,800
I wonder what kind of place the central city is?

216
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,390
No idea.

217
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:37,650
Well, it's got to be bigger than Rulid, right?

218
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,860
That's probably true.

219
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,740
The wind feels a little damp.

220
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,700
We should probably get going now.

221
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,410
Kirito?

222
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,660
R-Right.

223
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,750
All right, let's go, Kirito.

224
00:21:59,130 --> 00:21:59,960
Sure!

225
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,930
Next time: Ocean Turtle.
