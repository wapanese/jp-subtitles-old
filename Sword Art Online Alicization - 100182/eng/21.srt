1
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,240
Why?

2
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,240
Why did you lose to the Synthesis Ritual?

3
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,910
Wasn't the reason
you trained to be a swordsman

4
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,790
and left Rulid Village
to head for the capital city, Centoria,

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,790
to bring back your cherished childhood friend, Alice?

6
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,000
The 32nd Knight

7
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,960
Eugeo.

8
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,290
You and I have never fought seriously before,
have we?

9
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,670
I've thought about it a lot.

10
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,430
Which one of us would win
if we seriously crossed swords?

11
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:46,140
To be honest,
I always thought you'd surpass me one day.

12
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,560
<i>I've never shown you this skill before!</i>

13
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,740
Burst Element.

14
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,430
Is that person really your partner, Eugeo?

15
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,890
What do you mean?

16
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,390
You're the one who said
that Eugeo had already been synthesized!

17
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,680
That's true, but...

18
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,520
I'm not sure how to say this.

19
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,980
For someone who just
became an Integrity Knight,

20
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,690
he seems too accustomed to battle.

21
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,940
For instance,
the Incarnate Arms skill he used earlier,

22
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,990
as well as that Aerial Element skill just now,

23
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,780
makes it hard to believe he's a novice.

24
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,620
Should I fight him next?

25
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,750
I'll do it.

26
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,930
<i>I'm counting on you, partner.</i>

27
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,890
<i>I promise to give you a name
when this fight is over.</i>

28
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,310
<i>So lend me your strength!</i>

29
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,060
Let's go, Eugeo!

30
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,680
Does the skill you just used have a name?

31
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,190
Baltio style. Storm Wave.

32
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,030
Baltio style? Golgorosso-senpai's sword style.

33
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,070
Eugeo, do you...

34
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,320
do you remember who taught you that sword skill?

35
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,570
I don't know or care.

36
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,580
She's the only one I need to know.

37
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:17,420
It's for her sake that I take up my sword,
and I live in order to eliminate her enemies.

38
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,670
<i>There's no doubt.</i>

39
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,510
<i>Just like Eldrie and Alice, now Eugeo has...</i>

40
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,930
The Piety Module is inserted in a way
that blocks links to memories.

41
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,640
This seals away the past
of the person becoming an Integrity Knight,

42
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:38,100
while simultaneously forcing absolute fealty
to the Axiom Church and the pontifex.

43
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,320
<i>What kind of memories originally existed
where the module's embedded?</i>

44
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,030
<i>If I can figure that out...</i>

45
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,570
<i>No, words won't be enough
to break Administrator's art!</i>

46
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,500
<i>What I infuse my sword with
will reach his soul.</i>

47
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,460
<i>That's what I'm going to believe!</i>

48
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,210
Eugeo!

49
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,220
Remember!
There are people who are precious to you!

50
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,180
Selka, who's waiting back in Rulid Village
for our return!

51
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,680
Golgorosso-senpai and Liena-senpai,
who instructed us at Swordcraft Academy!

52
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,850
Tiese and Ronie, who worried about us
right up till the moment we said goodbye!

53
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,060
And above all...

54
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,860
wasn't your wish
to go back to Rulid with Alice?

55
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,660
You have to remember, Eugeo!

56
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,410
Eugeo.

57
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,250
Alice.

58
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,760
Did you remember, Eugeo?

59
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,640
Eu... geo...

60
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,730
Kirito!

61
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,650
Enhance Armament.

62
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,620
Eugeo.

63
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,450
Why?

64
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,950
Have you dealt with those rebels,
Number Thirty-two?

65
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,750
I've sealed the two rebels in ice,
Your Eminence, Prime Senator.

66
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,790
That's fine, but...

67
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,090
you did finish them off properly, didn't you?

68
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,590
No, I did not finish them off, Prime Senator.

69
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,140
Since the pontifex's order was to stop the rebels.

70
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,270
That won't do! That just won't do!

71
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,560
When you speak to me, remember to call me,
"Your Eminence, Prime Senator."

72
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,730
"Your Eminence," got that? "Your Eminence"!

73
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:11,900
The next time you forget the "Your Eminence,"
you'll be turned into a horse as punishment!

74
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:17,740
You'll carry me on your back,
and while you're on all fours, I'll go "hi-yo"!

75
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:24,080
Now then, I think I'll go
carry out Her Eminence's orders.

76
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,890
Lady Pontifex.

77
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,100
Welcome back, Eugeo.

78
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,350
You've taken care of your errand.

79
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,060
Yes.

80
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,730
Well done! In that case,
I should give you a reward.

81
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,860
Please climb onto the bed.

82
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:04,040
All right, Eugeo, as promised,
let me give you what you desire.

83
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,920
Love that's meant only for you.

84
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,040
Yes.

85
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,170
But first, let me heal that wound for you.

86
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,220
Also,

87
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,890
let me have another good look at your face.

88
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,600
Since there was a convenient hole
in your memory,

89
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,270
I inserted the module there,

90
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,110
but perhaps I shouldn't have been lazy.

91
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,240
Let's redo your synthesis.

92
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,610
You can have your reward after that,
all right, Eugeo?

93
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,900
Just lie still.

94
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:22,110
This is an improved module
I had just completed.

95
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:28,250
Synthesizing you with it allows you
to use the power of "Meaning" immediately.

96
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,290
Will you show me your memories again?

97
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,510
This time, I'll insert it into the location
of what you hold most dear.

98
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,800
I've made it so you can move your mouth.

99
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,430
Now, chant the command I taught you earlier.

100
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,390
Did you forget it?
What am I going to do with you?

101
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,230
It's "Remove Core Protection."

102
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,860
M...

103
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,570
M...

104
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,490
Mo...

105
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,410
Mo... ve!

106
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,580
You...

107
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,620
For you to have regained your senses...

108
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,280
You certainly fooled me.

109
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,420
Not to mention, that prop is the handiwork
of that little brat from the Library, no?

110
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,500
But that's too bad.

111
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,970
No metal object of any kind
can damage my skin now.

112
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,630
You poor child.

113
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,010
Just when I'd promised you

114
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,390
that if you gave all of yourself to me,
I'd love you back the same amount.

115
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:17,690
That eternal love you've been seeking all your life,
that eternal control...

116
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,650
you were so close to obtaining it!

117
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,700
Eternal... love?

118
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,570
Eternal... control.

119
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,530
That's right, Eugeo.

120
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,620
If you entrust everything to me,

121
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,210
the thirst that's been making you suffer
will be quenched instantly.

122
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:40,590
All the fears and worries you've been carrying
will be erased.

123
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,170
This is your last chance, Eugeo.

124
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,840
Use the sword at your waist
to shatter that toy.

125
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:53,100
Do that, and I shall forgive your heinous crime
with my tremendous amount of love.

126
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,100
To love is to control, and to be controlled.

127
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,440
You're the pitiful one,
for having no other way to say it!

128
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,910
I'm sure you were once the same way.

129
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,530
Starved for love and sought it out,

130
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,370
but you were never given any.

131
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,080
Love isn't about control.

132
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,460
Nor is it something you can gain as a reward
or in a transaction.

133
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,500
The same way you water flowers,

134
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,460
you give it continuously.

135
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,130
I'm sure that that's what love is!

136
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,260
How disappointing.

137
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,220
I was going to forgive a sinful young boy
for rebelling against the Axiom Church

138
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,060
and try to save his soul,

139
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,690
but this is how you speak to me?

140
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,440
Maybe it would be a waste
to kill you and turned you into a jewel.

141
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,870
It will take some time, but perhaps
I'll use force synthesis on you, just like her.

142
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,780
Like her?

143
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,080
That's right.

144
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,580
Thirty, whom you're so infatuated with.

145
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,620
Because she also refused to chant the command,

146
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,880
the automated senators worked on her for days
to forcefully disable her protection.

147
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,210
Alice?

148
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,260
Well, I was asleep,
so I wasn't actually watching,

149
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,890
but it must have been so agonizing for her.

150
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:19,520
Well? How do you feel about
getting to at least share that experience?

151
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:33,160
Shatter.

152
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,860
That sword...

153
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,610
Now I see.

154
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,280
Please save me!

155
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,500
Please save me, Your Eminence, Pontifex!

156
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,830
You!

157
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,790
H-He's a traitor, Your Eminence!

158
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:30,130
He claimed that he sealed away Thirty
and the other one, but he went easyâ€”

159
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,760
Let go!

160
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,060
Kirito.

161
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,740
Yo, Eugeo!

162
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,210
Sorry.

163
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,420
I gave in to Administrator's temptation,
and ended up hurting you both.

164
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,180
I thought I should at least atone for it
by my own hand.

165
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,140
You're being so cold, Eugeo.

166
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,060
I knew that's what you were thinking right away.

167
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,930
You're the same as always.

168
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,770
Alice.

169
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,460
Is that the pontifex, Administrator?

170
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,580
That's right.

171
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,380
She hasn't changed at all after six years.

172
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:55,970
It was almost time
to reset Bercouli and Fanatio,

173
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,970
but I've only used you for six years, right?

174
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,060
Your logic circuits don't seem to be malfunctioning.

175
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,480
Could it be the influence of that irregular unit?

176
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,230
How amusing.

177
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:14,150
Hey, Alice, there must be something
you want to say to me.

178
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,490
I won't get mad. So say it now.

179
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,710
Lady Pontifex,

180
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,840
our glorious order of Integrity Knights
has been destroyed as of today.

181
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:42,140
All because of the swords
of the two rebels beside me,

182
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,810
as well as the endless obsession and deception
you built along with this tower.

183
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:54,440
My ultimate mission is to safeguard a tranquil lifestyle
and peaceful sleep for those without swords.

184
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,950
Therefore, Lady Pontifex, your actions

185
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,660
are unquestionably detrimental to the well-being
of those who reside in the Human Empire.

186
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,450
Shut... Shut your mouth!

187
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,330
Y-You lowly, defective puppet knight!

188
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:16,340
You wretched knights are merely puppets
that can only do as I order you to.

189
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,220
It doesn't seem to be a logic circuit error, after all.

190
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,850
And her Piety Module is still functioning.

191
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:29,230
Meaning that she disabled the Code 871
imposed by that person of her own volition?

192
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,190
Rather than by a sudden emotional burst?

193
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,900
<i>Code 871?
Is she talking about the Seal of the Right Eye?</i>

194
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,780
Well, I won't know anything more
unless I run an analysis.

195
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,700
Now then. Chudelkin?

196
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:48,700
Since I'm so generous, I'm giving you the chance
to restore your ruined reputation.

197
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,830
Let's see you render those three powerless
with your arts.

198
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,880
Y-Y-Your Eminence, Pontifex!

199
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,300
What, Chudelkin?

200
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,350
I, Prime Senator Chudelkin,

201
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:10,100
for the first time in my many years of service,
beg to present to you a most insolent request!

202
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:14,310
I shall gladly risk my life annihilating these rebels.
Therefore!

203
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,820
Once I've carried out my mission,
if Your Eminence... Y-Your Eminence...

204
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,070
If you would allow me touch your exalted body
with my own hands and kiss you,

205
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:26,700
A-A-A-And then spend the night of my dreams with you...

206
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,710
Please... please... please grant me that wish!

207
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,250
Very well, Chudelkin.

208
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,340
I swear on the goddess of creation, Stacia.

209
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,930
When you've fulfilled your mission,

210
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:47,760
every inch of my body
will be yours for the taking, for one night.

211
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:56,270
I am overcome with supreme joy at this moment.

212
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,030
And now... and now, I...

213
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,780
My fighting spirit's been amplified!
I'm overflowing with energy!

214
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,360
To be more specific...

215
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,950
I am invincible!

216
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,460
System... Call!

217
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:20,840
Generate...Thermal... Element!

218
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,260
Let me show you.

219
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,890
My greatest, ultimate sacred art...

220
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,640
Come forth, genie!

221
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,230
Burn these rebels to ash!

222
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,140
Next time: Titan of the Sword.
