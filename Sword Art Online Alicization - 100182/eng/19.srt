1
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:11,360
Speak. However,
if there's any trace of deceit in your words,

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,950
I will slay you on the spot.

3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,320
That's fine.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,500
If your decision to slay me is your own.

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,000
The reason I say that is because

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,010
there's an order inside you that you're not aware
was put there by someone else.

7
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,510
You Integrity Knights were summoned
from the heavens to maintain order and justice

8
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,730
by the surrogate of the gods, Administrator,
the pontifex of the Axiom Church,

9
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,060
or so you believe.

10
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:48,860
But...

11
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:55,950
Alice, you don't remember who gave birth to you,
or where you were raised.

12
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,290
I was told it's because the moment
Integrity Knights are called here,

13
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,210
the goddess Stacia seals our memories
of the heavens.

14
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,500
It's true that your memories have been sealed.

15
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,050
It wasn't the goddess Stacia who did that,
but the pontifex herself.

16
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,510
And it's not your memories of the heavens
that were sealed,

17
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,390
but of having been born and raised
as a human child in this world.

18
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,850
Your real name is Alice Zuberg.

19
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,520
You were born and raised in a small village
in the northern hinterlands called Rulid.

20
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,820
And when you were eleven,

21
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,440
you went to explore the cave
through the End Mountains

22
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,410
and ended up barely crossing the boundary
between the Human Empire and the Dark Territory.

23
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,160
In other words, the taboo you violated
was "trespassing into the Dark Territory."

24
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,840
Alice Zuberg.

25
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,050
That's my name?

26
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,340
Rulid... The End Mountains...

27
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,140
I can't remember any of it.

28
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,720
Don't force yourself to remember.
You'll end up like Eldrie.

29
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,930
Why would you say that now?

30
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,360
I... want to know everything.

31
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,990
The Seal of the Right Eye

32
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:56,460
Your father is Rulid's village elder,
and his name is Gasuft Zuberg.

33
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,760
Unfortunately, I don't know your mother's name,

34
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,840
but like I said before,
you have a younger sister. Her name is Selka.

35
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,590
Selka.

36
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,600
She's been worried about you
ever since you were taken away by the Church.

37
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:15,520
When you were living in Rulid,
I'm told you were called a prodigy of the sacred arts.

38
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,860
And she's working hard to become a good Sister,
to follow in her older sister's footsteps.

39
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,030
You told me something.

40
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,830
That you planned this rebellion

41
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:32,450
in order to correct the pontifex's wrongs
and to protect the human world.

42
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,170
Yeah. That's right.

43
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:40,960
Yet it's a fact that the pontifex's primary order
to us Integrity Knights

44
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,930
is to defend against an invasion
from the Dark Territory.

45
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,930
Even if you managed
to defeat every Integrity Knight,

46
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,730
as well as slay the pontifex herself,

47
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,690
then who would be left
to protect the Human Empire?

48
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,230
Then let me ask you this.

49
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,360
If you Integrity Knights counter
at full strength,

50
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:08,320
do you really believe that you can definitely repulse
the entire Dark Territory forces?

51
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,420
Prime Senator. Can you have a serious talk
with the pontifex soon?

52
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,130
The Dark Territory is steadily building up its forces.

53
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,130
There’s a limit to how much we can fight back
if we're the only—

54
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,880
Like I said!

55
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,390
It's your job as Integrity Knights
to do something about it!

56
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,770
Geez, you never shut up!

57
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,100
You just need to do as you're told! Seriously!

58
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,860
It's true that Uncle...

59
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:50,280
that His Eminence, Knight Commander Bercouli,
seemed to have the same doubts.

60
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:57,460
But even so, it's also a fact that aside from ourselves,
no other battle-ready force exists in the Human Empire.

61
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,500
But that's a situation of Administrator's own making.

62
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:07,050
The pontifex feared the emergence
of a force in the Human Empire

63
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,300
greater than her own absolute power.

64
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,890
So she allowed the high-ranking nobles,
who should reach for their swords first if war breaks out,

65
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:19,350
to lead indolent, lavish lives,
and as a result, their souls were corrupted.

66
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,860
But that doesn't mean it's too late.

67
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,820
Before the Dark Forces close in,

68
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,240
if we can raise the largest possible army
within the Human Empire—

69
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,160
There's no way we can do such a thing!

70
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,870
You just said it yourself.

71
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,960
How corrupt the nobles of this world have become!

72
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:43,630
Yeah, that's true. But not everyone is like that.

73
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,010
Among the lower-ranking nobles
and commoners,

74
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:50,090
there are a lot of people
who want to protect this world.

75
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,140
Commoners?

76
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,100
That's right.

77
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,520
If we distribute the huge stash of weapons
stored inside this tower,

78
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,440
and then teach them the same real sword skills
and sacred arts you all have been refining,

79
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,480
it wouldn't be impossible
to raise a solid army within a year.

80
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:11,490
But the way things are,
that can't be made a reality.

81
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,580
Because an army
whose loyalty to her can't be forced

82
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:20,000
is just as terrifying to Administrator
as the forces of darkness.

83
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,290
In other words, there's only one conclusion.

84
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:29,920
Our only option is to crush the pontifex's absolute rule,
maximize what little time we have left,

85
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,510
and then build up a defensive force
that can counter the imminent invasion.

86
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,270
That there are minions of darkness here...

87
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:48,570
That fact alone is irrefutable proof
that the pontifex is deceiving us, her loyal servants.

88
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,630
Will I get to see her?

89
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:12,840
If I agree to help you,
and regain my sealed memories,

90
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,470
will I get to see Selka...
my younger sister again?

91
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,730
You will.

92
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,810
But listen. I want you to hear me out.

93
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,190
It'll be someone who's both you and not you
that will see Selka.

94
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,820
The moment you get your memory back,

95
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,320
you'll go back to being Alice Zuberg
from before the Synthesis Ritual.

96
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,120
At the same time, the Integrity Knight
Alice Synthesis Thirty will cease to exist.

97
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,710
Selka. Selka.

98
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,380
I can't remember. Her face or voice.

99
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,470
But this isn't the first time
I've called that name.

100
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,850
My mouth, my throat,

101
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,890
my heart all remember.

102
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:04,690
Alice.

103
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:12,150
I called it over and over.
Every day, every night. Selka. Selka.

104
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:23,120
It's true. I have a family.

105
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,170
A father and a mother.

106
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,080
And a sister who's my own flesh and blood.

107
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,760
Somewhere underneath this night sky.

108
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:03,240
Once you told me that we Integrity Knights
were created by the pontifex,

109
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,750
I suspected that this might be the case.

110
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,340
That I'd stolen this body
from a girl named Alice Zuberg,

111
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,840
wrongfully occupying it for the last six years.
Isn't that right?

112
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,260
I must return what I've stolen, right?

113
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:25,430
I'm sure that's what Selka, her parents, your friend

114
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,560
and you yourself wish for.

115
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:29,900
Alice.

116
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,610
But there's just one...
one favor I'd like to ask of you.

117
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,860
Before the original Alice's personality
is restored to this body,

118
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,240
will you take me to Rulid Village?

119
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:47,200
And just one look while hidden is all I ask.

120
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,840
I want you to show me Selka,
my younger sister, as well as my family.

121
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,840
If you could just grant me that, I'll be satisfied.

122
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,760
Okay, I promise. I swear to you.

123
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,140
Before we restore your memories,
I'll definitely take you to Rulid Village.

124
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,640
No matter what, all right?

125
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,450
I've made up my mind.

126
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,790
In order to protect the Human Empire,
and those who reside in it,

127
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,170
I, Alice Synthesis Thirty, hereby forsake my mission
as an Integrity Knight and—

128
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,220
Alice?

129
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,010
Alice!

130
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,020
Kirito.

131
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:54,520
Alice.

132
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:05,820
<i>A bar code?
No, nothing like that exists in this world.</i>

133
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,580
It's like my right eye is on fire.

134
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,630
And I can see some words.

135
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,630
Don't think!

136
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,340
Empty your mind!

137
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,880
What's happening to you

138
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,800
is probably some kind of psychological barrier
that activates when you try to defy the Church.

139
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,760
If you keep thinking about it,
your eye's going to burst!

140
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,220
How cruel.

141
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,890
What a cruel thing to do.

142
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:41,190
For not only my memories, but even my mind
to be controlled by someone else.

143
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:47,950
The one who burned this red sacred script
onto my eye...

144
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,330
was it the pontifex?

145
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,920
No, I don't think it was her.

146
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,460
It's one of the entities who created this world
and observes it from the outside.

147
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,340
One of the gods
that don't appear in the creation story.

148
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,720
Gods...

149
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:14,230
We Integrity Knights have fought endlessly
to protect the world that the gods created,

150
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,980
and yet they refuse to trust us?

151
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,900
Robbing me of my memories
of my family and my sister,

152
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,700
and on top of that,
placing such a seal on me

153
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,870
to force me to obey... how dare they.

154
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,040
I'm not a puppet!

155
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,330
Even if I am an entity created by another,

156
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,040
I still have a mind of my own!

157
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:43,010
I want to protect this world
and the people who live in it!

158
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,930
That's the one and only mission I must carry out!

159
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:48,890
Alice!

160
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:54,810
Kirito.

161
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,190
Hold me down firmly.

162
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,560
Right.

163
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,860
Pontifex Administrator,
as well as you nameless gods...

164
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,780
in order to accomplish what I must do,

165
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,990
I will fight you!

166
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,670
Eugeo.

167
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,050
Eugeo!

168
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,730
You must be cold over there.

169
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,850
Now then, come here, Eugeo.

170
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,200
Mom? Is that you, Mom?

171
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,710
That's right. I'm your mother, Eugeo.

172
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,670
But where's Dad?

173
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,420
Where did my brothers go?

174
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,260
You silly child.

175
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,890
You killed them all, remember?

176
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,530
<i>What happened to me?</i>

177
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,490
<i>What am I doing here?</i>

178
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,450
<i>Bercouli, the knight commander...</i>

179
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,910
<i>I fought the hero of the old legend.</i>

180
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,000
<i>And afterward, a little man named Chudelkin
or something showed up.</i>

181
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,290
I can't remember what happened after that.

182
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,210
Is this...

183
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,760
<i>Is this the top floor of the Central Cathedral?</i>

184
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,490
<i>If I'm on the top floor of the Cathedral,
then that's...</i>

185
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,760
<i>No, Eugeo! Run!</i>

186
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,720
<i>This person is the pontifex, Administrator.</i>

187
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,100
<i>If I do it now...</i>

188
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,230
<i>But this is for Alice, I can't use it now.</i>

189
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,530
<i>Eugeo, run!</i>

190
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,260
You poor child.

191
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,720
Huh? Poor?

192
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,100
That's right. So very pitiful.

193
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,180
You're just like a withered potted flower.

194
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,310
A potted... flower?

195
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:30,190
And you know very well yourself.
How you thirst... how you starve.

196
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,030
For what?

197
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,740
For love.

198
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,990
Did you say love?

199
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,070
You make it sound like I don't know what love is.

200
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:44,830
That's right. You're a pitiful child
who doesn't known what it's like to be loved.

201
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,000
That's not true! My mom loved me.

202
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,050
Whenever I had a nightmare and couldn't sleep,

203
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,760
she'd hold me and sing me lullabies!

204
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:00,550
But was that love really meant only for you?

205
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,930
You know it wasn't.

206
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:05,350
It was what was left over
from what she'd divided among your brothers.

207
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,820
That's a lie! Mom loved only me.

208
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:17,030
You wanted her to love only you.
But she wouldn't do that.

209
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,160
That's why you hated them.

210
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,160
Your father and your older brothers
who stole your mother's love.

211
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:28,370
That's a lie! I... I don't hate my father
or my brothers at all!

212
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,250
Is that true?

213
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,090
After all, you did slash him.

214
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,800
Who?

215
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:39,800
That red-haired girl might've been
the first person who loved you and no one else.

216
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:45,890
When that man tried to take her away by force
and defile her, you tried to slash him.

217
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,140
Because you hated him.

218
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,270
Because he'd taken something
that was only yours.

219
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,820
You're wrong.
That's not why I raised my sword against Raios!

220
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,660
But your thirst remains unquenched.

221
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,700
No one will ever love you.
They've all forgotten about you.

222
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,370
"We don't need you anymore," they said,
and discarded you.

223
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,960
That's not true. That's not true.

224
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,210
I... I haven't been discarded.

225
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,630
That's right. It's not true. I have Alice.

226
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,550
Is that really true?

227
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:26,100
Does that girl really love only you, I wonder?

228
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,690
You've forgotten.

229
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,850
I'll help you to remember.

230
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:37,490
The real memories you've buried
deep inside your heart!

231
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:48,200
<i>I haven't seen Kirito or Alice all morning.
Where could they be?</i>

232
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,380
A—

233
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,130
Hey, let's head back now. Or they'll find out.

234
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:03,220
We still have time.
A little longer... just a little bit, okay?

235
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,180
That's a lie.

236
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,390
<i>This is all lies!</i>

237
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,100
See? I told you.

238
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,990
Do you understand now?

239
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,820
Even that girl's love doesn't belong to you alone.

240
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:29,040
No. Actually, did she even have any for you
from the start?

241
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,500
But I'm different, Eugeo.

242
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,710
I'm willing to love you.

243
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:40,840
I'll give all of my love to you. Only you.

244
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,050
Only me?

245
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,240
Now, come here, Eugeo.

246
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:09,950
Now you can experience the joy
of being loved to your heart's content.

247
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:16,130
And if you love me,
I'll return that same amount of love.

248
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:22,800
The deeper your love for me,
the more I'll bring you to the ultimate pleasure,

249
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,430
one beyond your imagination!

250
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,850
<i>Is that really what love is?</i>

251
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,770
<i>Is it like money,
that you use to buy things of value?</i>

252
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,020
<i>Is that all there is to it?</i>

253
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,610
Eugeo-senpai.

254
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,030
That's not what it is, Eugeo-senpai!

255
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,660
You're wrong, Eugeo!

256
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,880
Love isn't something you can get as a reward!

257
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,550
Eugeo!

258
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,370
Don't you want it, Eugeo?

259
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:42,710
To forget everything that causes you sorrow,
and consume all of my love?

260
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,050
But not yet.

261
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:48,760
Didn't I tell you? First, you have to love me.

262
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:52,930
Now, chant exactly what I say.

263
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,810
Be thinking that you trust only me,
and you're offering yourself to me fully.

264
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:01,400
Now... First, the initial line of the sacred art.

265
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,980
System Call.

266
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,530
That's right. Now keep going.

267
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,450
Remove Core Protection.

268
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,030
Remove...

269
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,490
<i>Was this the best thing to do?</i>

270
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,450
Core...

271
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:22,040
<i>But I don't want to be sad
or in pain anymore.</i>

272
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,340
That's right.
Now, come to me, Eugeo. Into me.

273
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,130
Into eternal stasis.

274
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,390
...Protection.

275
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,060
Next time: Synthesis.
