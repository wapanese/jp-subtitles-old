1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,730
Enhance Armament!

2
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,370
Kirito!

3
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,950
Kirito!

4
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,660
Are you all right? Kirito!

5
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,010
The Osmanthus Knight

6
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,470
Kirito!

7
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,010
Kirito!

8
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,520
System Call. Generate Luminous Element!

9
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:03,070
System Call.
Transfer Human Unit Durability, Self to Left!

10
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,540
Kirito.

11
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,500
Thanks, Eugeo.

12
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,920
I'll be okay now.

13
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,920
Hey, don't overdo it.

14
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,090
After all that,
you probably have internal wounds we can't see.

15
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,890
It's not as bad as what the goblins did.

16
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,970
Anyway, I'm more worried about her.

17
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,140
But she...

18
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,100
But she tried to kill you.

19
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,360
You just said that
you can't defeat someone with hatred.

20
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:46,830
True, I don't think that Integrity Knight was driven
by any personal grudges or hate. But...

21
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,080
But I... just can't bring myself
to forgive the Church or the Integrity Knights!

22
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,630
Not just their devastating power,
but also what they aspire to.

23
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,670
If they really have the desire
to protect the Human Empire,

24
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,050
why wouldn't they use that power for more...

25
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,600
I'm sure those knights are struggling
with their own conflicts.

26
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,230
I think we'll learn more about that
if we meet up with their commander.

27
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,900
Eugeo, your Perfect Weapon Control art
was incredible.

28
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,240
You're the one who defeated those knights.

29
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,950
So now...

30
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,700
you have no reason to hate Fanatio as a human
or the Four Whirling Blades anymore.

31
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,250
Human. Yeah, I guess so.

32
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,330
That's the one thing I sensed during our battle.

33
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,500
She was human.

34
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,590
That's why she was so powerful.

35
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,390
That's exactly right.
They see themselves as absolute good,

36
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,560
but to you they must've been absolute evil,

37
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,600
but you, me and those Integrity Knights
are all human.

38
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,230
There's no way humans can determine
absolute good or evil.

39
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,110
Oh, I almost forgot.

40
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,610
Use that to counteract the poison in the kids.

41
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,620
Before you give it to them,
break the poisoned swords

42
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,290
and make sure
they don't have anything else suspicious.

43
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,580
<i>Kirito.</i>

44
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:20,710
<i>Can you feel the same way,
even towards the pontifex, Administrator?</i>

45
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,140
System Call! Generate Luminous Element!

46
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,820
Kirito!

47
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,070
Help me! I can't stop the bleeding!

48
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,280
All right.

49
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,000
It's useless, Kirito. She's lost too much blood.

50
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,080
But... if she dies, she'll be erased.

51
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,840
After living for a hundred years,
wavering, falling in love, suffering...

52
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,420
I can't erase a soul like that!

53
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,890
Can you hear me? Anyone at all!

54
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,350
I know there are more of you Integrity Knights!

55
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,600
Come save your companion!

56
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,810
A monk or priest! Somebody come help!

57
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,280
I'm begging you,
if you're watching, come help us!

58
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,360
That's right!

59
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,540
You can't, Kirito!
You're supposed to use it on Administrator!

60
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,620
I know that!

61
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,500
But I can save her if I use this.

62
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,210
I can't have a way to save her and not use it!

63
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,140
Jeez, you really are something else.

64
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,900
Cardinal, is that you?

65
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,110
I'm sorry. I just...

66
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,360
There's no point in apologizing now.
I understand the situation.

67
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,700
I agree to undertake the treatment
of Fanatio Synthesis Two.

68
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:18,410
However, since a full recovery will take some time,
I'll take her body into my care.

69
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:30,340
As far as I can tell, it's highly likely
that Administrator is still in her unawakened state.

70
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,550
If you can make it to the top floor
before she awakens,

71
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,470
you can still eliminate her
without using the dagger.

72
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,980
Hurry. There are only
a few more Integrity Knights left.

73
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,360
Sorry I lost control, Eugeo.

74
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,860
No, there's nothing to apologize for.

75
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,660
Now that I think of it,
Cardinal said something strange.

76
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,040
Something about Administrator's
unawakened state...

77
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,880
Did she mean she's asleep?

78
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,260
Cardinal told me Administrator and the Integrity Knights
have to strain their resources in various ways

79
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,180
in order to be able to live for centuries.

80
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,640
Administrator especially
spends most of the day sleeping, it seems.

81
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,350
Well, I guess we'll find out
when we get up there.

82
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,080
What's this?

83
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,510
Hey, something's coming!

84
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,660
Thank you for your patience.
Which floor would you like to visit?

85
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,410
Did you say which floor?

86
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,670
Does that mean you're going to take us
to the higher floors?

87
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:35,550
Um, we're fugitives who broke into the Cathedral.

88
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,890
You sure that elevaâ€” uh, not that...

89
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,350
You sure it's okay
to let us ride that floating platform?

90
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,600
My job is only to operate this floating platform.

91
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,690
I've received no other orders.

92
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,440
Is that so? Then we'll accept your offer.

93
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,490
Hey!

94
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,530
Are you sure it's okay?

95
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,240
There doesn't seem to be
any other way up.

96
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,540
That's... You have a point, but...

97
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,960
Okay then, can you take us
as high as you're able?

98
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,670
Understood.

99
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,170
System Call. Generate Aerial Element.

100
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,550
Burst Element.

101
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,070
How long have you been doing this?

102
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,240
This year marks the one-hundred-and-seventh year
since I received this Calling.

103
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,660
O-One hundred and seven years?

104
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,410
And you've been operating this floating platform
that entire time?

105
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,960
Not the entire time.

106
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,210
I am granted a lunch break at noon,

107
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,420
and I sleep at night, of course.

108
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,380
No, that's not what I meant.

109
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,550
What's your name?

110
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,590
My name is...

111
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,470
I've forgotten it.

112
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:09,690
Everyone calls me the Operator.

113
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,860
Um... So, we're on our way to defeat
an important person in the Axiom Church.

114
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,240
The one who assigned you this Calling.

115
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,240
Is that so?

116
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:29,660
If the Church ceases to exist and you're released
from this Calling, what would you do?

117
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:31,960
Released?

118
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:38,050
I have no knowledge of the world
other than this shaft.

119
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,430
Therefore, I cannot say
what new Calling I would choose.

120
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,310
But if you mean what I wish to try, then...

121
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:58,900
I would like to fly freely through the sky
on this floating platform.

122
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,330
Thank you for your patience.

123
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,790
This is the eightieth floor, the Cloudtop Garden.

124
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:21,630
I used to think that nothing could be
more endless then my previous Calling.

125
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,390
But it was a gift
to be able to retire when I got old.

126
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,810
Compared to that girl's Calling...

127
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:33,980
Cardinal said that even if you freeze
the natural degradation of life with a spell,

128
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,650
you can't stop the soul from aging.

129
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,400
The memory is affected bit by bit,

130
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,820
until it's destroyed in the end.

131
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,280
What the Axiom Church is doing is wrong.

132
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,290
That's why you and I came all this way
to defeat Administrator.

133
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,540
But...

134
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,170
But that doesn't mean
things will end there, Eugeo.

135
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,460
The real challenge is still ahead.

136
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:04,630
As long as we defeat Administrator,
can't we let Cardinal handle the rest?

137
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,560
No. I'll explain after we get Alice back.

138
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,970
Kirito?

139
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,790
This is...

140
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,450
Alice.

141
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,990
Please wait a little longer.

142
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,910
Since the weather's so nice,

143
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,290
I want to give it ample time
to bask in the sunlight.

144
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,670
Don't fight, Eugeo.

145
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,930
Just focus on piercing Alice with Cardinal's dagger,
no matter what.

146
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:32,890
I'll block her attacks,
even if it means risking my life.

147
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:34,970
But...

148
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,350
There's no other way.

149
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,730
I'll take Alice's first strike intentionally
and then restrain her,

150
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,860
so use that dagger immediately. Got that?

151
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,230
Sorry.

152
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,940
No need to apologize.

153
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,400
You're paying me back double
as soon as I can make you!

154
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,530
She doesn't seem to have her sword.

155
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,620
If we attack now, she won't have time
to recite the Perfect Weapon Control command.

156
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,580
To be honest,
it'd be best if we didn't have to use it.

157
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,590
I guess you're right.

158
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:07,050
Even though I think I can use
my Perfect Weapon Control art two more times

159
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,130
without restoring its life
using the scabbard.

160
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,850
That will help. I can only use mine once more.

161
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,810
And after Alice, we'll still have to deal
with the knights' commander.

162
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,270
All right, let's go.

163
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,770
I see you've climbed all the way to these heights.

164
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,320
Even if you did manage
to escape the underground prison,

165
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,700
I expected Eldrie to be able
to deal with you on his own.

166
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:41,370
Yet you two overcame him, Sir Deusolbert,
and even cut down Sir Fanatio,

167
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,290
before setting foot in the Cloudtop Garden.

168
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,260
What is imbuing you with such power?

169
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:53,090
Why are you disrupting the order
of the Human Empire?

170
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,930
As I thought,
I can only ask you with my sword.

171
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,140
Don't tell me...

172
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,070
Don't tell me that sword...

173
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,110
is already under Perfect Weapon Control?

174
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,190
Could it be you're mocking me?

175
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,570
To run towards me
without drawing your swords...

176
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,360
I held back on that attack as a warning.

177
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,160
But with my next attack,
I shall erase all of your life.

178
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,120
Show me the full extent of your power,

179
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,120
for the sake of the knights you've defeated, as well.

180
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,500
System Call.

181
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:15,510
We apologize for showing such disrespect
to an honorable Integrity Knight.

182
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:23,060
I, Disciple Kirito, formally challenge you,
Knight Alice, to a fair duel.

183
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,640
Very well.

184
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:31,150
I shall test the limits of your evil designs
through your swordsmanship.

185
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,250
Tell me one thing.

186
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:49,590
I assume the tree we saw on top of the hill earlier
was your Divine Object's ancient form.

187
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,760
How can such a small tree wield so much power?

188
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,720
In ancient times,
the spot where the Central Cathedral now stands

189
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:05,430
was the Place of Beginning bestowed upon humans
by Stacia, the Goddess of Creation.

190
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,520
A beautiful spring gushed
in the center of a tiny village,

191
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,780
and on its banks grew a single Osmanthus tree.

192
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,530
That tree was the original form of my Divine Object,
the Osmanthus Blade.

193
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,740
The reincarnated form of a tree
created by God.

194
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,370
It is the oldest existence in creation.

195
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,250
Its attribute is "everlasting eternity."

196
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:35,840
Even a single fluttering petal can split rock
or pierce the ground it touches.

197
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:42,430
I see. So it's the first indestructible object
installed by God.

198
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,060
Not that I can afford to be amazed.

199
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,810
Now then, Integrity Knight Alice.
Once again, I challenge you!

200
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:27,220
You're the second person
to have withstood my attacks this long.

201
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,940
You must've climbed this tower
with such resolve and conviction.

202
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,190
But it's not nearly enough to sway the Church.

203
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:40,070
I cannot allow you two to disturb the peace
of the Human Empire.

204
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,490
Now then... prepare yourself.

205
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,340
Enhance Armament!

206
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,880
That was rather entertaining,

207
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:48,350
but you have no hope of stopping my flowers
with mere ice.

208
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:53,060
I'll fight you next,
so stay there and wait your turn.

209
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,230
Enhance Armament!

210
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:05,870
<i>He aimed for the sword?</i>

211
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,450
Eugeo!

212
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,060
Kirito?

213
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,650
Alice?

214
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,750
Kirito!

215
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,970
Alice!

216
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,100
Next time: Truce.
