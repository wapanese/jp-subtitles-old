1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,480
I thought you'd come.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,650
If I tormented those children long enough,

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,190
I knew you'd emerge
from your musty hole sooner or later.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,320
Since I last saw you,
you've grown adept at imitating a human.

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,580
Oh my. And what about you, pipsqueak?

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,750
Why are you speaking to me
in that bizarre manner?

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,340
Two hundred years ago, when you were brought before me,
you were trembling and alone!

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,010
Right, Lyserith?

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,340
Don't call me by that name, Quinella!

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,220
My name is Cardinal.

11
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,560
I am the program that only exists to delete you.

12
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,520
Yes, that's right.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,310
And I am Administrator.

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,270
The one who controls all programs.

15
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,150
I apologize for not greeting you sooner, pipsqueak,

16
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,490
but I was preparing the command to welcome you,

17
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,620
and it took longer then expected.

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,960
Administrator

19
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,340
You disconnected the address, didn't you?

20
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,220
Two hundred years ago,
it was certainly a mistake to let you get away

21
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,600
when I was so close to killing you, pipsqueak.

22
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:28,770
And so,

23
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,110
I decided to learn from that mistake.

24
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:37,200
If I could someday lure you out,
I'd trap you on this side.

25
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,660
A mouse inside a cage
with the cat that hunts it.

26
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:47,160
But in this situation, it isn't clear
which of us is the cat, and which is the mouse, is it?

27
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:52,750
After all, there are four of us
and only one of you.

28
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,420
Four against one?

29
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,970
No, your calculations are a bit off.

30
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,640
What?

31
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:12,360
To be precise, it's four against three hundred,
not even including me.

32
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,820
Three hundred?

33
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,910
You... What...

34
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,950
What depths have you sunk to?

35
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,410
Are they not the very subjects
you should be protecting?

36
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,920
Subjects? Subjects, as in humans?

37
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,630
Which means that monster is human?

38
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,220
As if I would ever bother with petty matters
like "the subjects I should be protecting."

39
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,050
I am a ruler.

40
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:50,140
As long as those under my rule
exist in the lower world in the manner I desire,

41
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,770
whether human or sword,
then there's no need for concern.

42
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,440
You...

43
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:04,660
Oh my, you're not shocked by the matter conversion
of a measly three hundred human units, are you?

44
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,620
Did you say measly?

45
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,830
And this is only a prototype.

46
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,790
In order to mass-produce the finished version
to handle the awful load test,

47
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,260
I think I'll need at least half.

48
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,970
Half of what?

49
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,850
Half of the 80,000 or so human units
residing in the Human Empire.

50
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,230
That should be enough.

51
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,310
To repel the Dark Territory's invasion
and attack the other side.

52
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,030
Well? Are you satisfied, Alice?

53
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,280
Your precious Human Empire
will be well protected.

54
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,240
Your Eminence, Pontifex.

55
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,500
It's clear that the words of a human
can no longer reach you.

56
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,960
So I ask you as a user of the sacred arts.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,170
Where are the owners
of the thirty swords that make up that puppet?

58
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:07,180
Even if you've broken the rule
that only allows you full control of a single sword,

59
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,720
you can't break the next rule.

60
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,140
To perform Memory Release,

61
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,770
there must be a powerful bond
between the sword and its owner.

62
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:22,900
Your Eminence, if the source for the swords
that make up that puppet is innocent humans,

63
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,950
then it's not possible
for those swords to love you!

64
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,450
The answer is right before your eyes.

65
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,210
I'm sure Eugeo has already figured it out.

66
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,420
I see. So that's it.

67
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,380
Eugeo?

68
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,680
Kirito, the crystals in the ceiling.

69
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,810
They aren't just ornaments.

70
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,640
They're probably the memory fragments
stolen from the Integrity Knights.

71
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,520
Wha—

72
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:02,820
Curse you, Quinella! You've...
You've gone too far in your manipulation of humans!

73
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,280
By inserting the memory piece you extract
during the Synthesis Ritual into a mental model,

74
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,290
you can treat it as a simulated human unit.

75
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,370
But its intelligence would be severely limited.

76
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:21,050
It'd be unable to execute a complex command
like the Perfect Weapon Control art.

77
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:26,970
But it'd be different if the memory piece
and the data linked to weapon are almost the same.

78
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:27,930
In other words,

79
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,140
the beloved people in the memory pieces
you stole from the Integrity Knights

80
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,100
were your resources for creating those swords.

81
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,100
Isn't that right, Administrator?

82
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,990
The knights' simulated personas
desire only one thing.

83
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:50,990
To touch the one they recall,
hold them tight, and make them their own.

84
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:55,960
It's that unseemly desire
that moves this swordsman puppet.

85
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:03,840
Right now, they sense that person is near.
But they can't touch them. They can't be one.

86
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,720
Driven by maddening starvation and thirst,
the only thing they can see

87
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,300
is the enemy standing in their way.

88
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:15,020
If they annihilate that enemy,
the person they desire will be theirs.

89
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,180
So they fight.

90
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,150
No matter how badly they're wounded,
or how many times they fall,

91
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,690
they'll get back up and fight for eternity.

92
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:29,660
Well? Isn't it a wonderful mechanism?
The power of desire really is remarkable!

93
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,280
You're wrong!

94
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,500
Don't you dare taint that emotion
by calling it desire!

95
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,540
This is...

96
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,290
This is pure love!

97
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,170
They're the same thing, my foolish pipesqueak.

98
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,130
Love is control.

99
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,970
Love is desire.

100
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,390
In actual form, it's nothing more than a signal
output from the Fluctlight!

101
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,100
And most important of all...

102
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:08,860
now that you know that,
you can never destroy that puppet, no matter what.

103
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,110
And why?

104
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:15,530
Because that puppet's swords
are living human beings who've been transformed!

105
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,380
Yes... you're right.

106
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,590
I can't kill people.

107
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:32,470
I've spent the last two hundred years
devising an art to kill you, a nonhuman,

108
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,760
but it was all for nothing.

109
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,980
How foolish of you!
How completely comical!

110
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:48,690
All life in this world is nothing more
than aggregated data that can be overwritten.

111
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,200
No, they're still human, Quinella.

112
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:57,870
The people who live in the Underworld
possess the true emotions we lost.

113
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:01,580
Hearts that laugh, grieve, rejoice, and love.

114
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,420
What more do they need?

115
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,550
I will give you my life!

116
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,560
But in return,
I want you to spare the lives of these youngsters!

117
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,770
What are you—

118
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,360
What would I gain from accepting such terms?

119
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:35,070
If you wish to fight, then I assure you
I'll keep your pathetic doll's actions contained,

120
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,950
and shear off at least half of your life.

121
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:45,290
That much of a load will further strain
your dwindling memory capacity, wouldn't it?

122
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,090
Well, all right.

123
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,140
I can always save the fun for later, right?

124
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,970
All right. I swear on the goddess Stacia.
That after I—

125
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:08,440
No, not on any god, swear on the one thing
you value most of all, your own Fluctlight.

126
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,440
Fine, fine.

127
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:16,200
Then I swear on my Fluctlight
and all the precious data accumulated there.

128
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:21,450
After I've killed you,
I'll let the three behind you go unharmed.

129
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,870
Very well.

130
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,630
I'm sorry.

131
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,530
Is that it?

132
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,410
No matter how many times you strike me, I'll—

133
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,710
Of course I'm holding back, pipsqueak!

134
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,380
What fun would it be
to finish you right away?

135
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,970
I've been waiting two hundred years
for this moment, after all!

136
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,910
Stay back!

137
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,290
<i>I'm powerless.</i>

138
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,670
<i>I can't believe how powerless I am.</i>

139
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,590
<i>No, there has to be something I can do.</i>

140
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:03,220
<i>Instead of berating myself for being powerless,
I need to find a way to fight!</i>

141
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,220
Now, shall I finish this?

142
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,350
Farewell, Lyserith.

143
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,350
Farewell, my daughter.

144
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,060
And...

145
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,650
my other self!

146
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,550
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

147
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,720
Why would you apologize?

148
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:47,260
You still have a mission
you need to complete, don't you?

149
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,680
The three of you...

150
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,770
This fleeting, beautiful world...

151
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,650
No matter what...

152
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,610
No matter what...

153
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:03,570
we'll use these lives you gave us
to complete this mission.

154
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
<i>Eugeo.</i>

155
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,680
I... I just finally realized what my mission is.

156
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,600
I won't run.

157
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,390
I have a duty I must carry out.

158
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,610
Cardinal.

159
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:42,570
Please use your remaining power to transform me...
transform my body into a sword.

160
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,070
Just like that puppet.

161
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,460
Eugeo, are you...

162
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,460
If the three of us escape from here,

163
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:06,140
Administrator will transform half of the humans
in the world into terrifying monsters.

164
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:11,640
If there's one last chance remaining
to prevent that tragedy,

165
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,600
then... it must lie in this command.

166
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,810
System Call.

167
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,070
Remove Core Protection.

168
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,700
Please, Cardinal.

169
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,170
Our bond has to be far stronger
than the power driving that monster!

170
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,040
Don't! Stop it, Eugeo!

171
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:43,050
It's okay, Kirito. This is what I'm meant to do.

172
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,600
Very well, Eugeo.

173
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:01,770
I offer the final command of my life...
to your decision.

174
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,990
That's right. I need to tell you one last thing.

175
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:14,200
The pontifex is impervious to metal weapons.
That's why I couldn't stab her with my dagger.

176
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,570
What?

177
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,790
What are you doing, you half-dead runt?

178
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,870
No you don't!

179
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,010
Your lightning won't work on me!

180
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,380
You lowly puppet knight!

181
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,010
You say such impertinent things!

182
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,470
Then all of you can burn!

183
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,480
I said, no you don't!

184
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,930
Release... Recollection.

185
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,190
Even if you mimic my command,

186
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:10,190
a meager sword like that can't compete
with my weapon of utter destruction!

187
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,160
I'll snap it in two with a single blow!

188
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,090
Beautiful.

189
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:36,390
Human love,
and the light released by one's will...

190
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,970
It's so beautiful.

191
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,390
Yeah. It is.

192
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,310
Kirito, I'm leaving the rest to you.

193
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:52,950
Please protect this world and its people.

194
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,780
Eugeo.

195
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,740
Oh my!

196
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,200
You want to fight me, boy?

197
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:47,170
A little arrogant, when all you did was poke a gap
and destroy my puppet, wouldn't you say?

198
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,500
Stop.

199
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,840
Don't go.

200
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,220
Eugeo!

201
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:05,770
Eugeo!

202
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,780
You wretched brat!

203
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,340
The sword that was converted with Eugeo's body,

204
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:28,560
in terms of priority, it was no match
for my Silvery Eternity, so this is a surprise.

205
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:35,520
And not recognizing that the sword
wasn't metallic was also mistake.

206
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,740
Now then.

207
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,200
That you'd be the last one standing

208
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,080
is something of a surprise as well,
boy from the other side.

209
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,340
Why you came all this way
without administrator privileges...

210
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,880
I admit I'm a little interested.

211
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,180
But I'm tired of all that now, and I'm sleepy.

212
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,970
I'll have that person give me
a full account later,

213
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:13,440
and bring this battle to an end
with your blood and screams.

214
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,240
Farewell, boy.

215
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,450
Let's meet again someday on the other side.

216
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,250
<i>How many times...</i>

217
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,960
<i>am I going to make the same mistake?</i>

218
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,130
There's no need to win every time.

219
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,970
Even if you fall, if you're defeated one day,

220
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:51,310
it's enough if your heart,
your will is connected to another.

221
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:57,820
I'm sure everyone who's spent time with you
but left felt that way.

222
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,650
As do I, of course.

223
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,780
Therefore, you can stand again.

224
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,740
To protect someone you love.

225
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,430
What?

226
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,310
You can still move after all?

227
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,940
Yeah. Leave the rest to me.

228
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,270
I think I will.

229
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,870
Thanks, Alice. You can rest.

230
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:54,750
This life that Charlotte, Cardinal, and Eugeo
entrusted me with,

231
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,080
I'll connect it to you.

232
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,930
Next time: My Hero.
