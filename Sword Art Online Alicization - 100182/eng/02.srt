1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,980
March 19, year 378 in the time
of the realm of humanity

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,290
Where... am I?

3
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,760
<i>I remember being at Agil's place.</i>

4
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,840
<i>Then leaving with Asuna.</i>

5
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,970
<i>But I can't remember what happened next.</i>

6
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,610
<i>This outfit...</i>

7
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,980
<i>Am I inside a game?</i>

8
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,860
Command.

9
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,740
Log out.

10
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,830
<i>Way too realistic to be a 3D object.</i>

11
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,920
<i>So this isn't a game?</i>

12
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,510
<i>Am I dreaming, or— A dream?</i>

13
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,890
<i>That's it. This is the virtual world
created by the STL, the Underworld!</i>

14
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,220
<i>No, but something's off.</i>

15
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,440
<i>While I'm diving in the STL,
my memories of the real world should be blocked.</i>

16
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,650
<i>But I remember meeting up
with Asuna and Sinon.</i>

17
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,940
Mr. Kikuoka! Mr. Higa!

18
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,950
Abort the dive for now!

19
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,320
There seems to be a problem!

20
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,210
<i>Is this really a virtual world?</i>

21
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,110
What was that?

22
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,440
<i>I don't know why, but I feel so nostalgic...</i>

23
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,530
<i>and so frustrated.</i>

24
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:52,000
The Demon Tree

25
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,210
Who are you?

26
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,050
Where did you come from?

27
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,210
<i>A test player, like me?</i>

28
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,300
<i>Or maybe an NPC?</i>

29
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,970
What's wrong?

30
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,930
Um... My name is...

31
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,190
It's Kirito.

32
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,310
Kirito?

33
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,780
I was coming from over there,
but then I got lost.

34
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,950
Over there? South of the forest?

35
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,990
Did you come from Zakkaria?

36
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,120
N-No, that's not it.

37
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:16,040
The thing is, I don't know where I came from.

38
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,130
You don't know...
not even about the town you live in?

39
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,420
N-No, I don't remember.

40
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,880
When I came to, I was in the forest.

41
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,970
I can't believe it. I've heard the stories,
but I've never seen one before.

42
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,890
A lost child of Vecta.

43
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,520
V-Vecta?

44
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,980
Huh? Isn't that what they're called
in your homeland?

45
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,650
That's what people are called in my village

46
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,030
who suddenly vanish without a trace,
or suddenly show up in the forest or in a field.

47
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,490
The dark god, Vecta, likes to prank humans
by spiriting them away,

48
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,830
stealing their memories,
and leaving them somewhere far away.

49
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,990
R-Really?

50
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,250
Then maybe that's what I am.

51
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,260
<i>His facial expressions and responses
are way too natural for an NPC. Let me try.</i>

52
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,180
So you see, I'm in a bit of a bind.
So what I want...

53
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,850
...is to get out of here.

54
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,430
Is that so?

55
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
Well, this is a vast forest.

56
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,730
You're bound to get lost
if you don't know the way.

57
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,650
But don't worry.

58
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,820
- There's a path that leads to the north.
- N-No, actually...

59
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,410
I want to log out!

60
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,830
Log... What did you say?

61
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,790
<i>No good, huh?</i>

62
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:45,130
Sorry. Um... It means that I'd like
to find a place to stay in town.

63
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,760
Really? That's the first time
I've heard that phrase.

64
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,590
<i>Now what?</i>

65
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,850
<i>He could be a test player,
but they might've restricted his memories.</i>

66
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,480
My village is just to the north,

67
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,350
but we never get any travelers,
so there isn't an inn.

68
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:08,190
But if we explain the situation,
maybe Sister Azalia at the church will help you.

69
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,160
I-Is that right?
Then I'll try going to the village.

70
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,820
Hold on!

71
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:21,040
The men-at-arms there might not
let you into the village if you're alone.

72
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,540
I'll go with you and explain your situation.

73
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,380
That would be a big help. Thanks.

74
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:33,430
But I can't go with you right away,
since I still have work.

75
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,850
It's going to take another four hours or so.

76
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,440
That's okay, I'll wait.
Sorry, but thanks for your help.

77
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,270
I see! Okay, then have a seat somewhere.

78
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,360
I haven't told you my name yet, have I?

79
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,370
I'm Eugeo. Nice to meet you!

80
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,200
Eugeo. That sounds familiar.

81
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,040
What's wrong, Mr. Kirito?

82
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,210
N-Nice to meet you.

83
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,090
And just call me Kirito.

84
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,510
Yeah? Then you can call me Eugeo.

85
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,340
That's right.

86
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,510
You must be hungry.

87
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,980
Th-Thanks.

88
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,350
<i>At the very least, he's not an NPC.</i>

89
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,320
<i>But it's still not clear to me
if he's a test player or not. Or...</i>

90
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,780
<i>Maybe this isn't a virtual world, but reality?</i>

91
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:38,490
The only good thing about this bread
is that it keeps a long time, but to be safe...

92
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,080
<i>I think he went like this.</i>

93
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,590
<i>It's certain.</i>

94
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,300
<i>This is neither reality
or an alternate world.</i>

95
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,340
<i>It's a virtual world.</i>

96
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,760
Hey, Kirito.

97
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,060
You are at least familiar
with the Stacia Window, right?

98
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,100
O-Of course!

99
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,360
It's still got plenty of life left,
so you don't have to eat it in a hurry.

100
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,650
If it were summer,
no way would it keep this long.

101
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,950
Rock solid!

102
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,910
Not very tasty, is it?

103
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,830
I buy this bread at the bakery
on my way here,

104
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,790
but since it's so early,
there's only leftovers from the day before.

105
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,550
And there isn't enough time
to go back to the village at noon.

106
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,720
Then why don't you bring lunch from home?

107
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:45,180
Well, years ago, somebody used to
bring me lunch at noon every day.

108
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,900
What happened?

109
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,070
She was my childhood friend.

110
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,990
A girl, the same age as me.

111
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,570
When we were little,
we played together all the time.

112
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,330
Even after I received my Calling,
she'd bring me lunch every day.

113
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,000
But...

114
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,960
Because of me...

115
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:18,300
One day, the two of us went to a cave up north,
and she accidentally entered the Dark Territory.

116
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,680
A place that the Taboo Index forbids us
from ever setting foot in.

117
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,680
<i>Taboo Index?</i>

118
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,310
The next day,
an Integrity Knight arrived in the village...

119
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,820
...and she was taken away to the central city.

120
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,700
But you know, Kirito, I still believe.

121
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,320
That she's alive.

122
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,330
I just know Alice is alive
somewhere in the central city.

123
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,420
<i>Alice. I know that name.</i>

124
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,170
<i>Alice...</i>

125
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,590
Sorry.

126
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,390
For discussing something so strange.
It doesn't feel like I just met you.

127
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,140
Oh, no, I don't mind.

128
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,060
But if you really want to find out,
why don't you go look for her?

129
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,440
In this central city.

130
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Even with a fast horse, it would take a week
to get to the central city from my village.

131
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,360
Well, if you prepared for the journey...

132
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,780
I would if I could.

133
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:29,370
But shirking my Calling to go on a journey
would be a Taboo Index violation.

134
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,580
Th-That's a good point.

135
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,330
Um...

136
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:39,170
So when was Alice taken away
to the central city?

137
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:44,600
The summer I was eleven, so six years ago.

138
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,350
Thanks.

139
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,020
Right. Sorry about this,
but wait for me, okay?

140
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,770
And I'll get my work done.

141
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:00,190
By the way, Eugeo, your work...
your Calling. What is it?

142
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,950
Oh, didn't I tell you?

143
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,560
So your Calling is to be a woodcutter?

144
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,890
Well, I guess you could call it that.

145
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:37,520
Not that I've cut down a single tree
in the seven years since I received my Calling.

146
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,360
This colossal tree is called the Gigas Cedar.

147
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,240
But most of the villagers...

148
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,200
...call it the demon tree.

149
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:52,160
See, this tree sucks up all of Terraria's blessings
from its surroundings.

150
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:58,170
So as long as this tree is standing,
we'll never be able to expand our wheat fields.

151
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,510
And so the village sent for
that Dragonbone Ax from the central city,

152
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,880
so a dedicated carver could strike it every day.

153
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,590
That's me.

154
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,060
You mean you've been chopping this tree
every day for seven years?

155
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,890
After seven years, this is all you could manage?

156
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,230
Hardly.

157
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,770
I'm the seventh-generation carver.

158
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,070
For 300 years, generations of carvers
have chopped away every day,

159
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,820
and this is how far we've gotten.

160
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,120
Th-Three hundred years?

161
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,450
Hey, Eugeo.

162
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,750
Would you mind letting me try?

163
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,460
I mean, you did give me half of your lunch.

164
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,340
So I should do half of your work, right?

165
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:51,140
Well, it doesn't say in the Taboo Index
that you can't have someone help with your Calling...

166
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,480
But it's harder than it looks, you know.

167
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,190
You never know until you try, right?

168
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,710
Ouch!

169
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,840
You don't have to laugh that hard...

170
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,710
No, I'm sorry.

171
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,970
You're putting too much power
into your shoulders and hips.

172
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,050
Try to relax your whole body.

173
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,140
<i>That's right, this is a virtual world.</i>

174
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,810
<i>Think in terms of your avatar,
not your physical body.</i>

175
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,400
<i>Sword skill... Smash!</i>

176
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,460
That was pretty good.

177
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,510
All right, before you forget, do it again.

178
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,670
Fif... ty!

179
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,050
Okay, that's 1,000.

180
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,220
What, we've already done that many?

181
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,020
Yeah. 500 for me, 500 for you.

182
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,690
Strike the Gigas Cedar 2,000 times
in the morning and afternoon.

183
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,650
That's my Calling.

184
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,240
<i>Two thousand times...</i>

185
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,530
You're a natural, Kirito.

186
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,950
Thanks to you, I had an easy day today.

187
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,700
No, but...

188
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,410
I'm sure you would've been done sooner
if it was just you.

189
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,380
I know!
Let me show you something interesting.

190
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,050
It's only gone down by about 50 since last month.

191
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,260
You get it now, don't you?

192
00:15:53,430 --> 00:16:00,270
Even if you don't get a lot done in half a day,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

193
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:02,980
All right, then.

194
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,440
Shouldn't you lock that?

195
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,150
What for?

196
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,110
What do you mean? So no one steals it.

197
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:16,580
No need to worry!
It says in the Taboo Index not to steal, remember?

198
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,790
Y-Yeah, I guess.

199
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,790
All right, let's head to the village.

200
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,080
H-Hey...

201
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,580
Hey, wait up!

202
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,850
Hey, Eugeo.

203
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,810
Who's that?

204
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,520
Zink.

205
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,400
This is Kirito.

206
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,740
He seems to be a lost child of Vecta.

207
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,450
Hey, you really can't remember anything?

208
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,370
N-No.

209
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,290
You even forgot your Calling?

210
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,160
That's right.

211
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,710
Well, it probably wasn't a decent Calling anyway.

212
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,590
Just like Eugeo there.

213
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,470
It must've been one pointless, futile job!

214
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,050
- Unlike my Calling, man-at-arms—
- Swordsman.

215
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,770
My Calling... I think I was a swordsman.

216
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:27,980
Swordsman? A scrawny, weak-looking guy like you
can wield a sword?

217
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,200
Then why don't you show me?

218
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,250
<i>A one-handed sword this time, huh?</i>

219
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,140
<i>Was that a...</i>

220
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,480
<i>...light effect?</i>

221
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,190
<i>Sword skills exist in this world?</i>

222
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,570
That was amazing, Kirito!

223
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,490
I didn't know you could use a skill like that!

224
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,820
Maybe you were a sentinel in some big city?

225
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,660
M-Maybe so.

226
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,910
Zink?

227
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,330
That's enough, right?
I'm going to let Kirito into the village.

228
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,420
I'm tired.

229
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,050
We're finally here, huh?

230
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,390
Yeah, but...

231
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:46,680
Nobody in the village even doubts
that I'm a lost child of Vecta, huh?

232
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,230
Well, you are, right?

233
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,150
Uh, yeah, but...

234
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,280
Enough of that kind of talk,
I'm getting the Sister.

235
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,700
What is it?

236
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,120
U-Uh...

237
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,460
Here you go. A pillow and blanket.

238
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,260
Prayers start at six in the morning.
Breakfast is at seven.

239
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,430
I'll come check on you,
but try to get up on your own.

240
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:29,390
If you're late for prayers because you overslept,
Sister Azalia can be really scary!

241
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,940
There's a curfew after lights out,
so be mindful of that.

242
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,360
- We're caught!
- Run!

243
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,070
Um... do you have any other questions?

244
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,910
I'm okay. Thanks for everything.

245
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,370
Good night, then.

246
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,500
You know how to put out the lamp, right?

247
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,960
Yeah. Good night, Selka.

248
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,300
<i>This isn't the real world.</i>

249
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,890
<i>And there isn't a single NPC in this village.</i>

250
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:17,270
<i>Even so, there can't be enough STLs
to allow every villager to log in as a tester.</i>

251
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,110
<i>According to Eugeo...</i>

252
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:26,950
<i>...more than 300 years have passed
in this universe.</i>

253
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,500
<i>And Eugeo has spent at least six years here.</i>

254
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,840
<i>If that's true, then Eugeo and the others...</i>

255
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,940
<i>Eugeo and the others were raised here
from the start.</i>

256
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:59,730
<i>So they must be copies of the souls of newborns
who were then raised in this virtual world.</i>

257
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,900
<i>In other words, Artificial Fluctlights.</i>

258
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:05,740
<i>It's hard to believe,
but there's no other explanation.</i>

259
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,160
<i>But why would they do such a thing?</i>

260
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:12,620
<i>And just how fast has time been accelerated
in this world?</i>

261
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:19,550
<i>What would happen if I lived out my life here
before getting back to reality?</i>

262
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:26,050
<i>I might be able to contact Kikuoka
in a bigger city.</i>

263
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,680
<i>Right now,
I don't have the money to go on a journey,</i>

264
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,930
<i>and I don't know enough about this world.</i>

265
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:41,280
<i>But if I had someone's help...
maybe I can get to this so-called central city.</i>

266
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,810
Next episode: The End Mountains.
