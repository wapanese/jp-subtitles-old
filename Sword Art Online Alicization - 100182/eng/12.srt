1
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,600
Eldrie?

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,150
I've heard that name...

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,060
Eugeo.

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,690
We're going to fight him.
I'll face him first,

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,110
and you wait for my signal.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,030
All right.

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,080
You're going to use those chains
as your weapons?

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,000
Then let me fight not with my sword,
but with this instead.

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,500
System Call! Enhance Armament!

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,050
Don't worry.

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,840
If it's a whip, as long as
we keep an eye on the distance...

12
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,260
...it can't possibâ€”

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,100
<i>It extended?</i>

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:47,150
Ah, so you managed to withstand a blow
from my Divine Object, the Frostscale Whip at first sight?

15
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,980
Kirito!

16
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,530
These class-38 chains...

17
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,860
Eugeo. I'll find a way to stop his whip,
so you strike him.

18
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,410
Are you done discussing, prisoners?

19
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,960
Now then... try to keep me
at least somewhat entertained!

20
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,010
The Sage of the Library

21
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,470
System Call!

22
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,060
Generate Thermal Element!

23
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,060
Generate Cryogenic Element.

24
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,030
Form Element, Arrow Shape!

25
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,240
Form Element, Bird Shape.

26
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,990
Counter Thermal Object.

27
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,870
Discharge!

28
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,830
Discharge.

29
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,390
Did I overestimate you after all?

30
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,860
Allow me to show you some mercy.

31
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,780
I'll knock you unconsciousness quickly.

32
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,660
Not done yet!

33
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,550
Perhaps I should take back what I said
about underestimating you?

34
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,300
To think you could inflict such a wound on me!

35
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,340
Thanks, I guess.

36
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:10,810
Still, that move... that combat style...
Strangely enough, it seems familiar to me...

37
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:16,560
Oh yeah? Then maybe you've fought a swordsman
of the Serlut style before.

38
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,190
That's not possible, prisoner.

39
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:25,280
I was summoned to the human realm
as an Integrity Knight only one month ago.

40
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,780
This summoning...

41
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:34,040
It sounds like somebody ordered you
to come to this human realm.

42
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,350
Release Recollection.

43
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,320
No wonder Lady Alice was cautious of you.

44
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,580
That attack has no form or anything,
but that's why it exceeded my expectations.

45
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,580
To think that you made me use
my secret skill, Memory Release!

46
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,790
Now I remember.

47
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,590
From the start, I knew I'd heard that name before.

48
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,840
You were this year's Norlangarth North Empire
top representative swordsman,

49
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,220
and the winner
of the Four-Empire Unification Tournament...

50
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,930
Eldrie Woolsburg.

51
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,690
Me, the North Empire representative swordsman?

52
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,860
Eldrie Woolsburg...

53
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,570
That's right.

54
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:46,320
If I remember correctly, you won every match
with a single point using your graceful sword skills.

55
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,030
What are you talking about?

56
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,160
I'm the Integrity Knight
Eldrie Synthesis Thirty-One!

57
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,830
I've never heard it! The name Woolsburg!

58
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,120
But...

59
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,380
Never heard of it!
I... I've never heard of it.

60
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:05,550
I... was invited by the pontifex, Administrator

61
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:10,140
to descend upon this land from the heavens
as an Integrity Knight!

62
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,240
Wh-What just...

63
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,160
<i>Did Alice lose her memories
and change personalities because of that?</i>

64
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:35,950
Eldrie!

65
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,290
Eldrie Woolsburg!

66
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,290
Eugeo, do you know anything else?

67
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,670
It can be anything.
You have to revive more of his memories!

68
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,800
Eldrie!

69
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,850
You're the son of the general
of the Imperial Knight Order, Eschdor Woolsburg!

70
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,760
Your mother's name is... I think... Almera?

71
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,980
Right, it's Almera!

72
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,060
Al... me... ra.

73
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,110
Mo... ther.

74
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,280
That's right, remember...

75
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,620
...everything!

76
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,780
Kirito!

77
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,090
Kirito!

78
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:32,890
You criminals. Step away from Knight Thirty-One!

79
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:39,100
You won't be forgiven for the sin of tempting
a brilliant Integrity Knight to fall from grace.

80
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,020
After piercing all four of your limbs,
I shall throw you back into your cell!

81
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,480
Run!

82
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,570
<i>A fork in the road.</i>

83
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,570
<i>Go right!</i>

84
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,740
Eugeo, go right!

85
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,960
Kirito! Up ahead!

86
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,420
It's a dead end!

87
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,090
Hey!

88
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,840
This way!

89
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,340
<i>Dive!</i>

90
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,280
Ouch!

91
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,320
Where are we?

92
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,870
We've been detected.
Can't use this back door anymore.

93
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,050
Um, thank you for rescuing us. Uh...

94
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,220
It's nice to meet you. I'm Eugeo.

95
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,390
H-Hey!

96
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,140
And this is Kirito.

97
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,520
Thanks. You saved us.

98
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,320
Um, do you live here?

99
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,530
Of course not.

100
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,990
Come with me.

101
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,040
Is this inside the Central Cathedral now?

102
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,540
You could say that it is.
You could also say that it isn't.

103
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,010
As I've deleted the regular door,
although this place exists inside the cathedral,

104
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,800
no one is able to enter.

105
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,510
Unless it's at my invitation.

106
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,490
A great... library?

107
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,570
Indeed.

108
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,780
The records of all history,

109
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,870
and the structural formulae of all things under the heavens
since this world was created,

110
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:09,170
as well as every system command,
or what you call the sacred arts, are stored here.

111
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,250
Wh-Who are you, exactly?

112
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,800
My name is Cardinal.

113
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,840
I was once the regulator of the world,

114
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,680
now I am the sole librarian of this great library.

115
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,850
All history?

116
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,560
Yes. Even the creation account
from when the gods Stacia and Vecta

117
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,110
divided the world into the realm of humanity
and the realm of darkness are recorded here.

118
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,860
You may read them if you wish.

119
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,410
But first, both of you hold out your right hands.

120
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,200
There.

121
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,790
Are you okay, Eugeo?

122
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,710
Yeah.

123
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,510
Looks like you need to warm yourself up.

124
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,810
It's not spacious, but beyond that corridor,
there's a bathroom. Go on now.

125
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:10,520
Thank you.
I'll gladly accept your kind offer.

126
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,150
Also, Ms. Cardinal...

127
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,360
Um, well...

128
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,900
Beyond those stairs is the history gallery.

129
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,530
I'll get you something to eat after you bathe.

130
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,370
Thank you very much!

131
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,750
Please excuse me for a bit.

132
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,220
Although the records here were, unfortunately,
fabricated by the pontifex of the Axiom Church.

133
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,050
So no gods exist in this world, then?

134
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,180
None.

135
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,230
The myths that
the Underworld people believe in

136
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,190
are merely the propaganda spun by the church
to cement its rule.

137
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:58,940
Although the names of the gods have been registered
as super accounts for emergencies,

138
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,860
no human from the outside world
has logged in through that.

139
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,290
So you're not a resident of the Underworld.

140
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:13,500
You're an existence close to the system supervisors
from the outside world!

141
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,500
Indeed. And you're the same as well, right?

142
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,800
Unregistered resident Kirito.

143
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,680
Yeah, that's right.

144
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,560
The name of the people
who created the Underworld is Rath. Am I right?

145
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,600
Indeed.

146
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,270
And you're the Cardinal System.

147
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,560
An autonomous program
to control the virtual world.

148
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,060
Oh? So you know about that?

149
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,530
Have you contacted my counterparts
on the other side?

150
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,780
Well, yeah.

151
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:50,660
But as far I know, the Cardinal System never had
an anthropomorphic interface built in.

152
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,040
So what kind of an existence are you?

153
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,670
What are you doing here?

154
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,380
Let me be as succinct as possible.

155
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,470
First, eat.

156
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,770
Since I've cast a spell on it,
those wounds will heal soon, too.

157
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,140
Wow, no wonder you're the supervisor.

158
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,270
I'm not the supervisor.

159
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,860
I can only manipulate the objects in this library.

160
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,700
Oh, can you get in contact with the real world?

161
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:31,910
Idiot! If I could, I wouldn't be confined
inside a dusty place like this for centuries.

162
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,710
Unfortunately, the only one
who has the means to do that is the pontifex.

163
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,420
I-Is that right?

164
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,710
There!

165
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,890
A moment ago,
I told you that no gods exist in this world.

166
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,470
But when this world was created
some 450 years ago,

167
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,390
something similar did exist.

168
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:01,980
Back when the capital city, Centoria,
was no more than a tiny village, there were four Gods.

169
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:07,110
I bet they were humans,
the Rath staff who built this world, right?

170
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,910
It's as you say.

171
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,950
Four people from the outside world
descended upon this land,

172
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,750
and raised eight "children" each on two farms.

173
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,910
From reading and writing,

174
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,790
and how to raise crops,

175
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,750
from how to raise livestock...

176
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,220
Until they arrived at what would become the basis
for the Taboo Index, the ethics of morality.

177
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:31,680
From the way the "Original Four" fulfilled
the difficult mission they were given splendidly,

178
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,810
it's obvious that as humans,
they had intelligence of the highest order.

179
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,140
But...

180
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:42,360
There was just one among them who,
though highly intelligent, was unethical.

181
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:48,740
And the children of this person inherited selfish desires,
such as the thirst to possess and rule.

182
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,570
And it was those children
who became the ancestors.

183
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,950
Of the nobles, and of the high ministers
of the Axiom Church.

184
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,710
And reigning over them all
is a single woman, the pontifex of the Axiom Church,

185
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,630
who is now the system supervisor as well.

186
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,340
She calls herself "Administrator,"
the most arrogant name imaginable.

187
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,300
That name...

188
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,810
The Integrity Knight Eldrie said that name, too.

189
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:21,440
I think he said something like,
"I was summoned by the pontifex Administrator."

190
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,020
That's exactly who I've been talking about.

191
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:31,660
And though it's disgusting,
this Administrator is my elder twin sister, so to speak.

192
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,620
Wh-What do you mean by that?

193
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,490
I'll tell you the story in order.

194
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,870
Several decades after the "Original Four"'
had logged out,

195
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:44,130
the first political marriage
between two families of lords was orchestrated,

196
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,130
and a baby girl was born from that union.

197
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,220
Her name was Quinella.

198
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,220
My daughter, Quinella.

199
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,430
I grant you the Calling, "sacred arts research."

200
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,400
I gratefully accept, Father.

201
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,070
System Call.

202
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,530
No one else realizes it,
but sacred words each have their own meaning.

203
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,660
"Call" means to summon.

204
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,790
"Generate" means to produce.

205
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,330
Over here!

206
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,140
System Call. Generate Thermal Element.

207
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,930
Form Element, Arrow Shape. Fly Straight.

208
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,180
Discharge!

209
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:04,250
Lady Quinella, I beg you to heal his legs!

210
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,620
Very well.

211
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,090
System Call. Generate Luminous Element.

212
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,220
Form Element, Liquid Shape.

213
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,140
She's a child of God!

214
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,850
Surely, Lady Quinella
is the holy child of the god Stacia!

215
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,940
Lady Quinella!

216
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,320
<i>Even as a gentle smile was on her face,</i>

217
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:37,320
<i>Quinella knew that the time had come
for her to fully sate her endless thirst to rule.</i>

218
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,000
Soon, we will have a place to pray to the gods.

219
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:58,890
<i>In order to rule over the ever-growing masses,
I will need a written law.</i>

220
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:03,430
<i>First, to ensure that no one with a higher
authority level than mine will ever appear,</i>

221
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,480
<i>I must make hunting taboo.</i>

222
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,650
<i>As well as murder.</i>

223
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,450
Lady Quinella, you wanted to see me?

224
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:21,120
This is a holy book,
a compilation of the god Stacia's oracle.

225
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,450
It is called the Taboo Index.

226
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:29,170
Replicate it, distribute it to every town and village,
and have the people obey it.

227
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,000
Yes, ma'am.

228
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,620
System Call.

229
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,830
Open List.

230
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,830
System Call.

231
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,330
Read List.

232
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,220
System Call.

233
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,480
Inspect List.

234
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,570
<i>And then, Quinella opened it at last.</i>

235
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,320
<i>The Forbidden Door, that is.</i>

236
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,910
Either by way of an impossible coincidence,

237
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,830
or perhaps with a little help
from someone from the outside world...

238
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,830
Let me show you.

239
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,500
System Call!

240
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,500
Inspect Entire Command List!

241
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,760
This is...

242
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:04,720
Yes. Displayed in this window
is the entire catalogue of system commands.

243
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,940
<i>Quinella's first action was to completely
restore her life, and halt its natural decline.</i>

244
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,810
<i>And then restore her looks.</i>

245
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:20,990
<i>She regained the dazzling beauty
of her late teens.</i>

246
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,040
<i>She should've been satisfied at that point.</i>

247
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,910
<i>But...</i>

248
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,040
<i>For Quinella, there could be no one else
who had authority equal to hers...</i>

249
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:39,210
She couldn't even tolerate the existence
of the Cardinal System.

250
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,930
Plotting to seize
the Cardinal System's authority level,

251
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,800
she composed a lengthy sacred art command
and recited it.

252
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,100
<i>As a result...</i>

253
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,850
<i>She burned the fundamental command
assigned to the Cardinal System</i>

254
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:59,570
<i>onto her own Fluctlight
as a non-editable behavioral principle.</i>

255
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:06,780
<i>Her intent was to steal its authority level,
but she ended up fusing her soul with the Cardinal System.</i>

256
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,490
Preservation of Order.

257
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,910
That is the basic command of the Cardinal System,
and reason of existing.

258
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:18,750
As someone who spent time in a world controlled
by the same system, you should understand.

259
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,260
Constantly observing
the actions of you, "the players,"

260
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:28,100
and deal with anything that skews the balance
as soon as its detected, mercilessly.

261
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:38,520
<i>Quinella had lost consciousness,
and awakened after she slept for an entire day.</i>

262
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:43,570
<i>By that time, she'd ceased to be human
in any sense of the word.</i>

263
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:47,320
<i>No longer aging,
drinking no water, eating no bread...</i>

264
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:53,080
<i>Her only desire was to preserve this human realm
that she ruled, as it currently was, forever.</i>

265
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,290
I am both ruler and supervisor...

266
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,550
As of today, I am the pontifex of the Axiom Church...

267
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,010
I am Administrator.

268
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,230
Next time: Ruler and Mediator.
