1
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:13,360
July 18, year 372 in the time
of the realm of humanity

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,120
Forty-seven!

3
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,380
Fifty!

4
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,030
I only heard three good hits out of fifty.

5
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,660
Let's see, that brings it to 41 total, huh?

6
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,330
Looks like you're treating me
to the siral water today, Eugeo.

7
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,370
Says the guy who's only at 43 good hits.

8
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,680
I'll catch up in no time.

9
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,210
Come on, it's your turn...

10
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,410
Kirito.

11
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,880
Yeah, yeah.

12
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,710
One year and three months.

13
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,760
After swinging that ax this much every day...

14
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,600
I can't take much more of this.

15
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,060
There's no point complaining.

16
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,110
After all, it's our Calling
to cut down the Gigas Cedar.

17
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,990
Sure, I know that, but there's no sense
of accomplishment in this job.

18
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,080
Let's see. How much was its life before this?

19
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,170
Something like 235,590.

20
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,880
A measly 50!

21
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,260
After toiling away for two months,
just a measly 50 out of 235,000-something?

22
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,220
We could keep going forever
and never cut it down!

23
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,930
Well, it is a tree that's renowned
for its steel-like durability.

24
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:06,310
The six generations of carvers before us
worked on it for 300 years.

25
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,020
So it should take another 18 generations...
about 900 years.

26
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,940
Listen, you...

27
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,660
Ouch.

28
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,490
Why are you such a goody-goody?

29
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,450
Figure out how to deal
with this unfair role of ours instead!

30
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,970
Wh-What are you doing?

31
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,670
D-Darn you!

32
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,710
Let's see how you like it!

33
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,130
Why, youâ€”

34
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,610
All right, do you give up?

35
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,300
Now you've done it!

36
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,220
Take that!

37
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,140
Payback time!

38
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,720
- Cut it out, Kirito!
- How about here!

39
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,020
Hey! I caught you slacking off again,
didn't I?

40
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,310
Crap.

41
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,400
H-Hey, Alice.

42
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,450
Y-You're done with your sacred arts class?

43
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,410
I mean, you're pretty early today.

44
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,530
I'm not early at all.

45
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,080
It's the same time as always.

46
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,330
Since you have enough energy to wrestle,

47
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,710
maybe I should tell Old Man Garitta
to increase your cutting quota?

48
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,540
N-No, anything but that!

49
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,130
I'm only kidding.

50
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,470
Now then...

51
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,600
...let's have lunch.

52
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,810
It's hot today...

53
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,020
...so eat fast before it all spoils, okay?

54
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,860
- Right!
- Right!

55
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,780
The pie sure tastes awesome today!

56
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,740
Your cooking skills are really improving, Alice!

57
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,460
Y-You really think so?
I felt like it was still missing something.

58
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,880
Still... This lunch is so tasty,
I wish we could've taken our time enjoying it.

59
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,340
Why does the heat make it spoil so quickly?

60
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,890
What do you mean, why?

61
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,890
During the winter we can leave
salted raw meat outside and it'll keep for days.

62
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,890
Sure, because it's cold during the winter.

63
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,980
That's right. So if we keep it cold,
our lunch will last longer, even at this time of year.

64
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:25,110
Are you going to use the forbidden
weather-altering arts to make it snow?

65
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,660
An Integrity Knight from the Axiom Church would
show up before you could blink and spirit you away.

66
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,750
Ice.

67
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,460
We could keep our food cold enough
if we had lots of ice.

68
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,470
And then we could enjoy these delicious lunches
for as long as we want!

69
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,680
That's it! Ice!

70
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,680
Let's go search for ice!

71
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,180
Listen, you...

72
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,400
It's summer. Where would we find ice?

73
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,360
I'm sure there isn't even any
in the Centoria market.

74
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,240
Hey...

75
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,540
Do you remember the story
about the hero Bercouli?

76
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,200
Which one?

77
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,500
You know.

78
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,250
"Bercouli and the Northern White Dragon."

79
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:26,380
The hero, Bercouli,
followed the Rul River to the north.

80
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,970
Inside a cave in the End Mountains, he found
a huge white dragon asleep atop a pile of treasure.

81
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:36,270
He took hold of a beautiful sword
in the treasure, but the instant he did...

82
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,730
According to the story, he found giant icicles
hanging just inside the cave, right?

83
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,490
So if we break some off...

84
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,740
Look, you...

85
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,490
That's not a bad idea.

86
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,370
Come on! You do know, don't you?
Under the laws of the village...

87
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:59,000
The village law forbids any child unaccompanied
by an adult from playing in the End Mountains.

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,710
But searching for ice doesn't count as playing.

89
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:07,740
If it means extending the life of our meals,
it will benefit the villagers, won't it?

90
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,970
So this should be interpreted as work.

91
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,010
I agree.

92
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,600
You're absolutely right.

93
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,060
Yeah, but going to the End Mountains
isn't just against village law,

94
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,980
it's forbidden by "that," right?

95
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,100
"That"?

96
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,750
You know what I mean.

97
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,320
The Taboo Index, of course.

98
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,610
We can't just violate the Taboo Index, can we?

99
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,790
Eugeo, this is what it says in the Index.

100
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,910
Taboo Index, Book One,
Chapter Three, Verse Eleven.

101
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,880
"Thou shalt not cross the End Mountains
that encircle the Human Empire."

102
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:48,590
By "cross," it means entering the Dark Territory
on the other side of the End Mountains.

103
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,010
That doesn't include entering the cave.

104
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,100
But...

105
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,310
Ouch!

106
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,980
All right, it's settled! Our next day off
will be spent looking for the white dragon...

107
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,070
no, I mean the ice cave!

108
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,770
Yeah!

109
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,770
Okay, then we'll meet at the North Gate at 7:00 AM.

110
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,990
Right! And don't oversleep!

111
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,990
Right back at you!

112
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,280
July 21, year 372 in the time
of the realm of humanity

113
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:21,710
Jeez. Making us carry everything...

114
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,170
Well, you shouldn't complain.

115
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:27,340
I mean, we might not get to go out with Alice
like this much longer.

116
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,880
Since Alice is the daughter of the village elder,

117
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,510
I'm sure she'll get even more tied up
with her studies.

118
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,180
Well, the reason
she hasn't been given a Calling

119
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,560
is so she can study
how to hone her sacred arts skills.

120
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,810
And she might be forbidden
from playing with boys too,

121
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,730
to act as a role model
for the other villagers.

122
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,730
Hey!

123
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,200
What are you two whispering about?

124
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,410
U-Uh, nothing! Right?

125
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,440
Yeah.

126
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,080
We were just saying, we have to head back
to the village before the evening bell.

127
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,160
Oh?

128
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,540
That's true.

129
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,130
Then let's turn back
when Solus reaches the middle of the sky.

130
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,010
Now that that's settled, let's hurry!

131
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,060
By the way, did you know?

132
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,190
When this village was first founded,

133
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:30,360
occasionally evil spirits like goblins or orcs
would come from beyond the mountains,

134
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,610
and steal sheep or spirit away children!

135
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,370
What? Are you trying to scare me?

136
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,700
I know about that.

137
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:42,200
In the end, the Integrity Knights came from Centoria
and drove them away, right?

138
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,080
Ever since then, on sunny days,

139
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,170
you can see a Silver Dragon Knight
soaring far above the End Mountains!

140
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,100
There's no way... right?

141
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,000
A cave...

142
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,250
Is this the cave in the End Mountains?

143
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,800
Well, we have no choice but to go in now, right?

144
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,130
System Call.

145
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,350
Generate Luminous Element.

146
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,350
Adhere!

147
00:09:55,030 --> 00:10:00,780
Hey, didn't you say that
the icicles were hanging just inside the cave?

148
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,330
Did I say that?

149
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,580
You did!

150
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,670
Eugeo?

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,920
Bring the light a little closer.

152
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,930
See? You saw that, didn't you?

153
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,190
Seriously? No wonder it feels colder now.

154
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:32,230
It's summer outside,
but it's winter inside this cave.

155
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,360
I'm sure there's ice, too!

156
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,650
Yeah. Let's go a little farther in.

157
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,620
Hey, what are we going to do
if we really come across a white dragon?

158
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,410
We'll have to run, of course.

159
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:49,540
Don't worry. The white dragon won't mind
if we just take some icicles.

160
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,550
But it would be great
to grab at least one scale...

161
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,260
Hey, what are you thinking?

162
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,760
Because if we can bring home proof
that we saw a real dragon...

163
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,640
Hey, it's ice!

164
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,230
There's ice! There's ice here!

165
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,360
I bet there's more up ahead!

166
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,820
That's...

167
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,270
This much ice should be enough
to keep all the food in the village cold.

168
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,480
Are you kidding?

169
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,190
We could make it winter
in the village for a while!

170
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,150
- Hey, don't stop all of a sudden!
- What is this?

171
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,150
Just what is...

172
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,780
...this?

173
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,870
The bones of the white dragon?

174
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,460
It died?

175
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,880
Hey...

176
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,380
This is all scratched up.

177
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,840
And the tip's been cut off cleanly.

178
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,880
Was it fighting with something?

179
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,600
But what living creature could kill a dragon?

180
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,970
These are blade marks.

181
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,440
This dragon was killed by a human.

182
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,440
B-But...

183
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:41,860
...even the hero Bercouli
only managed to get away.

184
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,450
An Integrity Knight?

185
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:49,830
Don't tell me that an Integrity Knight
from the Axiom Church

186
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,120
killed a white dragon,
a protector of the realm of humanity?

187
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,290
I don't know.

188
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,920
There might be really powerful knights
in the Dark Territory, too.

189
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:05,680
But if there are, then the forces of darkness
could just cross over the End Mountains.

190
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,600
What are you doing, Kirito?

191
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,180
This is really heavy!

192
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,010
Could this possibly be...

193
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,900
Yeah. What Bercouli supposedly tried to steal.

194
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,900
It must be the Blue Rose Sword.

195
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,290
No good. It's too heavy.

196
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,830
Even Eugeo and I together couldn't carry it out.

197
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,170
Looks like there are all kinds of treasure, too.

198
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,470
Yeah. But we can't just take them, can we?

199
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,760
That would be like grave robbing.

200
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:55,770
But the White Dragon won't mind
if it's just some ice, right?

201
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,350
So pretty!

202
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,440
What a waste,
bringing it back just to have it melt.

203
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,780
But if it means our meals will last longer,
what does it matter?

204
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,030
You mean everybody's meals, right?

205
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:12,240
We'd better get going,
or we won't make it back by evening.

206
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,830
You're right.

207
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,750
Hey...

208
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,750
which way did we come in from?

209
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,010
We've been walking a long time now.

210
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,180
Do you think maybe
we came from the opposite direction?

211
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,390
You're the one who picked this path
because you thought it was closer.

212
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,850
Did you say something?

213
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,400
No, nothing!

214
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,490
Is that the wind?

215
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,800
We're almost outside!

216
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,850
We picked the right path!

217
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,250
Hey! You'll fall if you run in a place like this!

218
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,760
There's the exit!

219
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,480
This is...

220
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,110
...the Dark Territory.

221
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,280
We can't go any farther.

222
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,590
Dragon Knights...

223
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,590
The white one...

224
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,390
Is that an Axiom Church Integrity Knight?

225
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,800
So the black one's from the forces of darkness?

226
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,330
No!

227
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,420
Alice!

228
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,190
<i>Taboo Index, Book One,

00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:31,610

230
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,740
Alice!

231
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,740
I-I...

232
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,950
I-It's all right, Alice.

233
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:46,120
It's not like you left the cave.
Right? Isn't that right, Kirito?

234
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,080
Kirito?

235
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,430
What's that?

236
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,090

<i>Report complete.</i>

240
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,060
It's gone?

241
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,320
What was that just now?

242
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,730
I don't know.

243
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,190
Let's just head back!

244
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,510
All right, let's go home.

245
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,470
Right.

246
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,260
Okay, I'm going to go put this
in the basement.

247
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,260
Okay.

248
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,350
See you.

249
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,020
Look forward to tomorrow's lunch, okay?

250
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,480
Sure!

251
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,860
S-Sure.

252
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,180
Alice...

253
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,350
Don't go! Alice!

254
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,610
Alice!

255
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,970
Hey, Kirito!

256
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,100
Yeah. It's the Integrity Knight from yesterday.

257
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,690
No way! Alice...

258
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,480
It can't be.

259
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,320
Just for something like that?

260
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,280
Let's go!

261
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,740
Hey!

262
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,340
Alice!

263
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,560
Kirito! Eugeo!

264
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,640
Quiet.

265
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,140
You'd better get away while you can.

266
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,320
Father!

267
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,700
I serve as the village elder.
My name is Zuberg.

268
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,250
I am the Axiom Church Integrity Knight
overseeing northern Norlangarth,

269
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,880
Deusolbert Synthesis Seven.

270
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:25,340
For her crimes against the Taboo Index,
the child of Gasfut Zuberg, Alice Zuberg,

271
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,890
will now be apprehended, taken in,
and, after questioning, executed.

272
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:37,020
The charge is Taboo Index, Book One,
Chapter Three, Verse Eleven,

273
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,230
trespassing into the Dark Territory.

274
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,800
Sir Knight!

275
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,470
A-Alice never went into the Dark Territory!

276
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:11,140
She just touched the ground with one hand
for a second!

277
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,310
That's all she did!

278
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,810
What more do you think she had to do?

279
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,040
Th-Then we're just as guilty as she is!

280
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,150
We were there in that same place!

281
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,980
If you're taking her, then take us, too!

282
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,660
Eugeo... listen.

283
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,950
I'm going to swing the ax at him.

284
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,240
You grab Alice then and run!

285
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,210
K-Kirito... but that's...

286
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,140
Who cares about taboos?

287
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,920
Are you saying they're more important
than Alice's life?

288
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,730
Kirito!

289
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,490
Escort those two kids from the square.

290
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,110
Dammit!

291
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,920
Eugeo, please! Go after her!

292
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,650
Eugeo! At least get these guys off me! Then I'll...

293
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,770
Eugeo!

294
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,800
Alice!

295
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:40,000
Underworld

296
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,790
Saturday, June 27, 2026

297
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,890
This is a fully-automatic Tanegashima!

298
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:47,810
You dirty PK jerks, how do you like this?

299
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,040
Damn!

300
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,750
You're up! I'll cover you!

301
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,620
Photon Swords?

302
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,290
Teams B and C,
head to Grid 4-6 to back up Team A.

303
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,750
You have permission to use grenades.

304
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,540
Hey, Boss, can I go too?

305
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,500
It's probably too late for that.

306
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,710
Just sit back and watch.

307
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,650
Leave this to me!

308
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,930
Again?

309
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,850
Time's up, huh?

310
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,400
All teams, retreat.

311
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,110
Move away from Grid 1-9.

312
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:01,410
That would've been
the last prey for today, right?

313
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,740
You sure you want to end on a loss, Boss?

314
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,710
Battling an irregular squadron like that
won't do much good, training-wise.

315
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,670
We wouldn't want any negative effects
to carry over into the actual operation.

316
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:14,920
Let's go.

317
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,090
Till next time.

318
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:32,350
Man, I'd heard the rumors,
but GGO sure is a hardcore game.

319
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,480
I mean, you're allowed to PK all you want
wherever you are on the field!

320
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:42,280
Yeah, but even with no-holds-barred PK-ing,
that squadron we just fought was an anomaly.

321
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,160
Normally, you'd PK for money or items...

322
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,500
But those guys only seemed to be
focused on killing us.

323
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,870
They were tossing grenades and smoke
without restraint.

324
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,830
Wouldn't that put them in the red?

325
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:59,280
Probably. But they're always like that
whenever they show up.

326
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,220
They attack squadrons that are left isolated
on the field, massacre them,

327
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,090
then vanish without even looting items.

328
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:09,640
Is it true they have a 100% win rate?

329
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,600
As far as I know, yes.

330
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:12,690
So...

331
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,060
I thought we could win
if we went after them in a really unusual style.

332
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,400
That's why I asked you all for your help.

333
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,930
Sorry. My plan had too many holes.

334
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,610
I never thought they'd just retreat like that!

335
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:28,080
But hey, it's not a defeat, right?

336
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,540
Nah, they're the ones who ran,
so it's the same as a win!

337
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:36,380
Not that we have any idea who they really are,
or what they're after.

338
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,040
Well, that's just... um...

339
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:43,550
I wish we could've
at least found out their leader's name.

340
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:47,850
It wasn't even clear which one of them
was the leader, though, was it?

341
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,100
Hey! Don't crash out like that!

342
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,600
He said he's been taking time off from school
since Thursday, touring companies.

343
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,570
He's probably tangled up
in some bizarre business again, huh?

344
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,700
You guys, thank you so much
for helping me out.

345
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,370
Hey, no biggie!

346
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:09,870
Later!

347
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,570
I had fun!

348
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,950
See you!

349
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,000
All right, I'm off, too.

350
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,580
Um... Asuna.

351
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,330
What is it?

352
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,840
There's actually something I need your help with.

353
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,090
You mean with the PK squadron?

354
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,920
Actually, it's something else.

355
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,470
Could you and Kirito meet with me
on the other side tomorrow?

356
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,510
Coming at the end of 2026

357
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,730
Let's see... the evening should be okay.

358
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,350
Is Agil's shop all right with you?

359
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,190
Of course.

360
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:43,070
Oh, I'll email you the gist of what
I'm going to ask you. Read it over, okay?

361
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,400
Roger that!

362
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,580
Saturday, June 28, 2026

363
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,990
Hey, did you lose more weight?

364
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,620
You think so?

365
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,210
Never mind that.

366
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:00,040
Didn't you want to ask me something?

367
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,670
Is it about BoB?

368
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,120
Yeah.

369
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,510
There's a player named Subtilizer
who won BoB IV.

370
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:11,100
He also won the very first one.

371
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,430
We were all so fired up, you know.

372
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:17,810
About getting the chance
to face the legendary Subtilizer.

373
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:23,110
From what I could tell from the live feed,
he's got a silent, matter-of-fact fighting style.

374
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:27,280
It seemed similar to the vibe I was getting
from yesterday's PK squadron.

375
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,660
Hey, now that you mention it, it is.

376
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,990
The only difference is that
Subtilizer's on a whole other level.

377
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,620
It was the same with me, too, but...

378
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:42,750
He read my every move,
and forced me into extreme close combat.

379
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,090
I was killed
before I could even aim my gun.

380
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,760
That's incredible.

381
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:51,050
To be able to anticipate the moves
of BoB veterans.

382
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,600
After playing enough to be considered a veteran,
you find yourself bound by theory,

383
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,390
so it might be easy to recognize patterns
in our movements.

384
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,190
Which brings me to my request.

385
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:09,810
The way I see it, a player who acts totally off-script
might be able to outmaneuver Subtilizer.

386
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:14,280
It may be a little early, but I'd like your help
in the fifth one at the end of the year.

387
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,620
That's why I've asked you here today.

388
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,160
Huh?

389
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,040
Whoever we're up against,
we're definitely going to win the next one!

390
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,790
Whatever it takes!

391
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,250
Looks like you're pretty much over it now.

392
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:33,550
It isn't like I'm not scared at all,
but I'm getting better.

393
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:37,390
By the way, how's he doing?

394
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,640
Shinkawa is...

395
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,850
Yeah, his condition's starting to stabilize.

396
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,690
I'm planning to visit him again soon.

397
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,030
I see.

398
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,570
Then that means the Death Gun incident
is wrapped up now, huh?

399
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:58,290
Although there's still one perp on the run.

400
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,730
Kikuoka said it's just a matter of time
before he's arrested, too.

401
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,080
Yeah. I guess so.

402
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,670
Hello!

403
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,170
Hey, there, Shino-non!

404
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,880
A-Asuna!

405
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,880
Hello, Asuna!

406
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,930
About BoB V, it's okay with me!

407
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:19,100
You asked Asuna, too?

408
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,310
Yes. I was a little nervous that
you'd spin out of control on your own,

409
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,860
so partly to serve as your limiter...

410
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,730
Hey, Kirito.

411
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,400
You've lost weight, haven't you?

412
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,530
You think so?

413
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,870
You see? Even Asuna thinks so!

414
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:38,990
It's because of your part-time job, isn't it?

415
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,660
Really. Overdoing it again.

416
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,830
It doesn't seem to be
affecting you physically, but...

417
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,670
What are you looking at?

418
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,460
What's this?

419
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,420
Don't stare at it like that.

420
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,970
Hold on, is this Kirito's...

421
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,340
You guessed right!

422
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:00,390
B-But how does that work?

423
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:05,310
I have a miniature sensor implanted right here.

424
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:10,110
It sends information more or less in real time
over the internet to Asuna's smartphone.

425
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,990
Wh-Wh-Why would you...

426
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,160
It wouldn't be an anti-cheating system,
would it?

427
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,660
- No, no!
- It's not!

428
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:22,450
They recommended it to me
when I started at my current part-time job.

429
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:27,120
Because it would be a hassle
to stick electrodes on me every time.

430
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:31,750
And when I told Asuna about it,
she started using it for this.

431
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:35,050
Well, looking at it
really sets my mind at ease.

432
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:38,590
To see that Kirito's heart is beating.

433
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,810
It makes me trip a little, you know!

434
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,390
That doesn't sound very good, Asuna.

435
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:49,520
Anyway, having you on my side
gives me an edge.

436
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,310
It's like having a heavy machine gun
in a pillbox!

437
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,780
You won't be sorry you picked me!

438
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,740
Now, then...

439
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,700
Let's hear about your sketchy new job.

440
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,460
Though I'm sure it's as an alpha tester
for some new VRMMO game.

441
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,540
What I'm testing isn't a game app.

442
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:14,880
It's a brain-machine interface
for a new full-dive system.

443
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,170
It's being developed by Rath.

444
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:20,640
I've never heard of that company.

445
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,220
That's the name of an imaginary creature
that appears in <i>Through the Looking-Glass</i>.

446
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,060
Some say it's a pig,
while others say it's a turtle.

447
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,940
So they're going to release
a next-generation full-dive machine?

448
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,700
I don't know about that.

449
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,160
In the first place, it's completely different
from the current full-dive tech.

450
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:43,870
Different? What's the in-game world like?

451
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,080
I don't actually know.

452
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:50,830
I'm sure it's for the sake of confidentiality,

453
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:54,460
but any of the memories
the machine creates in this VR world,

454
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,710
I can't bring back to the real world.

455
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:00,260
Whatever I saw during the tests,
whatever I did,

456
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:03,050
I've forgotten every last detail.

457
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,770
Forgotten every last detail?

458
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:10,190
Don't tell me it's the same as the Augma?

459
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,070
Uh... no, it's not!

460
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:17,210
It doesn't put any stress on your brain
like the Augma did.

461
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:21,610
It's just that I can't remember,
since the Fluctlight is blocking the path.

462
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:24,080
Fluct...?

463
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,620
Should I explain the general concept?

464
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:33,040
About this machine...
the Soul Translator technology?

465
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,670
Where do you think the human soul is located?

466
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,760
Soul?

467
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,010
In your head... the brain, right?

468
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,260
The brain is more or less
a clump of brain cells, right?

469
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:49,310
So where among the brain cells
does the soul exist?

470
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:55,650
All cells, including brain cells,
are supported by a structural network.

471
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:58,230
Apparently, they're called microtubules.

472
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,440
Tubes. In other words, hollow pipes.

473
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,870
And there's something
sealed inside those hollow pipes.

474
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,580
What's inside them?

475
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,290
Light.

476
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,000
Light. A fluctuating light photon.

477
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,840
And that's what comprises the human soul,
according to Rath.

478
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:24,220
You mean that cluster of light is the human soul?

479
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:31,480
And at Rath, this thing that might be
the human soul is known as...

480
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,690
The Fluctlight.

481
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:40,650
So the machine that reads Fluctlights
is called the Soul Translator?

482
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,770
But you could do the opposite as well, right?

483
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:44,860
Opposite?

484
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:49,240
The Amusphere allows us
to experience the virtual world

485
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,410
by sending visual and audio signals
to the brain, right?

486
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,090
So couldn't the Soul Translator send information
to the soul in the same way?

487
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,170
Yeah, that's right.

488
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,420
The Soul Translator,

489
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:07,140
or STL, writes short-term memories
onto the Fluctlight to insert information

490
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,390
of the sights or sounds
it wants us to experience.

491
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,100
Apparently, it's called mnemonic visual data.

492
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:18,310
I have memories of my test dives
at the very beginning,

493
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,690
but it was different.

494
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,190
It was completely different.

495
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,240
Nothing like the VR world
created by the Amusphere.

496
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:31,870
At first, I couldn't even tell it was a virtual world.

497
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:34,710
But is it really safe?

498
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,000
It scares me.

499
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,920
It was Mr. Kikuoka of the Ministry of Internal Affairs
who offered you that job, wasn't it?

500
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:48,010
It's true that I have to be on my guard
around that guy.

501
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,600
But I want to know.

502
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:55,560
Where full-dive technology is headed.

503
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,440
I have a feeling.

504
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,360
There's something about the STL.

505
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:05,030
I mean, sure, terms like "Fluctlights"
and "mnemonic visual" sound complicated.

506
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:10,070
But the world created by the STL
is like a realistic dream.

507
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:10,990
A dream?

508
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:14,450
For example,
you have long dreams sometimes, right?

509
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:19,830
And when you wake up, it feels like
you've been dreaming for two or three hours.

510
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:24,670
But chances are, you've actually
only been dreaming for a few minutes.

511
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:28,510
The STL creates the same kind of phenomenon.

512
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,300
Um...

513
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,430
The same way that humans see dreams
spanning several hours in a matter of minutes,

514
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:38,850
you can also experience the virtual world
several times longer than the actual dive time.

515
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,770
That's the STL's featured function.

516
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:45,030
Fluctlight Acceleration.

517
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,490
FLA for short.

518
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,410
I'm so confused.

519
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:58,000
So during the three days you were diving,
about how much time did you spend inside?

520
00:39:58,370 --> 00:39:59,370
I'm not sure.

521
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,090
I don't remember
whether it was ten days or a month.

522
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,300
The only thing they told me was the code name
of the experimental virtual world.

523
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,220
What's it called?

524
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,600
The Underworld.

525
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,100
Under... an underground world?

526
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,850
You know, that could be from Alice too.

527
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:25,690
See, that was what the manuscript version
of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> was called.

528
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:30,110
The original title was
<i>Alice's Adventures Under Ground</i>.

529
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,620
Is something wrong?

530
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:38,080
Well, when I heard the name Alice,
it felt like a memory was about to surface.

531
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,210
Does that mean...

532
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,540
It's like...

533
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:46,880
It's like there's something
I need to do right away.

534
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,140
We'll be back soon, Agil!

535
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:53,930
Right.

536
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,830
Okay, I'll be in touch again about BoB.

537
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,610
Thanks for coming today.

538
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,820
Sure! See you, Shino-non!

539
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,980
Later, Asuna.

540
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:11,610
Let's go.

541
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:14,660
What's wrong?

542
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,830
N-Nothing. Let's go.

543
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,300
Kirito?

544
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,600
Asuna.

545
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:45,350
I'm thinking of going after all.

546
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,480
America?

547
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,060
Yeah.

548
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:51,780
The next generation full-dive tech research
is more advanced over there.

549
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,490
I have to see it.

550
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,160
The moment the next world is created.

551
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,750
It wasn't all just fun and games.

552
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:05,210
There was so much pain and sadness, too,
wasn't there?

553
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:09,800
Of course you want to find out
why that castle summoned you,

554
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,370
and where it all leads.

555
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:15,890
Not even living several centuries
would be long enough to find that out.

556
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,350
So...

557
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,560
I-I want...

558
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:24,020
I want you to come with me, Asuna.

559
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,190
I know that's asking a lot.

560
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,980
But even still, I...

561
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,570
I can't live without you!

562
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,620
Of course I'll go. With you.

563
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,250
I'll go wherever you go. No matter where!

564
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,040
Asuna...

565
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:03,140
But don't you want to research
the Soul Translator?

566
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:06,440
It's a next-generation interface, too, right?

567
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:10,400
I'm not sure about that.

568
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,070
I have a feeling it's not just a machine
that enables people to full-dive into virtual worlds.

569
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,780
Then what is it?

570
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:20,990
It might be a machine for learning more
about Fluctlights... about human consciousness.

571
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,250
And also...

572
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:30,290
I think the STL is an extension of his...
of Heathcliff's philosophy.

573
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,040
The commander's?

574
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:39,010
Why that guy used the NerveGear
and SAO to cause thousands of casualties,

575
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:41,180
why he burned out his own brain,

576
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:45,220
and on top of that scattered something
like the Seed all over the place...

577
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,650
I guess I do want to find out,
but I don't want that to be my career path.

578
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:54,900
Because that would feel like
he was still manipulating me.

579
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,800
Didn't you have a talk
with the commander's consciousness?

580
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,700
Yeah.

581
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,700
I have a feeling that the reason
he left a copy of himself behind

582
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:08,210
has something to do with what
Rath is trying to accomplish with the STL.

583
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,840
Excuse me!

584
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:16,050
Um, which way is the station?

585
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,840
Let's see...

586
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,890
Kirito?

587
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,140
You were skulking around the Dicey Cafe,
weren't you?

588
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:28,020
I guess an ambush isn't going to work.

589
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,390
Who are you?

590
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:32,770
Hey now, don't be like that, Kirito.

591
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,480
Oh wait, I always had a mask on
over there, didn't I?

592
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:42,990
Now that XaXa's been caught,
I have to show some grit, right?

593
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,330
As the last survivor of Laughing Coffin!

594
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:50,460
<i>Johnny Black!</i>

595
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:00,510
Nope! No sword there!

596
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:03,220
So you're still on the run?

597
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,300
Of course!

598
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,310
But really, Kirito...

599
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:11,350
Without your sword,
you're nothing but a feeble little brat, huh?

600
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:16,730
I can't believe you're the same swordsman
who beat the crap out of me!

601
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:18,220
What about you?

602
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,030
You don't have your poisoned weapon of choice.

603
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:22,240
Oh, I have it!

604
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,950
I have a poison weapon, all right!

605
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,660
<i>Death Gun!</i>

606
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,250
Asuna! Run!

607
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,530
Kirito!

608
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,870
Next time: The Demon Tree.
