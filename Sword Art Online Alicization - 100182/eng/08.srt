1
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,960
Kirito.

2
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,920
Liena-senpai.

3
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,710
Kirito, I believe in your strength.

4
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,760
Since I believe in your strength,
I'll teach you something.

5
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,430
There's a family rule
hidden within Volo's Levantein family.

6
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,350
"Soak this sword in the blood of the mighty."

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,150
"Doing so will make their power your own."

8
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,520
Did you say blood?

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,450
Yes. Volo's been engaging in these one-point duels
with real swords even before he started here.

10
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,370
Those experiences allow him to produce
his mighty sword.

11
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,080
<i>I see. The power of his imagination, huh?</i>

12
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,750
<i>"You become stronger by absorbing
the blood of powerful enemies."</i>

13
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,300
<i>This Levantein family rule
is imbuing Volo's sword with power.</i>

14
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:18,680
He's planning to convert your sword strength
into blood, absorb it, and feed on it.

15
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,980
However, let me say it again. I believe in you.

16
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,730
You're not the kind of swordsman
who'd fall so easily to that man.

17
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,690
You haven't forgotten
what you promised me yesterday, have you?

18
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,570
Promise...

19
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,620
That's right.
I promised to show you everything I have.

20
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,330
Then show it to me now, Kirito!

21
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,670
Right. I'll fulfill my promise to you now.

22
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,920
Are you ready yet, Trainee Kirito?

23
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,680
Yes.

24
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:05,100
Elite Disciple Serlut,
will you serve as our witness?

25
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,770
Very well.

26
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:16,940
The one-point match between Elite Disciple Levantein
and Novice Trainee Kirito will now begin.

27
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:24,330
As has been mutually agreed,
both will use real swords.

28
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,330
Real swords?

29
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,970
Swordsman's Pride

30
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:34,370
Well, well! Is it customary to dye swords black
in the hinterlands, Lord Raios?

31
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,920
Don't be like that, Humbert.

32
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,880
Those pages must be too busy
to polish their swords, that's all.

33
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,450
The High-Norkian Style,
Heavenly Mountain-Splitting Wave stance.

34
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,410
So he's starting off with his secret skill?

35
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,290
<i>That's the two-handed,
heavy one-hit thrust skill, Avalanche.</i>

36
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,540
<i>And not just any Avalanche, either.</i>

37
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,090
<i>His power of imagination
should be amplifying its force.</i>

38
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,340
<i>But I can't afford to dodge it.</i>

39
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:31,390
<i>If I'm going to keep my promise to Liena-senpai,
I have to block his strike!</i>

40
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:37,770
<i>I'll counter with a greater amount of strikes
with a four-hit strike, Vertical Square!</i>

41
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,720
He stopped it!

42
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:20,860
<i>If I can endure this one,
Iâ€™ll still have my fourth hit!</i>

43
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,990
<i>Is this what Volo's shouldering?
The Levantein family's...</i>

44
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,790
<i>Is this the source of his power,
the strength of his imagination?</i>

45
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,800
<i>But I also...</i>

46
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,180
<i>I also...</i>

47
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,690
I also can't afford to lose here!

48
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,660
<i>Did his sword just grow?</i>

49
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,440
That's enough!

50
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,410
M-Ms. Azurica?

51
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,250
We have no choice
but to obey any ruling of hers.

52
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,380
Uh... why is that?

53
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,880
Because seven years ago,
during the Four Empire Unification Tournament,

54
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,760
she was the first swordsman
to represent the North's Norlangarth Empire.

55
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,140
The punishment for Trainee Kirito
is hereby concluded!

56
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:25,770
From now on, be careful
not to fling mud onto anyone.

57
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,960
<i>It went back to its normal size.</i>

58
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,050
I thought you had gotten slashed.

59
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,930
Yes. I thought that, too.

60
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,560
And yet you refused to surrender.
You hopeless idiot.

61
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,650
That was a magnificent, spectacular fight, Kirito.

62
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,570
I'm truly grateful.

63
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,240
It's too bad that I couldn't have it all to myself,

64
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,580
but as you promised, you showed me a fight
with you using all of your strength.

65
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,870
Thank you.

66
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,290
O-Oh, but it was a draw.

67
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,840
Achieving a draw against Levantein
is not enough for you?

68
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,340
N-No, that's not what I meant.

69
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,390
It's no longer a matter of winning or losing.

70
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,640
Seeing you in battle taught me something...

71
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,520
something extremely important.

72
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,730
Why don't we have
a light celebration in my room?

73
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,690
Let's invite Eugeo
and Lord Golgorossa, too, shall we?

74
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,150
Right!

75
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,840
It struck me once again today
as I was watching your match.

76
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,090
Your Aincrad Style has endless potential.

77
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:22,260
I used to see my own Serlut Style
as a practical sword skill, but it's still too rigid.

78
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,140
You're not going there again, are you?

79
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,690
I've never once beaten you, Senpai.

80
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:33,190
The diversity of attacks in the Serlut Style
is nothing more than stunning.

81
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,070
Actually, Kirito...

82
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:44,870
Because a distant ancestor of the Serlut family
displeased the emperor,

83
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:50,080
we are forbidden from passing down
our official sword skill, the High-Norkian Style.

84
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:57,380
So we had no choice but to hone our actual
combat skills, rather, our irregular sword skills.

85
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,300
That's the Serlut Style.

86
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,720
It's not that I resent it.

87
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,140
On the contrary,
I've always been proud of our style.

88
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,810
But somewhere in my mind,
I might have had some doubts.

89
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,690
For two years,

90
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:20,110
I think the reason I couldn't defeat Volo
is because he passes down the High-Norkian Style.

91
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,610
Senpai...

92
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,410
But you're different.

93
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,750
Despite also being a wielder of a unique style,

94
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,670
you don't feel inferior compared
to those trained in the traditional styles.

95
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:39,130
Watching you closely for a year,
and seeing you fight against Volo today...

96
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:42,010
I think I finally understand the reason.

97
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:50,980
Being the successor to the Serlut Style
fills me with great pride and also joy.

98
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,690
As well as becoming your mentor, too.

99
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:02,530
Liena-senpai, I'm counting on you to defeat
First-Seat Volo in your final ranking exam match.

100
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,070
Right!

101
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,260
Well, well! Perfect timing.

102
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,850
I was just about to go look for you.

103
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,100
What do you want?

104
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:40,230
Needless to say, I wanted to compliment you
on your dazzling combat style.

105
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,740
Well, those stunt-oriented sword skills of yours

106
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,450
must've unnerved even the first seat,
don't you agree?

107
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,160
Are you picking a fight with me?

108
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,500
Of course not!

109
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,130
A high-ranking nobleman
would never pick anything with a commoner.

110
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,380
Even if we do dole out charity!

111
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:10,310
In honor of your stunt,
no, your valiant battle, I extend you this gift.

112
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,680
Please accept it.

113
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,310
Now then, with that, we shall excuse ourselves.

114
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,440
Good night, Sir Kirito.

115
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,230
Don't let it get to your head!

116
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,970
<i>At first, it was just an experiment.</i>

117
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:59,900
<i>A flower that never blooms
in the Northern Empire, the zephilia.</i>

118
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,190
<i>Liena-senpai said they were her favorite flower.</i>

119
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,950
<i>I wanted to see if I could make them bloom
using the power of my imagination.</i>

120
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,160
<i>But along the way,</i>

121
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:18,210
<i>I'd started identifying with these flowers
that are fighting so hard to bloom in foreign soil.</i>

122
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:24,960
<i>Cut off from the real world,
from those I cared for, from those I loved...</i>

123
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,880
<i>I'd been trying to share
my loneliness and pain with these flowers</i>

124
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,300
<i>of not knowing when I would ever
be reunited with them.</i>

125
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,690
I'm sorry.

126
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,210
<i>Believe in them.</i>

127
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,460
<i>In the strength of these flowers
that have grown this much in foreign soil.</i>

128
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,050
Who're you?

129
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:11,510
<i>As well as your own strength,
who has nurtured them until now.</i>

130
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,270
But they're all dead now.

131
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,190
<i>It'll be all right.</i>

132
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:22,480
<i>The roots in the soil are still trying to live.</i>

133
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,820
<i>Not to mention, you sense it, don't you?</i>

134
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:32,780
<i>The numerous sacred flowers in these planters
want to save their tiny friends.</i>

135
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,040
Impossible.

136
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,750
I can't cast advanced sacred arts like that.

137
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,080
<i>All spells are about "Meaning."</i>

138
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:48,710
<i>They're no more than tools for guiding
and arranging what you call "images."</i>

139
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,130
<i>Now, feel it.</i>

140
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,180
The flowers' prayers.

141
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,640
The laws of the world.

142
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,680
The intent that emerges from the heart.
"Meaning."

143
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:33,180
Please, can you share
just a little bit of your power, your life?

144
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:41,180
<i>Imagine the flowers' life force flowing into
the zephilia's roots, using me as their catalyst.</i>

145
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,470
That voice just now...

146
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:19,930
Thank you.

LEVANTEIN

151
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,100
That's the match!

152
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,620
<i>And so, Liena-senpai</i>

153
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:17,380
<i>graduated the North Centoria Swordcraft Academy
as its top-ranked student.</i>

154
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:25,100
<i>And after our Advancement Exam,
Eugeo and I were ranked seat five and six,</i>

155
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,140
<i>and were promoted to Elite Disciples.</i>

158
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,480
Now reporting to Elite Disciple Eugeo!

159
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,940
I have completed today's cleaning!

160
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,280
Good job, Tiese.

161
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,660
You're free to go back to your dorm room now.

162
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,620
And, um...

163
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,290
Sorry, Ronie.

164
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:55,170
I've told him numerous times to be back
before you're done cleaning the room.

165
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:59,420
Oh, n-no! My duty as a page only ends
when I've made my report!

166
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,640
I can put in a word for you, too, so you could
get your mentor changed to someone else.

167
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,890
If you serve under him,
it's definitely going to be a long year for you.

168
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,600
O-Oh, not at all!

169
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,150
Hey, hey!

170
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,400
What are you talking about
when I'm not around?

171
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,900
Elite Disciple Kirito, allow me to report!

172
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,870
Today's cleaning
has been completed without issues.

173
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,700
Okay, good job.

174
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,450
Listen, Kirito.

175
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:35,040
These two are much busier than you, so try
to get back here before they're done cleaning.

176
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,340
Also, why do you have to come through
the window, anyway?

177
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:43,090
Going through this window is the shortest route
when you're coming from East Third Street.

178
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,720
Ronie and Tiese, if you remember that,
it'll come in handy someday.

179
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,010
Y-Yes!

180
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,520
Don't teach them stuff
they don't need to know.

181
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:55,190
If you went to East Third Street,
that bag must be from...

182
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,940
If you want some, then just say so, Eugeo.

183
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,120
Here. Have these with your roommates
when you get back to your dorm.

184
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,880
Th-Thank you very much, Elite Disciple!

185
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,840
To ensure the life of the goods won't decrease,
we will now return to our dorm at top speed!

186
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,510
See you tomorrow!

187
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,760
I knew it! These are honey pies
from the Prancing Deer Cafe!

188
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,510
Let's hurry back before they get cold!

189
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,310
- Yeah!
- Let's go!

190
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,310
What is it?

191
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,100
Oh, it's nothing, really.

192
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:45,240
I was just wondering if perhaps
Elite Disciple Kirito has forgotten why we're here?

193
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,990
Like I'd forget.

194
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,240
We've finally made it this far.

195
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,420
Yeah.

196
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,590
It won't be long now, huh?

197
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,140
Next time: Nobleman's Responsibilities.
