1
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,960
System Call. Generate Luminous Element.

2
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,550
Amazing... these are all weapons?

3
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,630
Let's go. We have to find our swords.

4
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,550
Here they are!

5
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,240
How long are you going to stand there in awe?

6
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,320
I couldn't help it.

7
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,330
Hey, Kirito.

8
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,950
Do you think the Church is planning
to build its own army someday?

9
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,210
The Integrity Knights alone should be enough.

10
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,790
It's the opposite. They're not building an army.

11
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,670
The Church gathered all these weapons here
to make creating one impossible.

12
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,010
What does that mean?

13
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,930
In other words, I'm saying the person
who has the least faith in the Church's authority

14
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,560
might be the pontifex herself.

15
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,600
Come on, we don't have time.

16
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,730
Let's get out of here.

17
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,560
Uh, yeah. You're right.

18
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,530
What do you think, Kirito?
Should we borrow some armor, too?

19
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,660
Well, we've never worn armor before.

20
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,950
We should stick to what we know.

21
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,950
Let's help ourselves to those clothes over there.

22
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,990
The Crimson Knight

23
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,700
Burst Element!

24
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,590
Straight ahead!

25
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,760
Such absurd antics.

26
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,940
Kirito! You okay?

27
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,860
B-Barely.

28
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,990
I'm okay this time.

29
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,880
Let's go.

30
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,540
System Call.

31
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,970
This is bad. That's not an elemental command.
It's the Perfect Weapon Control art!

32
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,930
Enhance Armament.

33
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:20,210
That's amazing.
I wonder what that bow's source is?

34
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,880
This is no time to be impressed!

35
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,510
It's been two years since I was last engulfed
by the Conflagration Bow.

36
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,470
I see.

37
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,730
You criminals do indeed have the skills
to contend with Sir Eldrie Thirty-one.

38
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,730
But that makes it all the more unforgivable.

39
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,440
That instead of fighting
as a proper knight should,

40
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,070
you resorted to the vile dark arts
to lead Thirty-one astray!

41
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,160
D-Dark arts?

42
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,910
Y-You're wrong! We just talked about Mr. Eldrie's life
before he became an Integrity Knight!

43
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,540
Before he became a Knight?

44
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,330
None of us has a past.

45
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,790
From the moment we were summoned here
from the heavens,

46
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,510
we have always been glorious Integrity Knights!

47
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,930
I've been ordered to capture you alive,
so I won't reduce you to cinders.

48
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:19,230
But now that I've unleashed the Conflagration Bow,
prepare for at least one of your arms to be burned off.

49
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,570
It doesn't matter if he's out of arrows
or his bowstring's broken, huh?

50
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,660
Any ideas?

51
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,830
I have to believe that he can't fire rapidly.

52
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,120
I'll somehow block his first shot,
so you charge in.

53
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,330
Have to believe?

54
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,680
Got it!

55
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,190
System Call! Generate Cryogenic Element!

56
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,530
Discharge!

57
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,740
Ludicrous!

58
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,420
Kirito!

59
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,340
Keep going, Eugeo!

60
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,360
Don't insult me, boy!

61
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,070
<i>What now?</i>

62
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,910
In this world, the important thing
is what you infuse your sword with.

63
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,080
I wonder what I should infuse my sword with?

64
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,040
That's something you need to find on your own.

65
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,050
<i>Right. That's all that matters.</i>

66
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,020
<i>I'm definitely going to rescue Alice this time. So...</i>

67
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,230
<i>Please, Blue Rose Sword!</i>

68
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,100
<i>Lend me your strength!</i>

69
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,320
<i>I have to move forward!</i>

70
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,010
<i>You...</i>

71
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,760
<i>...ever since the world's creation,</i>

72
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,180
<i>were forged by the bitter cold blizzards
at the top of the End Mountains.</i>

73
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,190
Don't let these pathetic flames...

74
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,610
...defeat you!

75
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,050
You're not getting away!

76
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,320
Boy, what's the name
of that first secret skill you used?

77
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,200
The Aincrad-style two-hit strike sword skill,
Vertical Arc.

78
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,740
A two-hit strike attack...

79
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,200
And you?

80
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,830
What skill did you use?

81
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,500
Kirito! Are you hurt?

82
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,830
I'm okay.

83
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,090
I mostly healed the worst burns.

84
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:41,840
Old man knight, that was the Aincrad-style
defensive skill, Spinning Shield.

85
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,100
From one end of the realm of humanity
to the other...

86
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,520
I was sure that I'd seen past that.

87
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:57,610
But in this world, there are still swords I've never seen,
skills I've never encountered, eh?

88
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:05,160
Your skills were suffused
with the weight of years of earnest training.

89
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:14,630
I accused you of using vile arts to lead Sir Eldrie astray,
but I was mistaken.

90
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,840
Please tell me your names.

91
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,090
Eugeo the Swordsman. No family name.

92
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,380
I'm Kirito the Swordsman.

93
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,350
On the fiftieth floor of the cathedral,

94
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:35,480
in the Great Hall of Ghostly Light,
there are several Integrity Knights awaiting you.

95
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:40,650
They've been ordered not to take you alive,
but to extinguish your lives.

96
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,740
If you charge them head-on like you just did,

97
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,160
your lives will be snuffed out in an instant.

98
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,120
H-Hey, old man. Is it okay for you to tell us that?

99
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:58,500
As I've failed to carry out Administrator's order,

100
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,170
I will be stripped of my armor and Divine Object,
the proof of my knighthood,

101
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,140
and will be frozen indefinitely.

102
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,270
So before I submit to such shame,
I want you two...

103
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,350
...to take my life.

104
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,110
No need to hesitate.

105
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:23,240
After all, it was your splendid sword skills
that defeated me.

106
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,200
Me... Integrity Knight Deusolbert Synthesis Seven.

107
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,880
Deusol... bert?

108
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,880
Eugeo?

109
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,760
So you're... from back then...

110
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,400
You're telling me to take your life?

111
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,490
You say it was a splendid battle?

112
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,320
She was just...

113
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,620
She was just an eleven-year-old girl,
and you bound her with chains!

114
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,910
You suspended her from your dragon
and took her away...

115
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,540
...so don't say that, after everything you've done!

116
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,770
Why are you stopping me, Kirito?

117
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,520
That old man doesn't intend to fight anymore.

118
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,980
You can't raise your sword
against someone like that.

119
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,700
He... he's the one who took Alice away!

120
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:09,470
I'm pretty sure the old man doesn't remember.
About taking your Alice away from Rulid Village.

121
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,510
He hasn't forgotten, his memory's been erased.

122
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,730
It's as the black-haired boy says.

123
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:31,950
I apprehended a young girl
and took her away with my dragon?

124
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,870
I don't remember doing such a thing.

125
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,040
You don't remember?

126
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,330
It was only eight years ago.

127
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:43,170
Old man... I mean, Sir Deusolbert.

128
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,920
You were the Integrity Knight in charge of guarding
the northern border of Norlangarth.

129
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,420
That's true, right?

130
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:56,640
Indeed. I oversaw Norlangarth's
northern border in District Seven.

131
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,390
Yes... until eight years ago.

132
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:04,150
At that time, due to a great feat,

133
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:10,150
I was awarded the duty of guarding
the Central Cathedral, as well as this armor.

134
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,780
Do you remember what that feat was?

135
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,030
I'll tell you what it was.

136
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:22,500
Your feat was discovering
Integrity Knight Alice Synthesis Thirty.

137
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:27,130
Administrator gave you credit
for bringing Alice to this tower,

138
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:32,550
but she also had to erase your memories
of that incident.

139
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,720
Integrity Knights have no past.

140
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,430
That's because they've been summoned
from the heavens.

141
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,980
Or so you said.

142
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:46,310
The pontifex must've told you that
right after you awoke as a knight.

143
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,860
To convince you that was why
you couldn't remember anything

144
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,440
from before you became an Integrity Knight.

145
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,200
But to get you to accept that story,

146
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:00,240
it wasn't just your memories of being a human,

147
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:05,460
but also your memories of any other knight's creation
that had to be erased.

148
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:13,130
Because there'd be chaos if a sinner you brought here
showed up the next day as a fellow knight.

149
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,180
I don't remember anything.

150
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,890
Your precious memories were seized
by Administrator,

151
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:25,850
and instead embedded fealty to the Church in you,
turning you into an Integrity Knight.

152
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,190
You're a human, just like us.

153
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,280
Me? A resident of the realm of humanity
like yourselves?

154
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,620
My memories, manipulated? Unbelievable.

155
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:42,790
To think that the pontifex
would cast such a spell on me.

156
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,080
But it's the truth.

157
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,540
There has to be something still in your mind.

158
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:53,210
Something like a precious memory
no art can completely erase

159
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:00,140
Ever since I descended to the realm of humanity,
I keep having the same dream.

160
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,140
A small hand shaking me awake,

161
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,680
and the silver ring worn on its finger.

162
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,150
But when I wake up, no one's there.

163
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:25,790
Administrator stole your memory
of the owner of that hand and ring.

164
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,330
You decide what you're going to do next.

165
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,750
Go back to Administrator
and accept your punishment,

166
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,710
heal your wounds and come after us,

167
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,590
or...

168
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,380
We've been climbing for a while,
so how far up are we now?

169
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,590
The next floor is the twenty-ninth.

170
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:19,720
Another half hour of climbing
and I think we'll reach the fiftieth floor he mentioned.

171
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,640
Are we going to charge straight in?

172
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,060
Well...

173
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,560
Where'd those come from?

174
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,200
Based on the battle with that old man,
they're not used to combo moves.

175
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,620
More like they have almost no experience.

176
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:51,920
I'd like to think we have a chance
if we can get into one-on-one close combat.

177
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,210
But not only are we up against multiple enemies,
they're also waiting for us fully prepared.

178
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,090
Then should we look for another route,
instead of going straight in?

179
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,800
I don't know about that.

180
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:09,100
Cardinal made it clear
that these stairs were the only way.

181
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,850
And even if we did find a shortcut,
we could still get caught in a pincer attack later on.

182
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:18,280
I'd rather take out the knights on the fiftieth floor,
even if we have to use the ace up our sleeve.

183
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,900
Right. The Perfect Weapon Control art.

184
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,780
Yeah. Maybe the instant we charge
onto the fiftieth floor,

185
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:30,120
we can strike first with the Perfect Weapon Control art
and neutralize as many knights as we can.

186
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,620
Uh, about that...

187
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:40,630
My Perfect Weapon Control art isn't a direct attack
like that Integrity Knight's.

188
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,880
R-Really?

189
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,140
Well, Cardinal wrote the command for me, so...

190
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,020
I mean, I was the one who imagined
what kind of technique it should be...

191
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,400
Well, let me take a look at the command.

192
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,230
O-Okay.

193
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:04,610
I see. You're right,
I wouldn't exactly say it's for offense,

194
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,080
but depending on its use, it'll come in handy.

195
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,830
And it seems like it'll be compatible
with my Perfect Weapon Control art.

196
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,830
Really? What's your skill like?

197
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,040
You'll have to wait and see.

198
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,590
Okay, should we...

199
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,480
You two... who are you?

200
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,870
Th-They're kids?

201
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,390
Next time: The Relentless Knight.
