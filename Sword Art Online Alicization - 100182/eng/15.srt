1
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,830
Um...

2
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,410
I'm... no...

3
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,790
I'm Fizel, an Axiom Church sister-in-training.

4
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,800
And this is my fellow sister-in-training.

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,220
I-I'm Linel.

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,310
Um, are you two the intruders
from the Dark Territory we heard about?

7
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,520
I'm not good with kids.

8
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,400
I'll leave this to you.

9
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,690
U-Um, well...

10
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,400
We're actually from the Human Empire,

11
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:00,120
but as for being intruders, well...
you're not wrong.

12
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,920
Geez! They look like ordinary humans, Nel!

13
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,420
There's not any horns or tails.

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,670
All I said was
that was how the books described them!

15
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,430
You're the one who jumped to conclusions, Zel!

16
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,680
Um...

17
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,890
Won't you get into trouble
if you're found talking to us?

18
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,690
This morning, all the monks, nuns
and apprentices

19
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:37,320
were ordered to lock themselves
in their rooms.

20
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:43,410
So there's no risk of getting caught
even if we go take a look at the intruders!

21
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,750
They're human?

22
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,130
Yes, they're human.

23
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,050
You were thrown into prison,
but you broke your spiritual chains and fled,

24
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,180
not only that,
they say you defeated two Integrity Knights,

25
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,390
so we were sure
you were monsters of darkness,

26
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,770
or else actual dark knights had invaded,
and that's why we were waiting.

27
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,190
One last thing...
may we ask what your names are?

28
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,530
I'm Eugeo.

29
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,830
This is Kirito behind me.

30
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,540
Don't you have family names?

31
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,420
No, since we're the children of settlers.

32
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,630
Is that true for you as well?

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,880
No.

34
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,210
We do have them.

35
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,270
My name is Linel Synthesis Twenty-eight.

36
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,990
The Relentless Knight

37
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,250
Euge—

38
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,510
And I'm Fizel Synthesis Twenty-nine.

39
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,220
You're...

40
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,550
Integrity...

41
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,520
No need to be so scared, Mr. Eugeo!

42
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,620
It's only a paralysis poison.

43
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,080
Of course, the only difference is
whether you'll die here or on the fiftieth floor.

44
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,000
You must be wondering, aren't you?

45
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,670
How two children like us
became Integrity Knights, right?

46
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,590
We were born and raised inside the cathedral.

47
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,100
Administrator ordered the monks
and nuns here to create us.

48
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:41,690
To use us in an experiment to restore completely lost life
with a resurrection sacred art.

49
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,570
We received our Callings at the age of five.

50
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,080
Our job was to kill each other.

51
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,290
We were given toylike swords,

52
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,830
and then we'd pair off,
taking turns stabbing each other.

53
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,330
Administrator's resurrection sacred art
was such a disaster at first, wasn't it?

54
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,040
There were kids who exploded into bits,

55
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,540
and others who ended up
as weird chunks of flesh.

56
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,010
And some who, even though they came back to life,
were different people!

57
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:52,180
We wanted to avoid any unnecessary pain,
and not being able to come back to life,

58
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,310
so we researched together

59
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,680
and found that if we could kill cleanly with one strike,
the pain would be minimal,

60
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,060
and the odds of being resurrected would be higher.

61
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,730
But...

62
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,530
the question was how to deal that strike.

63
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:15,580
If we could cut off the head or strike the heart
as quickly and smoothly as possible...

64
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:22,500
But in the end, it seemed that
it was too difficult to master complete resurrection,

65
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,800
and around the time we turned eight,
the resurrection experiment was abandoned.

66
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:33,470
We'd started out with 30 comrades,
but by then, only Zel and I were left.

67
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:44,730
Since we'd survived, Administrator made us
Integrity Knights as a special exception.

68
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:50,610
But she said we hadn't learned enough
to go on guard duty like the other knights,

69
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,910
so we've been studying the laws and sacred arts
for two years now, but...

70
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,870
Honestly, we're so sick of it.

71
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:04,670
We'd been discussing how to quickly earn
our dragons and Divine Objects,

72
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:09,460
when we heard the warning that the cathedral
had been infiltrated by minions of the Dark Territory.

73
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,800
We thought that if we could capture
and execute them before the other knights,

74
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:21,520
Administrator would make us proper knights,
so that's why we were waiting on the stairs.

75
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,520
We're sorry for using poison.

76
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:33,240
It's just that we wanted
to bring you to the fiftieth floor alive, if possible.

77
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,910
Oh, please don't worry.

78
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,410
Fizel and I are really good at killing!

79
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,120
It won't hurt!

80
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,460
Central Cathedral, Fiftieth Floor
Great Hall of Ghostly Light

81
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,060
Standing over there are the members
of the Four Whirling Blades,

82
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,310
as well as Vice Commander Fanatio Synthesis Two.

83
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,940
If Sir Fanatio of the Heaven-Piercing Blade
bothered to show up,

84
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,280
the senate must be panicking more
than we thought.

85
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,740
What are you two young apprentices doing
on this honorable knights' battlefield?

86
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,530
How ridiculous!

87
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,830
It's because you bring honor
and tradition into battle

88
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:28,290
that you mighty Integrity Knights lost
not once, but twice!

89
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,130
But there's no need to worry.

90
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,380
To keep the knights
from disgracing themselves any further,

91
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,720
we've captured the intruders for you!

92
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,270
We're going to decapitate these intruders now,

93
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:47,810
so watch closely
and be sure to report it to the pontifex!

94
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,940
Surely honorable Integrity Knights such as yourselves
would never stoop to stealing the credit.

95
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,370
How?

96
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,910
I can't mo—

97
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,310
The paralysis will wear off in a few minutes.

98
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,310
Once you can move your lips again,

99
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:37,650
start reciting the Perfect Weapon Control art
without drawing the knights' attention.

100
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,990
When you're ready,
hold it and wait for my signal.

101
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,920
You must be wondering
how I could move, aren't you?

102
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,670
You two gave it away.

103
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,010
All of the monks and nuns had been ordered
not to leave their rooms.

104
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,720
But no one in the cathedral
could possibly violate that order.

105
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:12,060
So if you weren't obeying the order,
you couldn't be actual apprentices.

106
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,450
Not only that, those scabbards on your hips...
they're made of ruby oak, right?

107
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,360
The only material that won't rot

108
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,620
even if it makes contact
with swords made of toxic Ruberyl steel.

109
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,500
There's no way you'd have something like that
if you were a sister-in-training.

110
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:35,210
That's why I started reciting a poison-dissolving art
before you got near us.

111
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,420
Although it took some time to dissolve.

112
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,840
Strength isn't just about sword speed.

113
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,780
I won't kill you.

114
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,240
Instead, watch closely.

115
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,950
At how strong the Integrity Knights
you're mocking actually are!

116
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,130
Sorry to have kept you waiting, Sir Fanatio.

117
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,760
Kirito the Swordsman... is coming!

118
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:50,080
You insolent criminal,
thinking you can battle Sir Fanatio one-on-one...

119
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,790
We, the Four Whirling Blades,
are your opponents!

120
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,750
You four, stay back.

121
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,500
I'll be his opponent.

122
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,250
Yes.

123
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,050
System Call.

124
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,970
Enhance Armament!

125
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,260
Ki—

126
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,770
<i>My voice.</i>

127
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,690
<i>Now I can...</i>

128
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,360
System Call.

129
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,910
You may be a criminal, but if you've lived in the capital,
you must know what a mirror is.

130
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,630
That instrument is capable of reflecting Solus's light
more or less completely.

131
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:26,630
Long ago, the eminent pontifex
used one thousand huge mirrors

132
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:32,050
to focus Solus' midsummer light on a single spot,
producing pure white flames.

133
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,770
Within minutes,
those flames melted away a man-sized boulder.

134
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:46,150
The pontifex then bound the thousand mirrors
with a divine skill, forged them...

135
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,200
and created a single sword.

136
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,290
This Divine Object, the Heaven-Piercing Blade.

137
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,500
Do you understand, criminal?

138
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:06,960
What pierced your stomach and foot
was the power of the sun god, Solus.

139
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,930
<i>A sword... that can reflect light?</i>

140
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:16,270
And now, farewell, you young, foolish criminal.

141
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,640
Discharge!

142
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,710
You saw, didn't you?

143
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,630
You're looking at me that way, too...

144
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,840
just like that man!

145
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:55,430
Even traitors like you,
targeting the Church,

146
00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:00,060
the instant you discover I'm a woman,
you can't fight me seriously?

147
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,440
I am an Integrity Knight!

148
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,160
I see. So that sword and that skill.

149
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,290
They allow you to exchange blows
without revealing that you're a woman.

150
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,330
Isn't that right, Lady Fanatio?

151
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,130
H-How dare you!

152
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,880
Just so you know,

153
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,210
the reason I was shocked just now

154
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:35,140
was because your spirit became so weak
the moment your helmet broke.

155
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,100
Hiding your face and your sword style...

156
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:43,230
...aren't you the one
who's most conscious of being of woman?

157
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,770
Shut up! I'll kill you no matter what!

158
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,280
I intend to do the same.

159
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,530
I don't intend to hold back
because you're a woman.

160
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,990
I've lost plenty of battles to swordswomen!

161
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,100
Incredible.

162
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,290
I understand.

163
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,370
Criminal.

164
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,250
I can see that you're unlike
the ones I've fought before.

165
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:57,720
No man has tried to seriously slash me
after seeing this detestable face.

166
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,680
Detestable, huh?

167
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,230
Then for whose sake do you comb your hair

168
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,520
and apply color to your lips?

169
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,490
I'm fighting to take down the church
and the pontifex

170
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:25,790
so that humans like you can express love normally
and lead normal lives!

171
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,340
I see that you're not a minion of darkness
as the prime senator said.

172
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,550
But that doesn't mean
you're not extremely dangerous.

173
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:41,180
You could still disrupt the Church and us knights
not just with your sword, but with your words as well.

174
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,720
Our most crucial mission as Integrity Knights

175
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,100
is to protect the Human Empire
and those who reside there.

176
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,440
That's why I must defeat you.

177
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,940
Even if it means trampling on my pride as a knight.

178
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,200
Light concealed within the Heaven-Piercing Blade,
cast off your shackles!

179
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,490
Release Recollection!

180
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,390
You...

181
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,150
...stupid idiot!

182
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,940
<i>Now!</i>

183
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,450
<i>Now's my only chance!</i>

184
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:43,490
Enhance Armament!

185
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,540
Th-This is...

186
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,380
Bloom! Blue Roses!

187
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,050
Curse you.

188
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,100
Kirito!

189
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,980
Hang on. I'll cast a healing art right—

190
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,810
Don't!

191
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,520
Keep the skill going!

192
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,530
This...

193
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,570
...isn't enough to bring her down.

194
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,410
System Call!

195
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,340
You...

196
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,260
None of you...

197
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,470
...know what justice is!

198
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,860
Stop! Stop right now!

199
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,240
<i>I can't win. Not how I am now.</i>

200
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,460
<i>I can't beat her.</i>

201
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:17,170
You can't defeat her with hatred, Eugeo.

202
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:25,090
You didn't come all this way
because you hated the Integrity Knights, right?

203
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:31,640
Aren't you're here because you want to get Alice back...
because you love her?

204
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,810
And those feelings aren't in any way
inferior to her justice.

205
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,900
It's the same for me.

206
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,190
I want to protect everyone in this world.

207
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,900
You... Alice...

208
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,110
I even want to protect her.

209
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,410
So right now, we can't lose to her no matter what.

210
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,790
Isn't that right, Eugeo?

211
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,090
Enhance Armament!

212
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:39,390
Next time: The Osmanthus Knight.
