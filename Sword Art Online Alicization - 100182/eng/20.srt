1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,140
Central Cathedral, Ninety-Fifth Floor  Morning Star Lookout

2
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,650
Kirito.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,330
You didn't carry me all this way, did you?

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,660
I did.

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,830
It was a hassle.

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,000
So a little appreciationâ€”

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,960
What're you doing?

8
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,880
Oh no! You're drenched with sweat!

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,550
And my clothes are stained!

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,590
Get away from me right now!

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,970
What did you say?

12
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,100
Ouch!

13
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,980
Synthesis

14
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,530
Where's your comrade?

15
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,120
You mean Eugeo?

16
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,000
Where do you think this Eugeo is right now?

17
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,210
If he took the stairs from the Cloudtop Garden,

18
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:38,510
he must've run into the most powerful opponent
before reaching this floor.

19
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,470
Most powerful opponent?

20
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,010
Uncle...

21
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,560
His Eminence, the Knight Commander Bercouli.

22
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,390
Eugeo, where are you?

23
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,400
I know!

24
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,360
System Call.

25
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,360
Generate Umbra Element.

26
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,240
Adhere Possession.

27
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,330
Object ID, WLSS703.

28
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,450
Discharge.

29
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,040
What are you doing?

30
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,040
I'm trying to locate the Blue Rose Sword.

31
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,210
Since Eugeo would never let it go.

32
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,250
Below us.

33
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,050
Wait.

34
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,760
Did you treat my wound?

35
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,890
Yeah.

36
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,020
I managed to stop the bleeding,
but my sacred art skills can only do so much.

37
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,230
Can your right eye be healed?

38
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,860
At this time,
there aren't sufficient spatial resources.

39
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,280
It won't be possible to treat it
until Solus has risen.

40
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,290
I still feel some pain,
and the vision in my right eye is somewhat limited,

41
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,960
but neither will prevent me from fighting.

42
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,380
B-But...

43
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,460
Besides...

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,670
I'd like to feel it a bit longer.

45
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:06,640
This pain, which is the proof
that I've decided to fight the Axiom Church.

46
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:08,930
Alice.

47
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,020
All right.

48
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,820
If we go into battle,
I'll protect your right side.

49
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,710
Did Eugeo cause this?

50
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,460
Yeah. There's no doubt.

51
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,340
This is his Blue Rose Sword
under the Perfect Weapon Control art.

52
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,510
Still, who knew it would be this devastating?

53
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,980
Uncle? Uncle!

54
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,610
Is that...

55
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,570
Uncle?

56
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,620
This isn't Eugeo's art.

57
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,370
Long ago, Uncle told me...

58
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:19,000
that Prime Senator Chudelkin was given
the authority to turn anyone to stone.

59
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,550
I believe the name of the command is Deep Freeze.

60
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,600
Then it was his own ally, the prime senator,
who cast the art on the knight commander?

61
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,310
But why?

62
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:37,770
Uncle seemed to have secret doubts
about the orders issued by the senate.

63
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:43,230
But he told himself the Human Empire
could never know peace

64
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:47,530
without the Axiom Church's rule,
and spent countless days battling.

65
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,990
The senate may have all the authority in the world,

66
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,330
but this... there's no reason
for him to receive treatment like this!

67
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,420
Uncle!

68
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,180
Uncle...

69
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,560
Stop it! Please stop now!
Your body will break! Uncle!

70
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,650
Hey, little one.

71
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,650
Don't cry so much.

72
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,110
It'll ruin your good looks.

73
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,450
Uncle...

74
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,530
I see.

75
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,740
You've overcome that wall at last.

76
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,120
The Seal of the Right Eye I couldn't break,
even after 300 years.

77
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,590
Uncle... I... I'm...

78
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,760
Don't make that face. I'm happy.

79
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,930
Now there's nothing left for me to teach you.

80
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,640
That's... that's not true at all!

81
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,140
There's so many things
I want to learn from you!

82
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,860
I know you can do it.

83
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:08,570
Guide this twisted world to its proper state.

84
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,660
Hey, brat.

85
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,490
Look after her for me.

86
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,700
I will.

87
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:27,090
Your partner was taken away
by Prime Senator Chudelkin.

88
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,050
Most likely to the pontifex's chambers.

89
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:39,930
Hurry, before that boy is deceived
by the labyrinth of his memories.

90
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,560
Uncle...

91
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,530
This is...

92
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:18,560
Usually, the only person mad enough to wield two swords
is a pretentious high-ranking noblemen,

93
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,310
but for some reason, it suits you.

94
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,980
You think so?

95
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,980
Still, there's no way
I can swing two swords at the same time.

96
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,740
Anyway.

97
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:37,200
It seems that Eugeo has already been captured
by the pontifex.

98
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,450
We'd better hurry,
because her actions aren't bound by human logic.

99
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,580
Have you spoken to Administrator before?

100
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,540
Only once.

101
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,800
It was six years ago.

102
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,260
I awoke, having lost all of my memories,

103
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:01,810
and faced my summoner, the pontifex said to be
ruling the Human Empire on behalf of the gods.

104
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,350
Those mirror-like silver eyes
that reflected all light...

105
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:12,030
Yes. I understand now.
I was deeply afraid of the pontifex at that time.

106
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,320
"I can never defy her.

107
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,370
I'm to accept her every word without question,
and offer her my everything."

108
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:25,750
I know now it was that overwhelming terror
that compelled me to feel that way.

109
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,710
Alice.

110
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,800
I'll be fine.

111
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,920
I've already made up my mind.

112
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,180
For the sake of my younger sister
residing far away in the north...

113
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,510
For the family I've never seen yet,
and for all of the people,

114
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,930
I'll do what I believe is right.

115
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,940
Now then, let's hurry.

116
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,860
For all we know,
before we confront the pontifex,

117
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:53,650
we may have to battle the prime senator.

118
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,860
H-H-Hey! Is it okay
to leave the knight commander like this?

119
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,370
We can either force Chudelkin to reverse the art,

120
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,330
or else slay him. That's all there is to it.

121
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,080
Hey.

122
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,040
What is it?

123
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,960
I keep hearing the name "Prime Senator Chudelkin,"

124
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,010
but who are these senators, anyway?

125
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:24,100
To be honest, that's never been clearly explained,
even to the Integrity Knights.

126
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:30,190
I heard that they're on floors ninety-six and above,
but knights are prohibited from entering that area.

127
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,860
What's their job?

128
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,320
The Taboo Index.

129
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,660
They confirm and monitor whether all residents
of the Human Empire are obeying the Taboo Index.

130
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,530
That's the senate's job.

131
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,250
And whenever someone runs afoul of the Taboos,

132
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,210
they send an Integrity Knight
to deal with the situation.

133
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:55,130
<i>In other words,
the senate is like a proxy for the pontifex?</i>

134
00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:00,630
<i>But how could someone as cautious as Administrator
give them that much authority?</i>

135
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,060
This is the senate?

136
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,600
Yes. It should be.

137
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,030
Sacred arts?

138
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,280
It doesn't seem to be an attack spell.

139
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,370
Let's go in.

140
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,680
S-Severed heads?

141
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,100
No. They seem to have their bodies attached.

142
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,270
They're like the one from that time!

143
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,150
Do you know them?

144
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,940
Yeah.

145
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,320
One appeared after we fought Raios and Humbert
at the Swordcraft Academy.

146
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,370
There's no doubt it was these guys.

147
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,980
System Call.

148
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,030
Display Rebelling Index.

149
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:44,490
So these are the senators of the Axiom Church,
which rules the Human Empire.

150
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,490
Was it the pontifex who created such a spectacle?

151
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,290
Yeah, probably.

152
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:54,670
She must've abducted people skilled in the sacred arts
from all over the Human Empire,

153
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,500
and turned them
into surveillance devices called senators.

154
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,840
Unforgivable!

155
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,600
Oh no! Oh no, this won't do!

156
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,890
This won't do!

157
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,060
Whose voice is that?

158
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,230
The Prime Senator... Chudelkin.

159
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,020
This won't do!

160
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:30,200
This won't do! It won't! It simply won't do!

161
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:50,260
If you try to initiate a sacred art,
I will cut out your tongue at the root.

162
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,930
You...

163
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,980
Number Thirty! What are you doing here?

164
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,310
By rights you should've perished
along with one of those rebels!

165
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,270
Don't you dare call me by a number!

166
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,070
My name is Alice.

167
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,530
And I am no longer Thirty.

168
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,700
You! Why are you...

169
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,450
Thirtyâ€” Knight Alice,
why aren't you slashing this guy?

170
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:20,460
He's a rebel against the Church.
A pawn of the Dark Territory, don't you remember?

171
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,920
It's true that he's a rebel.

172
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,380
But he's not a member of the realm of darkness.

173
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,130
He's just like I am now.

174
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,930
You're planning to betray us,
you miserable knight?

175
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,100
You damned Integrity Knights are nothing but puppets!

176
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,690
Mere dolls who do exactly what I order you to do!

177
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,150
It was the Axiom Church
that turned us into puppets.

178
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,070
You sealed away our memories
through the Synthesis Ritual

179
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,360
and instilled fealty into us by force,

180
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:55,700
after which you made us believe the myth
that we were knights summoned from the heavens.

181
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,210
Yes. That's exactly right.

182
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,630
I still remember it clearly.

183
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:09,470
The sight of you, so young, innocent and sweet,
with tears streaming down your face as you begged!

184
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:17,100
"Please! Don't let me forget!
Don't let me forget the people I love!"

185
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:24,690
Even now, I can enjoy
just thinking about it all night long!

186
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,860
You were brought here from some rural area,
and for the first two years,

187
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,530
you were raised as a sister-in-training.

188
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:37,540
You were such a tomboy, you'd find ways around the rules
to sneak off to the Centoria summer solstice festival!

189
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:43,830
Still, you did your best, believing that if you studied hard,
you'd get to go home one day, right?

190
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,800
But that was never going to happen.

191
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:53,300
Once you'd raised your sacred art authority level
high enough, it was time for forced synthesis!

192
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,060
That tear-stained face of yours
when you realized you'd never go home again...

193
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:03,520
Really, I wanted to turn it to stone right then,
so I could display it in my room for all eternity!

194
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,820
You just said something odd.

195
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,990
Forced synthesis?

196
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,660
If I didn't know better, I'd suspect
there was a Synthesis Ritual that wasn't forced.

197
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:20,080
Your ears are sharper than I thought.
That's exactly right.

198
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:24,540
Six years ago, you stubbornly refused

199
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,880
to recite the secret commands
required for a normal Synthesis Ritual.

200
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:33,340
Really, you were the most insolent brat imaginable!

201
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:38,060
So we had no choice
but to pause the automated senators,

202
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:43,560
and have them conduct a ritual to pry open the door
protecting what you held so dear!

203
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:49,020
Well, I did get to see the rarest of shows...
what a feast for the eyes!

204
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,070
<i>He's waiting for something.</i>

205
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:59,030
<i>Is this rambling story of his
a ploy to keep us in this room?</i>

206
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,620
Prime Senator Chudelkin...

207
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,960
I can see that you've enjoyed your circumstances.

208
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,300
In that case, you should have no regrets.

209
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:18,050
I'm tired of hearing your stories.

210
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,740
It's not all about commands! Idiot! Idiot!

211
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,070
Chudelkin!

212
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,780
Hey!

213
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,290
System Call! Generate Lu...

214
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,250
Watch out for a sacred art surprise attack!

215
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,580
Roger that!

216
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,510
I thought I heard him chanting.

217
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,720
Could it be that Chudelkin escaped
to the hundredth floor?

218
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,720
But then where are the stairs leading up there?

219
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,360
So there were still Integrity Knights remaining?

220
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,650
No, that can't be.

221
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,290
Eugeo!

222
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,210
You...

223
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,380
It can't be.

224
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,590
It's too soon.

225
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,380
Too soon for what?

226
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,430
For the ritual to be completed.

227
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,560
Your partner...

228
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,270
Eugeo has already been synthesized.

229
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,230
No way.

230
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,230
It can't be. Because...

231
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:57,570
Yes. Even though it hasn't been even an hour
since Eugeo fought Bercouli.

232
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,820
That's right. It's not possible.

233
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,450
Eugeo can't...

234
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,290
Pull yourself together!

235
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,250
If you waver now,
you'll lose any chance to save him!

236
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,920
Save?

237
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,750
That's right.

238
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,920
You told me so yourself.

239
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,960
That there's a way
to restore an Integrity Knight's true memories.

240
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,930
So we should be able
to restore Eugeo back to who he was.

241
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,720
To achieve that, we must overcome this dilemma,
no matter what.

242
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,060
Leave this to me.

243
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,400
Don't let your guard down.

244
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,820
That knight is no longer the Eugeo you knew.

245
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,240
Right.

246
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,620
Eugeo, do you know who I am?

247
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,450
I'm Kirito. Your partner.

248
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,210
Since we left Rulid two years ago,
we've been together the whole time, remember?

249
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,290
Sorry. I don't know who you are.

250
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,670
But thank you.

251
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,380
For what?

252
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,760
For bringing me my sword.

253
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,480
Incarnate Arms?

254
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,060
What's that?

255
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,070
A secret art used by Integrity Knights
since ancient times.

256
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,030
It's neither a sacred art
nor Perfect Weapon Control art,

257
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,030
and you can move objects
solely with your own willpower.

258
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,950
I've heard that only a handful of knights,
including Uncle, can use it.

259
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,080
It's not a ritual that a newly-created knight like Eugeo
could have mastered.

260
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,670
What do you plan to do with that sword?

261
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,460
I'm going to fight you.

262
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,720
Because that's what she wishes.

263
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:46,180
Eugeo, just because you've been ordered to,

264
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,310
you're going to fight
without even understanding why?

265
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,600
I don't need a reason to fight.

266
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,730
She gives me what I want.

267
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,650
That's enough for me.

268
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,320
What you want?

269
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,360
Is it more important than Alice?

270
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,160
I don't know. I don't want to know.

271
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,870
About you, or who you are.

272
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,750
I've had enough.

273
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,790
Eugeo...

274
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,680
I have nothing more to say to you.

275
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,440
Eugeo, you probably don't remember,
but you learned your sword skills from me.

276
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,570
As the master,
I'm not ready to lose to my student just yet!

277
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:39,440
Next time: The 32nd Knight.
