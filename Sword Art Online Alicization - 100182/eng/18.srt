1
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,980
The Legendary Hero

2
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,550
Hey. Sorry to keep you waiting.

3
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:01,970
All right, before we get started,
would you mind telling me one thing?

4
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,220
What's that?

5
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,720
Uh... you know...

6
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,980
Is the vice commander... Is Fanatio dead?

7
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,610
She's alive.

8
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,820
She should be receiving treatment now.

9
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,740
Is that so?
Then I won't go so far as to take your life.

10
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,330
I don't like it.

11
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,620
What's that, youngster?

12
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,830
Since you're on a floor this high up,

13
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,920
does that mean you're the leader
of the Integrity Knights?

14
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,920
Yeah. That's right.

15
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,590
Then Fanatio isn't your only subordinate, is she?

16
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,220
Eldrie and the Four Whirling Blades,
not to mention...

17
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,980
do you care at all
whether Alice is alive or dead?

18
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,020
Oh, is that what this is about?

19
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,360
How should I put this...

20
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,400
Eldrie is young lady Alice's apprentice,

21
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,360
while the Four Whirling Blades,
Dakira, Jayce, Hoveren and Geero,

22
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,280
they're Fanatio's apprentices.

23
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,870
And Fanatio happens to be my apprentice.

24
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,210
I'm not one to carry my personal grudges
onto the battlefield,

25
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,130
but if someone kills my apprentice,

26
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:19,090
I do feel obliged to at least avenge her...
that's all there is to it.

27
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,720
Well, it's possible that
little Alice looks up to me as her mentor,

28
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,440
but frankly, if we were to fight seriously,
I don't know who'd be stronger at this point.

29
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,230
If it were six years ago, when she first became a knight,
it would be a different story.

30
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,650
Well, I have no intention of losing to you,

31
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:47,200
nor do I think you defeated her,
since she's as powerful as me.

32
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:53,170
According to the prime senator,
you have a partner, right?

33
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:59,340
Since he's not here, that must mean
he's dueling the young lady somewhere right now.

34
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,720
Well, something like that.

35
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,090
By the way,

36
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,560
after I've slashed you,
who will show up to avenge you?

37
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,730
Don't worry. I don't have a mentor.

38
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,580
<i>The Norkia style secret skill, Lightning Slash!
No, it's similar, but not quite it.</i>

39
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,620
<i>Holding his sword straight up like that
would require extra motion before activating the skill.</i>

40
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:40,210
<i>In that case, I'll strike first with the Aincrad style
secret skill, Sonic Leap.</i>

41
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,470
I haven't seen that stance before, youngster.

42
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,470
By any chance, are you a continuous attack wielder?

43
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,480
What does it matter
if I can use continuous attacks or not?

44
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:59,570
Oh, it's just that some of the dark knights
from the Dark Territory also used continuous attacks,

45
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:04,900
and I fought them a couple of times,
but they're not really pleasant memories.

46
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:10,700
After all, I couldn't pull off those spastic, dexterous skills
if my life depended on it.

47
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,330
In other words, you're telling me to fight
using conventional moves, like an Integrity Knight?

48
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:22,920
Oh, no. Continuous attack or whatever...
go ahead and use it as much as you want.

49
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:29,930
And don't take this as retaliation,
but I'm going to use my trump card early on, all right?

50
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,940
<i>If that sword is already
under Perfect Weapon Control,</i>

51
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:42,070
<i>then my only chance will be to unleash Sonic Leap
while he's activating his skill.</i>

52
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,320
Integrity Knight Commander
Bercouli Synthesis One...

53
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:48,910
...is coming!

54
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,240
<i>Bercouli!</i>

55
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,880
<i>His swing slashed through that spot a moment ago.</i>

56
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,530
That was a bit too close, wasn't it?

57
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,240
I didn't expect you
to charge at me that ferociously.

58
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,120
Sorry. I almost killed you.

59
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,000
What was that move just now?

60
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,880
Didn't I just tell you that I'd use my trump card?

61
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,550
It's not like I simply sliced the air
with that swing.

62
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,970
What I did, so to speak,
was to slice the future a bit.

63
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,390
Slice... the future?

64
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,190
The first time I saw those dark knights'
continuous attacks,

65
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,150
I'd only just started as an Integrity Knight.

66
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:09,070
The sword techniques ingrained in my body
were all about unleashing the force of a single strike,

67
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:16,790
while the continuous attacks focused on
how to handle incoming strikes and land your own.

68
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,250
It's obvious which is more practical.

69
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,130
You can bet I was beaten senseless at first.

70
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,630
Then I thought about
how my sword could hit my opponent.

71
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,590
And the answer was this here.

72
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,640
Originally, this sword was part
of a Divine Object called a "clock"

73
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,440
that was installed on a wall
of the Central Cathedral.

74
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,020
I'm told this clock had existed
since the world was first created.

75
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:54,530
The pontifex called it the "System Clock,"
or something strange like that.

76
00:07:54,530 --> 00:08:00,700
Little Alice's Osmanthus Blade
slices through the horizontal axis of space,

77
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,170
while this one pierces the vertical axis of time.

78
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,050
It's called the Time-Splitting Sword,
the blade that pierces time.

79
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,430
<i>The force from that sword's strike
stays in the spot it passed through.</i>

80
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,300
<i>Which means I don't stand a chance
in close combat,</i>

81
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,140
<i>so long-range combat is my only option!</i>

82
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:28,230
System Call. Connect Armament.
Search Archived Memory. Extra Core. Image convert.

83
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,230
"In that case, I'd better attack from a distance..."
that's what you're thinking, right?

84
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,400
Everyone who's seen my move does.

85
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,570
Including Fanatio and Alice,
the Integrity Knights summoned after me

86
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,240
tend to pick a long-range
Perfect Weapon Control art

87
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,620
because they saw my move...
or maybe I'm mistaken.

88
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,920
Those guys may not look it,
but they're a pretty competitive bunch.

89
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:54,720
However, let me warn you,
I've never lost to any of them in a match.

90
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:02,640
Well, I can see myself being beaten
by little Alice one of these days.

91
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,520
Anyway, I'm looking forward to this.

92
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,940
The chance to see the skills you used
to repulse one knight after another.

93
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,610
You're so confident.

94
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,620
Are you going to approach me, youngster?

95
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,620
Let me say, I won't hold back this time.

96
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,960
Enhance Armament!

97
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,300
<i>That's when...</i>

98
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,310
<i>Lend me your strength,</i>

99
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,520
<i>Blue Rose Sword!</i>

100
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,560
Release Recollection!

101
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:39,530
Listen. There are two phases
to the Perfect Weapon Control art.

102
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,240
Enhancing and Release.

103
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,780
Enhancing and...

104
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,160
Release?

105
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:49,460
Enhancing awakens
your weapon's memory by sections,

106
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,460
causing it to manifest as a new offensive skill.

107
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:57,090
And Release, as the name implies,
awakens all of your weapon's memories,

108
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,840
unleashing its savage power.

109
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,840
Ah, I get it.

110
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,770
Eldrie was able to extend the range of his Frostscale Whip
and cause it to split by enhancing it.

111
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,280
And the whip transforming into a snake,
that was the Release, huh?

112
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:27,750
That's correct. However,
it's still too soon for you two to use the Release art.

113
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,870
Wh-Why is that?

114
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,420
You heard me say "savage power," didn't you?

115
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,880
The offensive power generated
by the release of memories

116
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,050
cannot possibly be controlled by a swordsman
who's only just learned the art.

117
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,510
All the more so
when it's a high-level Divine Object.

118
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,720
You could get dragged in along with your opponent,
so one wrong move,

119
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,140
and you could lose your life.

120
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,870
I never thought I'd see a swordsman
throw away his sword while facing an opponent.

121
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,120
Did you come up with
that way of fighting yourself?

122
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,450
No, my partner taught it to me.

123
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:15,790
He told me everything on a battlefield
can be used as a weapon or a trap.

124
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,170
I see. Taking advantage
of your surroundings, huh?

125
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,800
Well, I admit that you won this round,

126
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,640
but I won't concede defeat like this!

127
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,610
The Blue Rose Sword contains two sleeping memories,
eternal ice and the rose.

128
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:50,290
Eternal ice has the ability to freeze everything.

129
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,160
And the rose's ability is...

130
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,380
Bloom! Blue Roses!

131
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,300
Wh-What did you do?

132
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:08,220
These roses are blooming
because they're absorbing our life.

133
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,890
You brat. You...

134
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,900
Don't tell me you intended
to take us both out from the start?

135
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,980
Please don't get the wrong idea.

136
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,150
I might be superior to you in just one area,

137
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,110
and that's in my total amount of life.

138
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,530
Based on your appearance, you must've been over forty
when you became an Integrity Knight.

139
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,580
Needless to say,
your maximum life has decreased.

140
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,630
My life, however, is nearing its maximum.

141
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,170
Even though I received a blow from your sword,
my total amount should still be higher.

142
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,050
That's what I bet on.

143
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,050
What did you just say?

144
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,810
I became an Integrity Knight?

145
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,270
You talk as if you know all about our past lives.

146
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,980
That's exactly what I can't forgive about you people.

147
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,270
You've forgotten who you were.

148
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,950
You've dedicated your swords to the Axiom Church,
without knowing what it really is,

149
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:10,450
and act like you're the sole guardians
of justice and the law!

150
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:16,160
You're not a divine knight
summoned from the heavens by the pontifex.

151
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,500
Your mother gave birth to you,
and you were given the name Bercouli...

152
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,800
you're a human like me!

153
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,340
Bercouli, you're the protagonist
of a fairy tale in my village.

154
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,310
What are you saying?

155
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,600
You should recognize my sword.

156
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,570
That's true... from somewhere...

157
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,440
Right, that day...

158
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:51,200
when I killed the guardian dragon of the north,
there was a sword like that in its lair.

159
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,700
Did you say you killed it?

160
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,290
Those dragon bones...

161
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:01,380
...that was your doing?

162
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:08,170
Did you kill the dragon
that appears in your own story?

163
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:14,140
Have you really forgotten all of it, Bercouli?

164
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,350
In Rulid, the village where I was born,

165
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,020
you're a hero known by everyone,
young and old.

166
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,770
The pontifex abducted you,
sealed away your memories,

167
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:29,360
and turned you into the first Integrity Knight.

168
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,530
And it wasn't just you.

169
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,830
Fanatio, Eldrie, even Alice,

170
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,950
it happened to all of them.

171
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:44,500
Before they were turned into Integrity Knights,
they were humans just like us.

172
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:48,590
Sealed away my memories, you say?

173
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:54,010
I can't bring myself to believe your story
just like that.

174
00:15:54,010 --> 00:16:01,850
But the story about me being a divine knight
summoned from the heavens...

175
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,020
For some reason,
I couldn't accept it for a long time.

176
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,880
Now this is a beautiful sight!

177
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,930
This won't do. This won't do at all,
Knight Commander.

178
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,560
Surely you don't intend to drop dead now, do you?

179
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:49,570
That would clearly be treason
against Her Eminence, the lovely pontifex.

180
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:53,110
When she awakens, she's sure to be livid!

181
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,740
Prime Senator Chudelkin,

182
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:03,500
a snob like you has no business
meddling in a battle between swordsmen.

183
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:11,210
How could you say such a thing,
after going so easy on this vile traitor!

184
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:16,890
Knight Commander, you neglected to use the other side
of that Time-Splitting Sword, did you not?

185
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:22,470
You could've slaughtered that loathsome brat
before he even said a word, if you'd had a mind to!

186
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:27,560
That's what I mean
by treason against the pontifex!

187
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,060
Shut up.

188
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,530
I fought with everything I had.

189
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:39,410
Besides, I know you deceived me.

190
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:45,120
This kid isn't an assassin
from the Dark Territory.

191
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:49,880
Compared to an ugly lump of meat like you,
he's way—

192
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,380
You shut up!

193
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,630
Or I'll tear your head off!

194
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:02,180
We wouldn't have this hassle in the first place
if you damned knights weren't so utterly useless!

195
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:07,560
Seriously, when Her Eminence awakens,
every one of you knights...

196
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:12,440
well, at the least, you and the vice commander
will be reprocessed.

197
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,570
What did you say, you bastard?

198
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,200
System Call! Deep Freeze!

199
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,870
Integrator Unit, ID 001!

200
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:45,470
The fact is, we don't need
a geezer like you anymore, Number One.

201
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,770
I've discovered a pawn
who could be much more useful, haven't I?

202
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,150
Alice.

203
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,400
Eugeo?

204
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,400
What's the matter?

205
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,870
U-Uh, no, it's nothing.

206
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,330
I think we can continue climbing the wall
once the moon rises.

207
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,960
If we can just create wedges,
it shouldn't be too tough.

208
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:13,170
And it doesn't seem like
there are any more minions stationed above us.

209
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,420
It's just that,
aside from the matter of resources,

210
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:25,010
I'm so hungry, just thinking about how many more mels
we need to climb makes me dizzy.

211
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,350
That's why I find you to be so unserious.

212
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,690
What's so devastating about missing a meal or two?
It's not like you're a child.

213
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,780
Yeah, yeah. I'm just a child.

214
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:41,030
I mean, I'm still barely a growing teen.

215
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,910
Unlike you Integrity Knights,
I have to eat or my life will plummet.

216
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,870
I'll have you know
that even Integrity Knights get hungry too,

217
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,460
and unless we eat, our life is depleted.

218
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,130
Hey, hold on! Sorry! Of course you're right!

219
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,380
Sure, if they're alive,
even Integrity Knights get hungry.

220
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,760
Um, come to think of it, back at Cardinal's...

221
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,890
Hey, a gift from the heavens!

222
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,150
See, I found something good.

223
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,980
Why would you keep something like that
in your pocket?

224
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,990
Tap my pocket and find two steamed buns.

225
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,280
But these won't taste good as-is, right?

226
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:31,370
System Call. Generate Thermal Element.

227
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,580
- Burs—
- Are you an idiot?

228
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,460
If you do that,
they'll be burned to a crisp in an instant!

229
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,250
Right...

230
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,090
Wha—

231
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,390
Generate Thermal Element.

232
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,430
Aqueous Element.

233
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,270
Aerial Element.

234
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,480
Vortex Shape.

235
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,640
Burst.

236
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,860
H-Hurry, give me one!

237
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,360
I'm joking.

238
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,960
I see.

239
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,750
I didn't think you could steam buns
without any tools, just elements.

240
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,710
As expected of Selka's older sister,
since she's such a great cook.

241
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,590
What did you just say?

242
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,020
I said you have a younger sister.

243
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:33,930
Younger sister?

244
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,280
I'll tell you about it.

245
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,700
I don't know if you'll accept it or not,

246
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,160
but I'll tell you everything I believe to be true.

247
00:21:52,910 --> 00:22:00,040
Speak. However,
if there's any trace of deceit in your words,

248
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,460
I will slay you on the spot.

249
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,810
Next time: Recollection.
