1
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,990
March 23, 380 in the time
of the realm of humanity

2
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,000
Isn't that the four-thirty bell?

3
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,760
You're right. Is it that late already?

4
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,010
Ronie and Tiese are late.

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,100
They've never been late to clean before,
have they?

6
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,890
I have a bad feeling about this.

7
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,320
I'll go check the primary trainees' dorm.

8
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,950
They might be on their way here,
so you stay and wait for them.

9
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,320
Hey, Kirito, you should use the front—

10
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,870
Jeez, he's always in such a rush.

11
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,680
Thank goodness! We were worr—

12
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,900
Um... are you Elite Disciple Eugeo?

13
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,610
Yes. And you are?

14
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,400
I-I'm Primary Trainee Frenica Cesky.

15
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,110
I-I apologize for coming to see you
without an appointment.

16
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,580
But I just don't know what to do!

17
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,250
You're... Frenica?

18
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:53,250
Um, I know you've gone out of your way
in regard to my issue with Lord Humbert Zizek.

19
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,800
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

20
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:03,140
However, tonight,
Lord Zizek has ordered me to... um...

21
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:08,850
He's ordered me to perform a service
that's difficult to explain.

22
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:18,610
I-If he continues to give me these kinds of orders,
I-I'd rather leave the academy!

23
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,700
I confided in Tiese and Ronie about this.

24
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:27,580
When they heard this, they said they'd go
plead with him to spare me, and left the dorm.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,120
I've been waiting,
but they still haven't returned.

26
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,250
What?

27
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,130
You wait here.

28
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,090
<i>So that was their goal all along?</i>

29
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,760
<i>Not to target me, but Tiese and Ronie!</i>

30
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,980
Taboo Index

31
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,320
Please come in.

32
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:40,000
We just opened a 50-year-old bottle
from the western empire, so why not join us?

33
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,630
It's not something a commoner
would ever get to taste.

34
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,980
No, that's fine.

35
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,770
Actually, Elite Disciple Zizek,

36
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,940
I wanted to ask if my page,
Primary Trainee Tiese Schtrinen,

37
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,570
and Disciple Kirito's page, Primary Trainee
Ronie Arabel, happened to visit your room?

38
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,120
So those two are yours and Sir Kirito's pages?

39
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,920
To suddenly visit the first-seat elite disciple,
who stands at the pinnacle of the student body,

40
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,420
as well as the second-seat elite disciple,
they're certainly brave for primary trainees!

41
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,880
No wonder they're your pages.

42
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,010
That said, they do need to be careful.

43
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,310
Assertiveness can sometimes be taken
as rudeness or disrespect.

44
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:38,150
Wouldn't you agree, Disciple Eugeo?

45
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,900
I will hear your valued opinion another time.

46
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,570
Where are Tiese and Ronie right now?

47
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,260
What's this?

48
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,600
Wh...

49
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,560
What's the meaning of this, Lord Raios?

50
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,070
These measures were unavoidable, Sir Eugeo.

51
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:31,370
Since Primary Trainees Schtrinen and Arabel
disrespected us to an outrageous degree.

52
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,330
Disrespected how?

53
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,370
These two lesser noble girls had the gall
to accuse me, a fourth-rank nobleman,

54
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:45,300
of needlessly abusing my own page
and satisfying my own lust, offending me greatly.

55
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:51,430
After all I've done as the second-seat elite disciple
to guide Frenica down the proper path!

56
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,510
And that's not all, Sir Eugeo.

57
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:02,650
They made the absurd claim that
as Humbert's roommate, I was just as accountable.

58
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:07,610
I mean, the daughter of a mere sixth-rank noble
asking me, the eldest son of a third-rank noble,

59
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,110
"Have you no pride as a noble?"

60
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,450
To have said such a thing...

61
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,960
Still, Lord Raios, even if everything happened
the way you described,

62
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,290
binding them with ropes
and locking them in your bedroom

63
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,420
is surely a flagrant deviation
from the disciple punishment authority!

64
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,510
Disciple punishment authority?

65
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,720
Have you forgotten what the academy rules say?

66
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,600
That "regarding all punishment,
higher law take precedence!"

67
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:47,150
Higher law, as in the Taboo Index,
not to mention the Basic Imperial Law.

68
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:52,820
In other words, as a third-rank noble's eldest son,
what I can exercise on those sixth-rank noble girls

69
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,030
isn't the disciple punishment authority,
but the nobles' judicial authority...

70
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,080
...as is my right!

71
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,750
Hold still. I'm going to discipline you now.

72
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,180
Stop it!

73
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,470
Don't move, commoner!

74
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:28,690
This is a lawful judgment by a noble according
to the Basic Imperial Law and the Taboo Index.

75
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,650
And to obstruct such a judgment
is a serious criminal act.

76
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,870
If you take even one step closer,
you'll become a criminal who has broken the law.

77
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,330
That's...

78
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:42,960
<i>My legs!</i>

79
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,880
No! No!

80
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,650
Senpai! Senpai!

81
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,030
<i>After all, there are things you shouldn't do,
even if it's not forbidden by law.</i>

82
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,200
<i>On the other hand,</i>

83
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,950
<i>there might be things you should do,
even if they're forbidden by law.</i>

84
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,670
N-No! No!

85
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,680
No! Help me! Help me, Eugeo-senpai!

86
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,970
Eugeo-senpai!

87
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:46,020
<i>Tiese and Ronie worked up the courage
to help their friend,</i>

88
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,900
<i>only to be punished by such a cruel law.</i>

89
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,610
<i>A law that can't deter Raios and Humbert,
who ensnared them and are now about to defile them.</i>

90
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,070
<i>If upholding such a law is the "right" thing to do...</i>

91
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,910
<i>I...</i>

92
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,080
<i>I...</i>

93
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,430
<i>What's... this?</i>

94
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,890
<i>No, this is the same as that time.</i>

95
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,020
<i>Unforgivable. It's absolutely...</i>

96
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,690
<i>...unforgivable!</i>

97
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,160
No! No! Senpai!

98
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,320
A-Arm... My arm is... bleeding!

99
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,950
So much blood! My life is decreasing!

100
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,030
Lord Raios, a sacred arts spell...

101
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,330
No, a normal spell won't heal this in time!

102
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,540
Your life! Please share some of your life!

103
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:45,390
Magnificent! I've never seen
anyone commit such a crime before.

104
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,480
Though the nobles' judicial authority generally
only applies to lesser nobles and tenant commoners,

105
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:00,740
exceptions can be made
for heinous criminals who've broken a Taboo!

106
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,450
I've never cut off someone's head
with my sword before.

107
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,790
This will make me even more powerful!

108
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,710
Disciple Eugeo...

109
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,300
No, heinous criminal Eugeo!

110
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,260
I, Raios Antinous, a third-rank nobleman's heir,
in accordance with the nobles' judicial authority,

111
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,510
shall now execute you!

112
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,530
Kirito.

113
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,490
Put away your sword, Raios!

114
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,450
I won't let you hurt Eugeo!

115
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,620
So you finally showed up, Disciple Kirito?

116
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,580
However, you're a bit too late.

117
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,670
That country bumpkin there is a heinous criminal
who violated the Taboo Index!

118
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,710
No, you stand back and watch.

119
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:07,510
Just like those flowers that day,
witness this criminal's head being cut off!

120
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,140
I don't care about your taboos and noble rights!

121
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,600
Eugeo's my friend.

122
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,770
And you...

123
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,060
are scum lower than the goblins
from the land of darkness!

124
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,660
To think that two country bumpkins
would commit such grave crimes.

125
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,040
This means I can get rid of you both
at the same time.

126
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:38,670
What a wonderful day!
Surely this is the guidance of Stacia!

127
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,310
It's fine.

128
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,200
My secret skill will demolish that piece of junk!

129
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,410
Come on then, Raios!

130
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,520
How's that? How's that?

131
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:45,190
As if I, Raios Antinous, would fail to keep up
with a mere commoner like you!

132
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:51,740
Kirito.

133
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:23,860
Arms! My arms are...
bleeding... They're bleeding!

134
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,530
Humbert!

135
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,280
Bleeding... Stop my bleeding!

136
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,240
Untie your rope, and bind my arms instead!

137
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,830
No!

138
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,870
U-Untying it will reduce my life!

139
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,790
That order is a violation of the Taboo Index!

140
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,500
Taboo? But...

141
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,670
My blood is... Humbert!

142
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,760
You... Taboo...

143
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,930
But... My life will...

144
00:15:55,050 --> 00:16:01,560
Taboo... Life... Blood! Taboo!

145
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:12,950
Life... Blood... Taboo...
Life... Taboo... Life... Taboo...

146
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,820
Life...

147
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,330
Use this to stop the bleeding.

148
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,830
Life... Taboo... Life... Taboo...

149
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,610
<i>What was that?</i>

150
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,650
<i>Did something happen to the Fluctlight?</i>

151
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,320
Lord Raios is...

152
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,330
He's... He's... You... You...

153
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,290
Murderer! Monster!

154
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,630
I'm sorry.

155
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,970
I'm sorry, Eugeo-senpai!

156
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,520
It's... It's all my fault!

157
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,020
No, it's not. You're not to blame.

158
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:30,190
I... It's because I didn't think it through.

159
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,860
You're not responsible.

160
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,820
B-But...

161
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,820
But...

162
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:39,410
It's all right. After all, you and Ronie are safe.

163
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,330
I'm the one who should apologize.

164
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,290
Sorry. For subjecting you to such a horror.

165
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,240
<i>I've seen this before.</i>

166
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,610
<i>Somewhere, long ago, I saw this before.</i>

167
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,240
Don't let Tiese and Ronie hear this!

168
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,080
<i>Singular unit detected.</i>

169
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,040
<i>Tracing ID.</i>

170
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,290
<i>Coordinates fixed.</i>

171
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,250
<i>Report complete.</i>

172
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,190
<i>Murderer! Monster!</i>

173
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,940
Now I'm just like those goblins.

174
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,160
You're a human, Eugeo. Just like me.

175
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,460
Every time you make a mistake,
you continue to struggle to find its meaning.

176
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,170
You're a human.

177
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,920
Kirito.

178
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,290
Come out.

179
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,050
Come closer.

180
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,310
System Call. Generate Luminous Element.

181
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,020
Reconstruct Lost Organ.

182
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,530
Try to open your eye.

183
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,240
Yes.

184
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,870
Thank you very much, Ms. Azurica!

185
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:39,340
No, actually, Disciple Eugeo and Disciple Kirito,
I need to hand you over to your escort.

186
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,300
Before that, I'll say only this.

187
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,720
Disciple Eugeo.

188
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,390
You've broken a seal I was never able to break.

189
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:53,560
Therefore, you should be able to go
where I was never able to go.

190
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,230
Believe in that sword, and in your friend.

191
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,980
Disciple Kirito.

192
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:04,660
I was never able to get to know
who you really are.

193
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,040
Nevertheless, when you reach that tower,
something will definitely happen.

194
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:15,830
I'll be here, praying that you'll find the light.

195
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,920
Forever.

196
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:48,030
<i>I've seen this combination
of blue and gold before somewhere.</i>

197
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:54,000
I am the overseer of the capital city of Centoria,
an Integrity Knight of the Axiom Church...

198
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,880
Alice Synthesis Thirty.

199
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,560
Next time: Central Cathedral.
