1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,480
Alice?

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,480
Alice, is that you?

3
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,710
Eugeo!

4
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,710
Watch what you say and do.

5
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:33,010
I'm authorized to decrease your lives
by 70 percent.

6
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,010
The next time you try to touch me without permission,
I will cut off your hand.

7
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,310
Alice...

8
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,600
So that knight's the Alice
you've been searching for?

9
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,520
Let's do as she says.
Even if it's as criminals,

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,860
as long as we get inside the Central Cathedral,
we should understand the situation a little better.

11
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,780
Come with me.

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,830
Elite Disciple Eugeo. Elite Disciple Kirito.

13
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,160
For running afoul of the Taboo Index,

14
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,500
I shall apprehend you, take you into custody
and, after questioning,

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,290
I shall execute you.

16
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,010
Central Cathedral

17
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,620
Tiese!

18
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,780
Ronie!

19
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,590
L-Lady Knight! W-We have a request!

20
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,720
Please grant us permission
to return these swords to our senpais!

21
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,140
Fine. However,
I cannot allow criminals to carry swords.

22
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,600
I'll hold onto them.

23
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,900
If you wish to speak with them,
I'll allow one minute.

24
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,320
Eugeo-senpai!

25
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,790
Eugeo-senpai, I'm so sorry.
This is... this is my fault...

26
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,540
because I did something so foolish.

27
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,170
You didn't. You're wrong.

28
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,840
You're not to blame.

29
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,130
You did the right thing for your friend.

30
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,510
It's my fault that this happened.

31
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,800
You have nothing to be sorry about.

32
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,770
This time, I'm going to save you!

33
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:16,060
I'll work hard to become an Integrity Knight,
and then I'll save you!

34
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,570
So please, wait for me, all right?

35
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,190
I promise... I promise!

36
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,030
Um... this is your lunch.

37
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,500
Please have it when you get hungry.

38
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,500
Tha—

39
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,050
Time's up. Step away.

40
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,550
July 6, 2026 7:15AM  Ocean Turtle

41
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,690
If only I could dive into the Underworld
and rescue you...

42
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,840
Excuse me.

43
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,430
A-A robot?

44
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,330
Hey!

45
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,080
Stop that, Ichiemon!

46
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,000
M-Mr. Higa... what is this?

47
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,510
Uh, well... it's Ichiemon, 'kay?

48
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,720
Its full name is
Electroactive Muscled Operative Machine.

49
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,850
EMOM for short.

50
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,560
I added "Ichi" as in the number one, so...

51
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,430
Ichiemon, 'kay?

52
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,270
So what is this Ichiemon doing here, exactly?

53
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,230
Well, actually—

54
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:07,360
Higa's making me help him tune the program.

55
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,070
Even though we're not colleagues
in a college seminar anymore.

56
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,110
Ms. Rinko!

57
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,330
Good morning, Ms. Asuna.

58
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,370
Just as we thought,
the balancer's processing speed is the bottleneck.

59
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,540
You have the budget, don't you?

60
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,630
Can't you use a faster chip?

61
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,840
If you factor in the exhaust heat
and battery consumption,

62
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,340
this is the best I can do for its mind, 'kay?

63
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,720
The only option is to curb it
by tuning the EAP actuator.

64
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,100
Those polymer muscles are last generation.

65
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,150
Why don't you use CNT?
Doing that will make it lighter, am I right?

66
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,860
I'm sorry, Asuna, for being so rowdy.

67
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,070
It's fine.

68
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,280
I'm sure Kirito likes it better
when it's lively around him.

69
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,620
We're building this thing
at the old guy's request, too, 'kay?

70
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,750
Mr. Kikuoka? Why would he...

71
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,840
I don't have any idea how serious he is, either.

72
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,590
If we're going to invite Fluctlights
raised in the Underworld here,

73
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,720
he says they're going to need bodies
they can operate as well.

74
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,350
Then you mean this robot
is being built to house an AI?

75
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,940
No way. We're definitely not
housing it in this thing, 'kay?

76
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,860
Other than Ichiemon, we have a second unit
designed for an AI to test-pilot.

77
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,440
And it functions way better, 'kay?

78
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,480
A second unit?

79
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,360
And what would its name be?

80
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,870
Niemon, 'kay?

81
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,200
'Kay— No, I mean... is that so?

82
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,830
By the way, why would it function better
if it's piloted by an AI?

83
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,630
The human brain adjusts balance on its own.

84
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,470
When you attempt
to replicate that system mechanically,

85
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,100
the body will balloon in size no matter what.

86
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,890
So if its mind is an artificial Fluctlight,

87
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,810
the auto-balancer would perform
just like a human's.

88
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:12,400
Yes! And if that happens,
we can create a near-perfect humanoid body.

89
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,940
Or so we hope.

90
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,410
But it's still just a pipe dream.

91
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:22,910
But Niemon back at the development department
looks pretty human, or at least its silhouette does.

92
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,120
If you're going to be so proud of it,
show it to me, alread—

93
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,790
This Niemon still can't walk autonomously yet, can it?

94
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,460
Well, of course not, 'kay?

95
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,470
It may have a CPU loaded,
but the control program itself is empty.

96
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,470
I see.

97
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,060
Ms. Asuna?

98
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,270
Are you going to have breakfast now?

99
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,140
Oh, yes.

100
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,770
Then let's go down to the cafeteria together.

101
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,440
Since it seems like
Higa will be eating here with Ichiemon.

102
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,570
Take your time, 'kay?

103
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,000
See you later.

104
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,690
What's the matter, Asuna?

105
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,230
No, it's nothing!

106
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:31,940
Okay.

107
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,790
May 25, 380 in the time of the realm of humanity
Central Cathedral  Underground Prison

108
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,630
I think it's been about a day and a half
since we were put in here.

109
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,800
So? Feeling a little calmer now?

110
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,720
Somehow, it all seems like a dream.

111
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,970
Me slicing off Humbert's arm...

112
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,480
Not to mention Raios ending up like that.

113
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,730
Don't think too much on it.

114
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,060
Right now, you should be thinking about
what happens next.

115
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,820
What happens next?

116
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,570
You're absolutely right, Kirito.

117
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,450
We have to break out of this cell somehow,
and find out what happened to Alice.

118
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:31,620
Yeah. There has to be a way out of here.

119
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,750
I wonder if Alice was locked up in here, too,
eight years ago?

120
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,630
I wonder. Maybe?

121
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,840
Hey, Eugeo. I just want to make sure, okay?

122
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,270
That Integrity Knight
who called herself Alice Synthesis Thirty,

123
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,390
there's no question
that she's the Alice you've been searching for?

124
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,650
That voice... that golden hair
and those deep blue eyes...

125
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,650
I could never forget them.

126
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,740
She just seemed like a totally different person.

127
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,570
For a childhood friend,
she sure didn't hold back when she clobbered you.

128
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:10,580
Does that mean her memories or mind
are being controlled somehow?

129
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,960
But I didn't find any sacred art spells like that
in the textbooks.

130
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,880
The church's higher-ranking priests
can manipulate life, right?

131
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,760
I bet they could easily control memories.

132
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,510
But if that knight really was Alice,
then what was that?

133
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,600
Two years ago, in the northern cave of Rulid...

134
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:36,520
Kirito, Eugeo, I'll be waiting for you... always.

135
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,190
At the top of the Central Cathedral.

136
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,740
I'll always be waiting for you both.

137
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,120
Yeah... you told me.

138
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,540
That when you and Selka
were trying to treat my wounds,

139
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,580
you heard a voice that sounded like Alice's.

140
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,590
Waiting at the top of the Central Cathedral, huh?

141
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,300
It's still so far away...

142
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,310
That's right, do you think
we can access our Stacia windows here?

143
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,770
We never tested that.

144
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,190
Let's try now.

145
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,060
Okay.

146
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,030
It appeared!

147
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,160
No wonder they won't budge
no matter how hard we pull on them!

148
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:38,170
To break these chains, we're going to need a weapon
or tool that's at least class 38 as well.

149
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,210
I guess you're right.

150
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:53,100
No matter how hard you search, there's only the beds,
water skins, and chains in here.

151
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,310
Only the chains...

152
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,190
No, that's not all. We have two of them.

153
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,490
These damn chains.

154
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,330
Um, Kirito...

155
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,090
You're not actually thinking
of pulling on them like this, are you?

156
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,760
That's right.

157
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,760
Since these two chains
have identical priority levels,

158
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,010
pulling on them
with our Object Authority Control over 40

159
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,020
should theoretically be the same
as them wearing down each other one's life.

160
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,850
Hold on tight, okay?

161
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,730
Ready, set...

162
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,740
All right!

163
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,700
Keep your voice down! The guard will wake up!

164
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,080
All right, let's go.

165
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,840
- Ready, set...
- Ready, set...

166
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,600
That knocked at least 100 off my life!

167
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,520
Well, isn't that a small price to pay?

168
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:20,980
Here, look.

169
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,820
Now then.

170
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,450
I'm going to ask to be sure,
but you're okay with this, right?

171
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,870
Eugeo, if we escape from this cell
and start searching for the truth about Alice,

172
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,120
we'll be directly defying the Axiom Church.

173
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:47,210
From now on, there'll be no time to feel conflicted
every time we take action.

174
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,970
If you can't prepare yourself for that now,

175
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,930
you're better off staying behind.

176
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,390
Yeah. I know.

177
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,640
But I've already made up my mind.

178
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,600
To even defy the Axiom Church,
if it means that I can go back to Rulid Village with Alice.

179
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,360
To draw my sword and fight, again and again,
if that's what it takes.

180
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,570
If that Integrity Knight is the real Alice,

181
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,320
I'm going to find out why she lost her memories,
and turn her back into who she was before.

182
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,080
That's the most important thing to me.

183
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,500
That day we went into the woods with Ronie and Tiese,
you said so yourself, Kirito.

184
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,540
That there are things we have to do
even if they're against the law.

185
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,130
I finally understand what you meant now.

186
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,420
I see.

187
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,680
Your resolve... couldn't be more clear.

188
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,280
All right. Let's make a run for it
before the guard comes.

189
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,210
I think we should be okay now.

190
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,000
Kirito, these are...

191
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,090
Wh-What? What's wrong?

192
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,050
I've never seen any before...

193
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,300
but I'm positive.

194
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,260
These are... roses, Kirito.

195
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:00,850
Roses?

196
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,520
Are you serious?

197
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,810
All of these flowers growing in this labyrinth?

198
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,440
For there to be so many precious roses here...

199
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,400
Even now, I just can't believe any of this.

200
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,110
You and I are in the Central Cathedral.

201
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:22,200
Well, not as Integrity Knights like we planned,
but as escaped prisoners.

202
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,660
But this might've been the right thing all along.

203
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,170
Since if we'd become Integrity Knights,
we might've ended up like Alice, too.

204
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:33,250
They could've controlled our memories, too, huh?

205
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,420
But if that's true of all Integrity Knights,

206
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,260
who do they think they are, I wonder?

207
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,390
I don't know.

208
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,520
In other words, even if those knights' memories
have been sealed away,

209
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,900
they should know things like who their parents are,
and where they were born, right?

210
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,070
After all, that's the fundamental root
of being human.

211
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:57,860
That's why I think it would be hard
to fake knowledge like that.

212
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:02,580
Right, those knights can easily go anywhere
in the human realm on their flying dragons.

213
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:07,000
Even if the memories of their real birthplace
were sealed away and replaced with fake ones,

214
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,290
once they actually visited their hometowns,
they'd know right away that it was a lie.

215
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,210
I see.

216
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,840
You!

217
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,890
You just realized we might find a way
to restore my memories in this tower, didn't you?

218
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,770
Uh, n-no, I...

219
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,850
Come on now!

220
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,820
Wha— Stop that, Kirito!

221
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,860
You're still such a worrywart! I told you.

222
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:43,320
Whether I get my memories back or not,
I'll be with you on this journey till the end.

223
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,830
Don't treat me like a kid.

224
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,790
It's not like I'm doubting your word.

225
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,710
I mean, you've said it so many times.

226
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:59,340
But when I think about how our journey
might be coming to an end, somehow...

227
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,430
If it's going to end anyway,
let's make it a happy... no...

228
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,180
Let's end it on a blissful note.

229
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,190
You're going to restore Alice's memories,
and go home to Rulid with her.

230
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,690
Hey, but in that case,
you'll have to choose another Calling, right?

231
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,740
You should start thinking about that now.
Since the next one might last the rest of your life.

232
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,410
I think you're getting ahead of yourself.

233
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,910
Well, but either way,
I've had it with being a woodcutter!

234
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,870
I don't doubt it!

235
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,370
All right, let's go.

236
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,180
As expected.

237
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,470
My mentor, Lady Alice is very perceptive.

238
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:55,940
After all, she predicted the very unlikely escape
of our prisoners.

239
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,270
"My mentor"?

240
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:03,240
Anticipating that you would break out,
I was ordered to spend the night here.

241
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:08,200
To be honest, I was extremely skeptical,
but for you to really show up...

242
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,290
An Integrity Knight!

243
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,630
Lady Alice? "My mentor"?

244
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:22,550
Needless to say, I will be sending you back
to the underground prison,

245
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,180
but first, it looks like
I'll have to administer some harsh punishment.

246
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,890
I'm sure you two are prepared for that.

247
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:36,350
Then you must also be prepared for us
not to take that punishment without a fight, right?

248
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,860
So spirited!

249
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,200
Out of respect for your bravado,
I shall tell you my name.

250
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,870
I am Integrity Knight Eldrie Synthesis Thirty-One.

251
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,830
As I was summoned a mere month ago,

252
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,790
I am just a novice,
without my own territory...

253
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,010
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to forgive that?

254
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:39,310
Next time: The Sage of the Library.
