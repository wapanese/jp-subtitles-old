1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:09,230
<i>Under the rule of the absolute Administrator,
this world entered a long period of peace and idleness.</i>

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,450
<i>But 70 years after Quinella became Administrator,</i>

3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,370
<i>she became aware
that she had undergone some kind of change.</i>

4
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:31,960
<i>To her astonishment, her soul's capacity
for preserving her memories had reached its limit.</i>

5
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:39,390
<i>But this only drove her to come up
with yet another demonic solution.</i>

6
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,850
I appreciate your coming here.

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,190
Now, this way.

8
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,770
Yes, ma'am.

9
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:55,280
<i>If I can copy my own Fluctlight's thoughts
and memories by overwriting this child's Fluctlight...</i>

10
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,910
Close your eyes.

11
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,750
<i>And so Administrator,
through this diabolical ceremony...</i>

12
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,420
<i>the Synthesis Ritual, a secret technique
signifying the fusing of soul and memory,</i>

13
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,420
<i>finally succeeded in seizing control
of another's Fluctlight.</i>

14
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:21,140
<i>But that ended up being Administrator's...
no, Quinella's mistake.</i>

15
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,470
Mistake?

16
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,020
That's right.

17
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,770
Because after she'd taken over the young girl,
for the split second that she disposed of her previous self,

18
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:34,110
she and the girl had become
two gods wielding equal authority.

19
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,820
Kirito, you're familiar with my original version,
are you not?

20
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,330
Tell me the features of the Cardinal System.

21
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,250
Um...

22
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,710
To operate over an extended period of time
without any adjustments or maintenance by humans?

23
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,090
Correct.

24
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:57,630
To achieve that, the Cardinal System
has two core programs, a main and sub.

25
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,970
While the main process performs balance controls...

26
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,470
The subprocess does an error-check of the main.

27
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,100
That's right.

28
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:12,900
<i>It wasn't just the preservation of order
Quinella had etched into her own Fluctlight.</i>

29
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,900
Deep inside her soul,
I had this thought as her subprocess...

30
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,410
"I must correct this woman's errors."

31
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,670
<i>I... I steadfastly waited for that moment.</i>

32
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,790
<i>For 70 long years!</i>

33
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,970
Ruler and Mediator

34
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,440
And now, this child's Fluctlight is mine.

35
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,820
System Call.

36
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,240
Generate Luminous Element.

37
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,740
Lightning Shape.

38
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,900
Discharge!

39
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,320
What?

40
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,780
System Call!

41
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,410
Generate Luminous Element!

42
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,790
System Call! Generate Umbra Element. Ball Shape!

43
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,250
- Discharge!
- Discharge!

44
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,050
System Call! Redefinition Object!

45
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,470
Sword Class!

46
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,100
System Call. Redefinition Object! Rod Class!

47
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,610
System Call! Change Field Attribution!

48
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,230
<i>Impossible.</i>

49
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,860
<i>She made this a restricted area
for System Commands?</i>

50
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,050
<i>I can't defeat her in this body.</i>

51
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,190
System Call! Generate Aerial Element!

52
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,900
Stream Shape!

53
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:49,030
<i>There are just two locations in this world
that even Administrator can't control.</i>

54
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,410
<i>One is the other side of the End Mountains.</i>

55
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,290
<i>And the other is...</i>

56
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,500
System Call!

57
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,380
Generate Blizzard Gate... Zero One!

58
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,260
<i>...the Great Library!</i>

59
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,220
<i>In that instant, this place was completely isolated
from the outside world.</i>

60
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,400
In the 200 years since, I immersed myself
in nothing but observation and deliberation,

61
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:24,480
working on a plan that would allow me
to strike back against Administrator.

62
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:33,370
But she anticipated my ambush
and assembled a retinue of loyal and powerful followers.

63
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,080
<i>Through the Synthesis Ritual,
this man will be reborn.</i>

64
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:44,710
<i>As the ultimate warrior,
a Integrity Knight swearing absolute fealty!</i>

65
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,760
<i>The first to become an Integrity Knight</i>

66
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,930
<i>was a true hero known as an extraordinary swordsman
who hated the church's rule,</i>

67
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:58,930
<i>who, with his comrades, made his way
to a remote region and founded his own village.</i>

68
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,310
<i>The name of that knight was Bercouli Synthesis One.</i>

69
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,990
Administrator and I are nearly on equal footing
in one-on-one combat.

70
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:16,620
But with the situation changed,
it became clear that I also needed a collaborator.

71
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:21,370
I tried to find that collaborator, no matter the risk.

72
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,130
Each time, I would open a door
as far away as possible,

73
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:30,090
I would cast Sensory Sharing and other arts
onto the nearby birds and insects,

74
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,970
and release them all over the world.

75
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,060
See.

76
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,350
Her name is Charlotte.

77
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:47,650
She's been observing the two of you
ever since you left Rulid Village.

78
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,530
From time to time, she did more than just watch.

79
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,620
<i>She guided us when we were running
from the Integrity Knight?</i>

80
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,540
Th-That's right!

81
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,290
When all my zephilia buds were cut off,
was it you who encouraged me?

82
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:12,930
Charlotte's the most ancient of the observation units
that I enchanted and released into the world.

83
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,890
Her long, long mission
is finally coming to an end, now, eh?

84
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:24,190
Since I froze the degradation of her life,
I've had her working for me for more than 200 years.

85
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,560
<i>Thank you.</i>

86
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:35,610
So you've been searching for a human collaborator
while barricaded in this Great Library for over 200 years?

87
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:42,580
Indeed. But as I observed this world,
even I couldn't figure it out.

88
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:51,260
Why would the gods of the outside world turn a blind eye
to the tyranny of this fake god, Administrator?

89
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,220
As I pondered, and referred to the database
stored inside the Cardinal System,

90
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,680
I arrived at one conclusion.

91
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:08,150
That the true god, Rath, doesn't wish
for the people of this world to lead happy lives.

92
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,150
Quite the opposite, in fact.

93
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:18,740
They're observing how the people will resist
as they slowly tighten a vise about them.

94
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,990
That load is increasing by the day,

95
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:27,630
until eventually, the greatest trial of all,
the final phase of the load test will arrive.

96
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,830
Final phase?

97
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,300
You know it well yourself...
what lies outside the realm of humanity.

98
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,880
The Dark Territory.

99
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:43,560
Correct. That world of darkness was created
to subject the people to the ultimate agony.

100
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:52,820
The monsters who have Fluctlights like humans,
except for their greater impulse to slaughter and plunder.

101
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,490
They can hardly wait to invade the realm of humanity,
and commit atrocity upon atrocity.

102
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,120
Most likely, that day isn't too far off.

103
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,700
Is Administrator aware of that?

104
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,580
She underestimates the forces of darkness,

105
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,790
convinced that she and her Integrity Knights alone
can repulse them.

106
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:17,130
She even had the guardian dragons
of the north, south, east, and west slain,

107
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:21,470
despite their valuable fighting power,
because she couldn't exert control over them.

108
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:26,730
But it's not possible for them
to defeat the forces of darkness on their own.

109
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,350
Their overall numbers are too few.

110
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,940
But doesn't that mean
that whether or not you defeat Administrator,

111
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,440
the path this world is destined to take
will stay the same?

112
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,530
That's correct.

113
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:45,870
At this point, I have no way of stopping the invasion
from the Dark Territory.

114
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,960
In other words, once you've attained your objective,

115
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,500
you couldn't care less
what happens to this world afterwards?

116
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,960
Is that what you're saying? Cardinal?

117
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,630
Perhaps I am.

118
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,140
However, I...

119
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,220
For having engineered the end of the world...

120
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,600
I will never accept a god like Rath!

121
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:13,230
Therefore, I arrived at the only possible conclusion.

122
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,030
That I would return the Underworld, both
the human realm and the Dark Territory, to nothingness.

123
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,280
Return it... to nothingness?

124
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,620
Just what I said.

125
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,660
I'm going to delete every Fluctlight
stored in the Lightcube Cluster.

126
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:35,090
Of every last resident of both
the realms of humanity and darkness.

127
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,800
Kirito.

128
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:44,260
If, with your help, I'm able to eliminate Administrator,
and regain all my authority,

129
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:48,520
then, before I extinguish this world,
I'll grant you a wish, to a degree.

130
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:53,560
If there are people you'd like to save,

131
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,110
I won't delete their Fluctlights,
and leave them archived instead.

132
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,610
I believe it should be possible,
after you've escaped to the outside world,

133
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,870
for you to secure the Lightcubes of ten or so.

134
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,370
I... I...

135
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,210
Cardinal.

136
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,510
You just told me that your soul
was a copy of Quinella's, right?

137
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:24,590
Then that means that the pure blood of the nobles
flows in your veins as well.

138
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,680
The genes of those
who seek their own profit and desires.

139
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,770
So why didn't you abandon everything
and try to escape?

140
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,570
Why would you continue to wait alone
in a place like this for 200 years?

141
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:46,280
For me, as the Cardinal subprocess,
all profit and all desires amount to just one thing.

142
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:50,450
Eliminating Administrator and normalizing the world.

143
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:58,210
In my eyes, a normalized world is no longer possible
unless it's returned to complete nothingness.

144
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,630
Therefore... Therefore, I...

145
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,970
No, perhaps I'm wrong.

146
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,390
Even I have a desire. Just one...

147
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:11,930
In the last 200 years,
there was something I was desperate to know.

148
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,730
Hey, Kirito. Stand up, too.

149
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,700
That should do it.

150
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,040
Hey, Kirito, come over here.

151
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,710
Come closer.

152
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,080
No complaining.

153
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,090
Raise both arms.

154
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,170
Like this?

155
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,590
Hold them in front of you and make a circle.

156
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,720
Really! Do I have to spell it out for you?

157
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,770
I see. So this is...

158
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,240
This is what it means to be human, huh?

159
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,120
So warm.

160
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:16,080
At last, I feel rewarded.

161
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,130
Those 200 years I spent weren't in vain.

162
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,420
Just discovering this warmth
is enough to satisfy me.

163
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,260
I feel rewarded... more than enough.

164
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,190
How long are you planning to stand there in a daze?

165
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,900
No way.

166
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,740
So? Have you made a decision?

167
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,530
Are you going to accept my proposal, or reject it?

168
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,490
All right.

169
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:59,160
I'll take part in your plan. But...

170
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,920
But I'm not going to stop thinking about it.

171
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,550
I'm going to keep searching for a way.

172
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:11,510
A solution to somehow avoid tragedy
and allow this world to survive peacefully.

173
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,260
Geez, what an absurdly optimistic person you are.

174
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,640
After all, I don't want you to disappear, either.

175
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:26,570
When you tell me to pick ten people,
you'll definitely be among them.

176
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,990
And you're also a fool.

177
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,620
Who's going to extinguish this world if I escape?

178
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:41,040
Hey, I'm just saying that I understand the situation,
but I won't give up on struggling in vain!

179
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:48,300
One day, you too will know the bitterness of giving up.

180
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,260
Not of coming up short
after giving your all,

181
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:57,810
but of being forced
to accept the likelihood that you'll fail.

182
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,320
Thanks for waiting!

183
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,780
Sorry we left you on your own.

184
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,160
Kirito! And also, um...

185
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:20,330
Yeah, this person, Cardinal was banished
by the current pontifex, Administrator,

186
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,410
and she used to be another pontifex.

187
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,960
Pontifex?

188
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:28,000
She's going to help us fight the Integrity Knights.

189
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,260
H-Help?

190
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:36,600
Yeah, she has a goal to defeat Administrator
and regain her status as pontifex.

191
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,470
So... well, I guess that means we're joining forces.

192
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,980
Indeed.

193
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,690
Then do you know if Alice...
the Integrity Knight, Alice Synthesis Thirty,

194
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:50,820
is the same person
as Alice Zuberg from Rulid?

195
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:56,570
I'm sorry, but the information I can access here
is extremely limited.

196
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:01,790
I do know that an Integrity Knight named Alice
was indeed born, but...

197
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:08,000
However, what I can do is tell you how to reverse
the Synthesis Ritual for producing Integrity Knights.

198
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,630
How do we do that?

199
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:14,760
Simply remove the Piety Module
embedded in their foreheads.

200
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,220
It looks like a triangular prism.

201
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,220
Like the one we saw...

202
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:25,520
The Piety Module is inserted in a way
that blocks links to memories.

203
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,190
This seals away the past
of the person becoming an Integrity Knight,

204
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:34,700
while simultaneously forcing absolute fealty
to the Axiom Church and the pontifex.

205
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:40,660
In other words, to break the spell we have to
jog the Integrity Knight's memories of their past, huh?

206
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,870
That alone wouldn't be enough.

207
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,790
There's one more thing that's absolutely necessary.

208
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,880
Wh-What's that?

209
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:52,710
What originally existed
where the module's been embedded.

210
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:58,010
In other words, the memory fragment
most valued by the Integrity Knight.

211
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,470
Administrator's a cautious woman.

212
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:07,230
The memory fragments extracted from these knights
are without a doubt stored in her chambers...

213
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,770
on the top floor of the Central Cathedral.

214
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:12,610
You mean...

215
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,990
to restore an Integrity Knight to their former state,
we'll need the stolen memory fragment.

216
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:22,740
But to get our hands on it,
we'll have to breach the knights' defenses

217
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,830
and somehow make our way to the top floor
where Administrator is.

218
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:32,920
Don't be so naive as to think you can
defeat an Integrity Knight without killing them.

219
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:39,680
The most I can do for you is to provide you
with equipment equal to that of the Integrity Knights.

220
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,470
The rest depends on
whether you're able to fight your best.

221
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,560
But what if Alice is the one who shows up?

222
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,690
I can't bring myself to fight her.

223
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,400
I came all this way to get Alice back!

224
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,240
Indeed. You have a point.

225
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,240
Eugeo, I understand your goal.

226
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:09,040
Fine. Should Integrity Knight Alice be the one
standing in your way, then use this.

227
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,880
What is it?

228
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:17,880
Whoever is stabbed with this dagger will be linked to me
by an inseverable connection.

229
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,350
Meaning that any sacred arts I use
will affect her without fail.

230
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:29,560
Eugeo, use this to stab anywhere
on Integrity Knight Alice's body.

231
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:33,940
In that instant, I'll send Alice into a deep sleep
using my sacred arts.

232
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:39,610
Until you've regained her memories
and are prepared to remove the Synthesis.

233
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:45,030
Understood.
If I can't talk sense into Alice, I'll use this.

234
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,460
I originally created it to use against Administrator,

235
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:55,290
and kept another one as a spare, but well...
if you can succeed on your first try, it should be fine.

236
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,510
That's a huge responsibility.

237
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,590
What you just said, "equipment equal to that
of the Integrity Knights," did you mean...

238
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,350
You and Eugeo have your own powerful swords,
don't you?

239
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,390
I'm going to help you get them back.

240
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:14,230
You mean my Blue Rose Sword
and Kirito's black one?

241
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:21,400
I'm quite certain that your swords are being stored
in the armory on the third floor of the cathedral.

242
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,120
By the way,
what floor are Administrator's chambers on?

243
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:30,160
The Central Cathedral grows by the year, so...

244
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,120
it should've reached 100 floors by now.

245
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,300
Unfortunately, there's one more thing you need to do.

246
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,210
Wh-What is it?

247
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,630
I know you two have powerful swords,

248
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,720
but that alone won't be enough
to bring down the Integrity Knights.

249
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,980
That's because they have the terrifying technique
of amplifying their weapons' abilities multiple times.

250
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,690
Do you mean the Perfect Weapon Control Art?

251
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:02,650
Weapons of the Divine Object class take on
the properties of the object they're fashioned from.

252
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,280
By fully releasing a weapon's memories,
so to speak,

253
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:12,620
the Perfect Control Art realizes offensive powers
more potent than normally possible.

254
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,830
Both of you close your eyes and think of your sword.

255
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,370
All right, that's enough.

256
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,840
There.

257
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,880
Memorize that thoroughly.

258
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,190
Eugeo... and Kirito.

259
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,110
The fate of the world rests on you.

260
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,030
Whether it's engulfed in hellfire,
or sinks into nothingness.

261
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,240
Or perhaps you'll find a third path.

262
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,580
I've told you all that I can tell,

263
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,870
and given you all that I can give.

264
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,250
All you have to do now
is follow the path you believe in.

265
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,710
Thank you very much, Ms. Cardinal.

266
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,960
I'll definitely get to the top of the cathedral

267
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,220
and restore Alice back to who she was.

268
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,600
Now...

269
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,020
Go!

270
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,270
Next time: The Crimson Knight.
