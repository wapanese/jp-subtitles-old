1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:04,400
I'm starting to get annoyed.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,270
Why do you flail about
in this unseemly manner?

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,530
The outcome of this battle is already clear.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,910
What meaning can there be
in the process of reaching a set outcome?

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,830
It's the process that matters.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,500
Whether you die on your hands and knees,
or die gripping your sword.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,960
It's what makes us human.

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,510
The way you're dressed all in black
makes you look like a dark knight.

9
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:47,020
Fine. If you wish to suffer, then I'll make sure
your fate is drawn out and cruel.

10
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,730
You'll beg me to put you out of your misery.

11
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,820
That won't be enough...

12
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,030
...to make up for my stupidity.

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
My Hero

14
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,920
<i>The High-Norkian style stance.</i>

15
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,840
<i>Which means she'll try for a killing blow.</i>

16
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:07,620
That was the one-handed four-hit strike sword skill,
Vertical Square, wasn't it?

17
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,120
<i>Sword skill? Did she really just say that?</i>

18
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,000
<i>Did she pull that from Eugeo's memories?</i>

19
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,920
<i>If that's the case,</i>

20
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,470
<i>then if I unleash a skill I never showed Eugeo
with more than four hits...</i>

21
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,070
That was the six-hit rapier skill Crucifixion.

22
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,150
No way.

23
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,750
Single-hit katana skill Zekkuu.

24
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:07,470
There's nothing I don't know
about the system driving this world.

25
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,470
That's...

26
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,640
This isn't like you.

27
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,600
Eugeo.

28
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,400
Kirito.

29
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,990
It wasn't just the Integrity Knights
who lost their memories.

30
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,660
You and I have both
forgotten something important.

31
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:38,380
You, me and Alice were born in Rulid Village
and grew up together.

32
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,010
Yeah, I just remembered that, too.

33
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,590
I was also there
when Alice was taken away by that knight.

34
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,510
I couldn't do anything that day.

35
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,310
You were just a kid, but you gathered your courage
and tried to stand up to that Integrity Knight.

36
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,520
Eugeo.

37
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,610
So this time, I'm going to give you a push.

38
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,450
This time, let's definitely save Alice together.
Now, Kirito...

39
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,040
Now, Kirito...

40
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,420
Kirito.

41
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,590
I know you can stand again.

42
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,800
You can stand as many times as it takes.

43
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,440
Now stand, Kirito.

44
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,990
My best friend.

45
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,910
My...

46
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,450
hero.

47
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,260
Yeah, I'll stand.
For your sake, as many times as it takes.

48
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,020
Why?

49
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,730
Why do you resist fate like a fool?

50
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,190
That's why.

51
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,820
Resisiting is the only reason I'm here right now!

52
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,660
This world is mine!

53
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,620
I will never allow such behavior
from an uninvited intruder!

54
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:36,830
On your knees!

55
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,750
Offer me your head!

56
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,710
Submit to me!

57
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,340
Wrong.

58
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,260
You're just a usurper.

59
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:55,390
Someone who doesn't love this world
or the people who live in it,

60
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,890
has no right to be its ruler!

61
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,440
To love is to control.

62
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,150
I love everything.

63
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,030
I rule everything!

64
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,060
Such insolence!

65
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,150
Such insolence!

66
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,890
Curse you!

67
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,610
Not yet.

68
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,080
Not yet!

69
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:10,690
To think that
neither of your swords were metal...

70
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,660
How unexpected.
What an unexpected outcome.

71
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:26,330
I've suffered too many injuries to heal,
even if I gather the remaining resources here.

72
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,750
Now that it's come to this,
I have no choice.

73
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,300
Wh-What are you...

74
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:44,810
Wha—

75
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,770
This is earlier than planned, but...

76
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,190
I'll be going now.

77
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,120
Goodbye, boy.

78
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,000
Until we meet again.

79
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,330
Next time...

80
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,960
...in your world.

81
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,300
Wait!

82
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,140
Your Eminence!

83
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,140
Please take me with you!

84
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:35,690
Let go! Let go of me! You ill-bred swine!

85
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:41,070
At last... at last I can be one with Your Eminence!

86
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,740
Not by a revolting clown like you!

87
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,950
Oh, Your Eminence!

88
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:53,790
My Lady Administrator!

89
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:18,990
I... this world of mine...

90
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,250
Is it over now?

91
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,590
Eugeo.

92
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,900
Stop! Stop already!

93
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,270
Why won't it work? Eugeo.

94
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,400
Come back! Eugeo!

95
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,160
Stay cool... Kirito.

96
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,580
Eugeo! Hold on, I'll heal you now, okay?

97
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:21,010
It’s fine. It's fine this way, Kirito.

98
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,430
What are you talking about?
How is it fine?

99
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,970
If it didn't end up like this,

100
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:34,400
you and I would've had to fight
on behalf of our own Alice.

101
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:41,610
Me to get Alice's memories back, and you...

102
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,700
to save Integrity Knight Alice's soul.

103
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:52,540
Then fight!
After I've healed all your wounds, fight me!

104
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,170
You're stronger than I am now! So...

105
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,380
on behalf of your Alice, fight me!

106
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:04,180
My sword is already broken.

107
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:12,600
Not to mention, because I was weak,
I turned my sword against you.

108
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,270
I have to atone for that sin.

109
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,520
What sin? You didn't commit any sin!

110
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,030
You fought bravely the entire way!

111
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:28,030
Without you,
we never could've defeated Administrator!

112
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:32,290
So there's no need to blame yourself, Eugeo!

113
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:37,000
You think so? I hope that's true.

114
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:43,550
Kirito, I've always been envious of you.

115
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:49,260
You were stronger than anyone,
and loved by everyone.

116
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,430
Who knows, maybe even Alice... loves you...

117
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:59,980
But I finally understand.
Love isn't something you seek.

118
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,650
It's something you give.

119
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,070
Alice taught me that.

120
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,120
Your hands are idle, Kirito.

121
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,620
See, I'm almost done with mine.

122
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,500
How far along are you?

123
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,540
I'm faster than you.

124
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,710
Just this much left.

125
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,590
Then let's keep going a little longer and finish!

126
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,050
Hey, let's head back now. Or he'll find out.

127
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:36,020
We still have time.
A little longer... just a little bit, okay?

128
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,190
Guess it can't be helped.

129
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,810
All right, just a little longer, then.

130
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:41,560
Okay!

131
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,860
Done!

132
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,030
I'm done!

133
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:50,410
So this is where you've been.

134
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,910
What are you doing?

135
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,120
E-Eugeo.

136
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,130
It's three days early, but Eugeo...

137
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,460
Happy Birthday!

138
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,470
This is for me?

139
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,470
It's not like the real one your big brother has,

140
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,480
but this one's better than any wooden sword
you'll find in the shop!

141
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,870
It's amazing.

142
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,370
I’ll treasure this!

143
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,370
Thanks, you two!

144
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm so happy.

145
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,670
I've never gotten a birthday present
that made me this happy.

146
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,710
H-Hey, don't cry!

147
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,260
I'm not!

148
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,310
Wai—

149
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:06,820
The three of us
definitely lived through the same time.

150
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,280
Our paths are about to separate,
but our memories will remain forever.

151
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,410
- They'll go on living inside you.
- They'll go on living inside you.

152
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,080
- So, look...
- So, look...

153
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,710
So, look...

154
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,420
don't cry, Kirito.

155
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,920
Yeah, my memories are right here.

156
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,470
They'll be right here forever.

157
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:38,220
That's right.
So you and I will be best friends forever.

158
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:43,140
Where are you, Kirito? I can't see you.

159
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,770
I'm here. I'm right here.

160
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,480
Yeah. I see it...

161
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:55,530
Sparkling in the darkness, just like the stars.

162
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:02,410
The stars in the sky I looked up at every night
from the foot of the Gigas Cedar.

163
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,590
They look just like your sword when it shines.

164
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,880
That's it. Your black sword...

165
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,970
should be named the Night-Sky Blade.

166
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,510
Yeah, that's a great name.

167
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,930
Thanks, Eugeo.

168
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,560
This sorrowful world...

169
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,900
envelop it as gently as the night sky.

170
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,420
This is how it should be, right?

171
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,630
Yes. Let's leave the rest to those two.

172
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:57,090
I'm sure they'll guide the world
in the right direction.

173
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,550
You're right. Okay, then let's go.

174
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:01,560
Okay!

175
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,570
Performing this operation will set the
Fluctlight Acceleration rate to 1.0. Are you sure?

176
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,830
Kikuoka.

177
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,830
Can you hear me, Kikuoka?

178
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,380
Kikuoka!

179
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:20,300
<i>Lt. Colonel Kikuoka, the door has been breached.
We won't last much longer.</i>

180
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,390
<i>We're abandoning Maincon
and closing the pressure-resistant bulkhead.</i>

181
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,890
<i>Sorry, hold out for two more minutes.
We can't let them seize this place now.</i>

182
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,020
What's going on?

183
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,860
<i>Higa, isn't the lockdown done yet?</i>

184
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,070
<i>Another eight... no, seventy seconds!</i>

185
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:43,240
<i>Mr. Kiku! We're getting a call from inside!</i>

186
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,200
<i>It's...</i>

187
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,450
<i>It's him! It's Kirigaya!</i>

188
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,750
<i>Wh-What?</i>

189
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,290
<i>Kirito, is that you?</i>

190
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,890
Are you there, Kirito?

191
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,390
<i>Th-That's right!</i>

192
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,980
<i>Listen, Kikuoka! Do you...
Do you know what you've done?</i>

193
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,650
You can scold me all you want later!

194
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,610
But right now, you need to listen to me!

195
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,730
<i>What?</i>

196
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,820
<i>Hey! What's going on over there?</i>

197
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,670
Sorry, there's no time.

198
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,920
Listen, Kirito.

199
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,500
You have to look for a girl named Alice.
Then take her—

200
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,840
<i>I don't have to look for her.
She's right here!</i>

201
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,670
What did you say?

202
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,300
Son of a gun! It's a miracle!

203
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:48,180
All right. As soon as this transmission ends,
I'm going to return the FLA rate to 1,000.

204
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,930
So take Alice and head to the World’s End Altar!

205
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,480
<i>What do you mean, head to—</i>

206
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,770
Listen! Once you exit the Eastern Gate,
the Altar's due south—

207
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:57,730
Oh no!

208
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,070
They're about to infiltrate the electrical room!

209
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:03,950
What?

210
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,240
You only need to sever the power line.

211
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,870
Make sure you don't
harm the Lightcube Cluster control lines.

212
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:17,080
Leave it to me, Bro.
I wouldn't mess up like that.

213
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,420
This is bad, Mr. Kiku!

214
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,920
If they sever the main power line,
it'll cause a surge!

215
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,130
The Lightcube Cluster is protected, but...

216
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,100
the surge will hit Kirigaya's STL in Subcon!

217
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,560
His Fluctlight will get fried!

218
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,140
<i>I'll handle the lockdown procedure!</i>

219
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,440
<i>Higa, you take Dr. Kojiro and Asuna
and evacuate to the Upper Shaft.</i>

220
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,820
<i>Keep Kirito safe.</i>

221
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,940
Asuna?

222
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:46,530
<i>Asuna's there? At Rath? But why?</i>

223
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,950
<i>It's no good, they're cutting the power!
The screw propellers are going to stop!</i>

224
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,920
<i>Kirito. Kirito!</i>

225
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,840
Asuna...
