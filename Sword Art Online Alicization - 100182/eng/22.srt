1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,310
And now... and now, I...

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,070
My fighting spirit's been amplified!
I'm overflowing with energy!

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,610
To be more specific...

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,240
I am invincible!

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,700
System... Call!

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:25,120
Generate...Thermal... Element!

7
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,990
Titan of the Sword

8
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,430
I had no idea he was capable of such an art.

9
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,480
Unfortunately, I can't destroy
that intangible flame giant with my flowers.

10
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,900
If I were to focus on defense,
I couldn't hold it off for long.

11
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:58,360
Meaning we'll have to attack the real Chudelkin
in that time, huh?

12
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,700
Exactly.
I'll find a way to avert him for ten seconds.

13
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,290
Kirito, Eugeo, please take that opportunity
to attack Chudelkin.

14
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,580
But remember not to get too close.
Or else the pontifex will target you.

15
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,880
- Ten...
- ...seconds.

16
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,890
Spin, my flowers!

17
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,600
His eyes.

18
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:11,810
Got it.

19
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,390
System Call.

20
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,940
Discharge!

21
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,820
Your Eminence!

22
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,990
Please watch out!

23
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,950
This is...

24
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,440
M-My... My...

25
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,320
Eminence...

26
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,000
Kirito.

27
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,890
Well, that was a boring show,

28
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,520
but at least I was able
to gather some useful data.

29
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,940
What an eyesore.

30
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,360
How could you?

31
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,480
Irregular boy.

32
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,950
At first,
I thought I couldn't view your properties

33
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:53,990
because you're an unregistered unit
from an unofficial marriage,

34
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,370
but that's not why, is it?

35
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,920
You came from over there, didn't you?
A human from the other side...

36
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,290
Isn't that right?

37
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,510
That's right.

38
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:13,680
Even so, I've been granted the same
Authority Level as the people of this world,

39
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:20,650
so I'm nowhere near your level in that respect,
Administrator... or rather, Ms. Quinella.

40
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,400
So the little brat filled your head
with all her silly stories!

41
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,860
Well, then?

42
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,870
Tell me, boy, what was your reason
for stumbling into my world?

43
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:39,920
Ms. Quinella, in the near future,
you're going to destroy your own world.

44
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,790
I will? I'm going to destroy it?

45
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,170
That's right.

46
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:50,680
Your mistake was creating
the order of Integrity Knights

47
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,260
to counter a massive invasion
from the Dark Territory.

48
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,850
That's the reason.

49
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,520
That definitely sounds like
something that little brat would say.

50
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,940
So pitiful...

51
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:06,730
Both her, for being so desperate to expel me,
and you for taking the bait!

52
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,240
If I may, Lady Pontifex.

53
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,450
Those who were concerned
with the current order of Integrity Knights

54
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:16,330
having no hope of fending off
the coming invasion of the forces of darkness

55
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:21,000
were Knight Commander Bercouli
and Vice Commander Fanatio.

56
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,630
I share those concerns, too.

57
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:29,760
Lady Pontifex, do you have means to protect
the people if the order of the knights fall?

58
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,140
That is not all I want to ask you.

59
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,640
You've forcefully taken us from our parents,

60
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,520
from our wives and husbands,
from our brothers and sisters,

61
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,270
and sealed away our memories

62
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,980
to plant false memories of being summoned
from a non-existent heavenly realm!

63
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:54,030
Why couldn't you at least trust
in our loyalty and respect for you?

64
00:07:54,030 --> 00:08:01,790
Why would you subject our souls to such a tainted ritual
to force us to submit to your control?

65
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:10,050
I'm offended. I trusted you very much.

66
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,970
The Piety Modules I gifted you
are the proof of my love.

67
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,390
They freed you from any trifling worries or pain,

68
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,650
so you could remain beautiful dolls for all time.

69
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,320
You think that Uncle...
His Excellency Knight Commander Bercouli,

70
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,530
throughout his long 300-year tenure
as an Integrity Knight,

71
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,950
never had any worries or suffered at all?

72
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,410
Is that what you think, Lady Pontifex?

73
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:44,540
This man,
who's shown you the deepest loyalty of us all,

74
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,290
and you knew nothing
of the pain he's been carrying in his heart.

75
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,000
Is that what you're saying?

76
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,090
Of course I knew.

77
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:01,720
This isn't the first time
Bercouli brooded over such worthless issues.

78
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:08,020
You see, he brought up the same things
about a century ago.

79
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,690
So I fixed him.

80
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,450
And it wasn't just him...

81
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,990
it's all of the knights
who've been around for over a hundred years.

82
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,370
I made them forget every one
of their painful memories.

83
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,540
Don't worry, Alice,

84
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:31,250
I'm going to erase the memories
causing you such grief.

85
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,010
I'm going to turn you back into a doll
that has no need to think.

86
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:45,640
I admit that, right now, I'm feeling enough pain
and sorrow to rip my heart to shreds.

87
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,900
But this pain...

88
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,230
I don't wish to erase these feelings
I've never felt before.

89
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:01,780
Because this pain is precisely what tells me
I'm not a puppet knight, but a human being.

90
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:09,250
Lady Pontifex, I don't want your love.
I don't need you to fix me.

91
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:14,590
Sadly, it doesn't matter how you feel about it.

92
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:21,720
Once I synthesize you again,
every one of your emotions will be erased.

93
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,770
Like how you did to yourself, Ms. Quinella?

94
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,150
Hey, boy, didn't I tell you not to bring up the past?

95
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,280
If I stop, will that erase the truth?

96
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,610
Even for you,
you can't alter the past as you please.

97
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:46,450
The fact that you were born and grew up
as a human being can't ever be erased.

98
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,710
Am I wrong?

99
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:52,710
And what if it can't, boy from the other side?

100
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:57,340
As long as you're a human,
you can't possibly be a perfect entity, that's what.

101
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,220
Humans are creatures that make mistakes.

102
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:06,310
And the mistake you've committed
is beyond repair by now.

103
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,270
With the partial collapse
of the order of Integrity Knights,

104
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:14,060
if the Dark Territory's invasion starts now,
it'll wipe out the Human Empire.

105
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:19,530
But it was you who annihilated my knights.
Quite awful.

106
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:24,240
If you're the sole survivor,
then you can start over with a clean slate.

107
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,200
That might be your intention.

108
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,410
But, unfortunately,
that's not what's going to happen.

109
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:36,170
Because on the other side, there are people
who truly hold absolute authority over this world.

110
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:42,180
They'll probably think,
"Well, that was a complete failure. Let's start over."

111
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,470
And then a button will be pressed,
and everything will vanish.

112
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,520
The mountains. The rivers.

113
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,190
The towns.

114
00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:01,150
And all of the people here, including you,
will be erased in the blink of an eye.

115
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:09,790
Then what about you people
on the other side?

116
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:16,840
Are you constantly aware
that your world was created by a higher power,

117
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:23,090
and strive to do only what would please those
higher authorities, so they won't reset your world?

118
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,680
Of course you don't.

119
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,560
After all, they would create a world,
and life, for fun,

120
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:36,060
and then erase it all
when they have no more use for them.

121
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:42,280
What gives a boy from a world like that
the right to criticize my choices?

122
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,740
Well, I refuse.

123
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,740
I won't pander to those
who fancy themselves gods of creation,

124
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,410
or reduce myself to groveling
so they'll allow me to continue to exist.

125
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:58,380
The only proof of my existence
is the control I exert.

126
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,970
That desire is the one thing that motivates me
and gives me life!

127
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,470
These legs of mine
are meant only to trample over others.

128
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,760
They are not for bending at the knees!

129
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,770
Then...

130
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,270
Then does that mean
you're going to let the Human Empire be overrun,

131
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,860
and wait for annihilation, alone, on a nominal throne
as the ruler of a nation with no civilians?

132
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:29,070
I have no intention
of allowing them to reset the Underworld,

133
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,540
or of accepting the final load test.

134
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,790
I've already perfected a command
to counter that.

135
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:42,460
You should be happy.
I'm going to show it to you all before anyone else.

136
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,420
Command?

137
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:50,600
To be honest, the knights were just a stopgap.

138
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,770
The military might I truly seek
has no need for the ability to think,

139
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,940
much less memories or emotions.

140
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:04,110
They just need
to relentlessly massacre the enemies before them.

141
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:08,450
In other words, it doesn't need to be human.

142
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:16,410
Now, awaken, my faithful servant!
My soulless slaughterer!

143
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,210
Release Recollection!

144
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,550
I-Is this...

145
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,630
It can't be!

146
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,560
Discharge!

147
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,680
Impossible. Multiple weapons at the same time?

148
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:25,980
Not only that, but using Perfect Weapon Control art
of this magnitude on thirty weapons...

149
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,940
It violates the fundamental rules of the arts!

150
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,660
This is the power I've sought.

151
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:40,370
Pure offense that will continue to fight forever.

152
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,170
Its name is... let's see...

153
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,000
Why don't I call it Sword Golem?

154
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,890
A sword automaton!

155
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:03,190
Each of its swords has the Priority Level
of a Divine Object.

156
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,980
Do you think you can defeat this Sword Golem,

157
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:12,860
the ultimate weapon I've created by stretching
my precious memory capacity to the limit?

158
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,120
Now then, fight, Golem.

159
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,330
Annihilate your enemies!

160
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,450
Eu-Eugeo...

161
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,700
<i>Use your dagger, Eugeo!</i>

162
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,330
<i>Stab the floating platform in the floor!</i>

163
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,290
<i>I'll buy you some time! Hurry!</i>

164
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,840
<i>Thank goodness. He made it in time.</i>

165
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:50,270
<i>I'm happy...
that I got to fight with you at the... end...</i>

166
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,130
Kirito.

167
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,170
Who is she?

168
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,720
Cardinal.

169
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:07,140
She fought Administrator 200 hundred years ago
and was banished. She's another pontifex.

170
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,310
Don't worry, she's on our side.

171
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:13,020
She's the one who rescued Eugeo and me
and guided us here.

172
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,480
She loves this world with all her heart,
and also mourns for it.

173
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:23,570
Very well. Since she healed my wounds,
I shall trust in the warmth of her power.

174
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,960
You're so stubborn!

175
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:44,680
Didn't I release you from duty,
thank you for your hard work,

176
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,430
and order you to live as you pleased
in the corner of your favorite bookshelf?

177
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,680
Did Charlotte have a Fluctlight, too?

178
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:57,400
No. To use a phrase from your world,
she was the same as an NPC.

179
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,610
B-But... But then...

180
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:06,570
She saved me. She sacrificed herself for me.

181
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,870
How... how can that be?

182
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:13,080
This child had already lived for 200 years.

183
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:19,250
During that time, she spoke to me constantly
and watched over numerous people.

184
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,970
It's already been two years
since she attached herself to you.

185
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:29,350
Even if you have no Fluctlight
if you've spent that much time with another...

186
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:36,230
Even if her intelligence was nothing more
than accumulated input and output data,

187
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,820
it's possible for a true heart to reside there.

188
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,530
Yes, even love, in some cases.

189
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,200
Not that you'll ever understand that
as long as you live...

190
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,330
Administrator, you hollow fool!

191
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:39,270
Next time: Administrator.
