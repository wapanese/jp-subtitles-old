Kirito?

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,990
Kirito!

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,490
Five more minutes.

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,790
Kirito! I know it's our day of rest,

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,620
but you sleep too much!

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,550
Morning, Eugeo.

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,970
Morning!

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,430
It's sunny out today,
so why don't we go into town?

March 1, 380 in the time

14
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,690
Thanks a lot!

15
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,780
Delicious!

16
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,410
That's unseemly, Kirito.

17
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,000
Well, you can't beat fresh out of the oven.
You have to eat it right away.

18
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,580
Some things never change, huh, Kirito?

19
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,000
Guess not!

20
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,170
I can't believe how time flies.

21
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,170
It's already been two years
since we left Rulid, huh?

22
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:38,760
Yeah.

23
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,470
And so much happened in that time, huh?

24
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,050
Two years ago...

25
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,060
...we arrived in Zakkaria...

26
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,770
...and while living and working on a farm,

27
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,770
we honed our swordsmanship skills.

28
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,010
We won the Swordfighting Tournament,

29
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,270
and joined the Zakkaria garrison.

30
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,020
Who would've thought
that after reaching the capital,

31
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,150
we'd actually get into the Swordcraft Academy?

32
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,780
Sometimes I think I'm dreaming.

33
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,570
Come on now.

34
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,780
It's already been a year
since we moved into the dorm.

35
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,870
Shouldn't you be used to everything by now?

36
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,750
I guess so.

37
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,830
Kirito?

38
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,920
Liena-senpai!

39
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,250
What a coincidence.

40
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,880
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

41
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:05,260
Good morning. And you're... Eugeo, wasn't it?

42
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,260
Yes!

43
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,180
Don't be so nervous.

44
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,680
What brings you here today, Liena-senpai?

45
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,730
I went home,
but they asked me to pick up some things.

46
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,690
W-Would you like us to help you?

47
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,690
You'd help me?

48
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,780
But you're Golgorosso Balto's page, aren't you?

49
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,820
I'm sorry, I was out of line. Forgive me!

50
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,870
Not to mention...

51
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,370
If anything,
shouldn't my own page have offered first?

52
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,660
Well...

53
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,210
Really!

54
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,000
I appreciate the offer.

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,510
But I won't be making any big purchases,
so I'll be fine.

56
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,550
This is your day of rest, after all.
It's all right to forget about work.

57
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:50,010
Although that work
will be coming to an end soon.

58
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,310
Since we'll be graduating.

59
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,020
I wish I could've learned more from you.

60
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,980
As your mentor,
no words could make me feel more blessed.

61
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,860
I look forward to tomorrow as well!

62
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,160
I look forward to it, too!

63
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:09,830
Right.

64
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,080
Why are you so rattled?

65
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:23,760
Well, Sortiliena-senpai is so beautiful
and has such a presence, you know?

66
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,010
That's true.

67
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,970
I'm a nervous wreck
whenever we spar during training.

68
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,180
Golgorosso-senpai has a lot of drive, too.

69
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,730
I still haven't won a single point
off Golgorosso-senpai yet.

70
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,690
Me neither.

71
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,900
That power of Liena-senpai's...
To think that she's second seat in her class.

72
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,490
Makes you wonder just how strong
First-Seat Volo-senpai is.

73
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,110
Who knows?

74
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,200
I can't imagine beating those upperclassmen.

75
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,750
Can't imagine it, huh?

March 1, 380 in the time

78
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,210
Good night, Kirito.

79
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,250
Yeah, good night!

80
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,720
<i>After spending two years here,
I've learned the mechanisms of this world</i>

81
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,180
<i>can't be measured
in simple numerical terms alone.</i>

82
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:22,400
<i>The only three things visible on your status
are your life, your Object Control Authority,</i>

83
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,030
<i>and your System Control Authority.</i>

84
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,070
<i>If your Object Control Authority is low,</i>

85
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,370
<i>it hampers your ability
to even hold up a higher-class weapon.</i>

86
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,830
<i>Conversely, if your stats far surpass that class,
it feels ridiculously light.</i>

87
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,750
<i>Your System Control Authority
is related to the sacred arts.</i>

88
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,550
<i>If you're low-level, you can only use simple spells,</i>

89
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:51,510
<i>But in the same way, you can use
sophisticated spells once you level up.</i>

90
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,220
<i>That part is no different than any other game.</i>

91
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:02,690
<i>Most importantly, and it's a system
that didn't exist in SAO or ALO,</i>

92
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,690
<i>is that a mental image
can affect these parameters.</i>

93
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,530
<i>If you have the confidence, the ego to win,
your individual power is amplified many times over.</i>

94
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,040
<i>That's what makes Liena-senpai so powerful.</i>

95
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,080
<i>She's received top-notch training
in swordsmanship since she was a child.</i>

96
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,000
<i>The confidence that she won't lose.</i>

97
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,340
<i>In other words, if you can imagine yourself
to be more powerful than anyone,</i>

98
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:32,640
<i>that gives you the potential
to rewrite the laws of the world.</i>

March 7, 380 in the time

101
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,520
As expected of you, Liena-senpai.

102
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,100
You've made some progress yourself, Kirito.

103
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,310
No, I still have a long way to go.

104
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,940
Don't be so modest.

105
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,940
I know you still have some latent power
that you're hiding from me.

106
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,820
When I chose you as my page a year ago,

107
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,530
it was because I sensed a similarity
in our sword styles.

108
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:44,000
But in the last year, it's become clear
how unrefined my sword skills are.

109
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,130
You're really powerful, Liena-senpai.

110
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,050
In the end, I wasn't able
to beat you once during training.

111
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,390
Nor have I managed to defeat him
in the last two years.

112
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,600
Are you talking about
First-Seat Volo Levantein?

113
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,220
Yes.

114
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,560
To be honest,

115
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,520
whenever I face Volo, I can feel myself falter.

116
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,730
No matter how hard I train,

117
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:16,070
I just can't convince myself
that I can withstand his powerful sword.

118
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,490
Senpai...

119
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,660
However.

120
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,120
That's not why you can't defeat me.

121
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,420
There's more to the Aincrad Style
that you haven't shown me, isn't there?

122
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:33,340
I want to know everything about you as a swordsman
before I graduate the day after tomorrow.

123
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,430
<i>This wooden sword can't...</i>

124
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,430
I understand. But forgive me.

125
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,020
Could you wait for just one more day?
I promise to show you tomorrow.

126
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,440
The greatest skill I can wield.

127
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,570
Tomorrow's a day of rest.
Training is forbidden, remember?

128
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,110
I-It won't be training, though.

129
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,070
U-Um... It's your graduation gift!

130
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,910
I'm sure it's okay to give someone
a present on a day of rest, right?

131
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,580
I've never heard of
giving someone a sword skill as a gift.

132
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,880
But I'll gratefully accept it.

133
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,460
Right! It'll be my pleasure.

134
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,530
Primary Trainee Kirito has returned!

135
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,450
You've arrived 38 minutes after curfew.

136
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:45,490
My mentor, Elite Disciple Sortiliena Serlut,
told me to extend my training session.

137
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:51,250
It's a page's duty to receive the instruction
of a disciple, so very well.

138
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:56,380
But you seem to view this
as permission to break curfew, do you not?

139
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,380
N-Not at all, Ms. Azurica!

140
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,050
My only goal is to hone my sword skills
as much as I can.

141
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,890
Breaking curfew is an unintended result.

142
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,100
Mealtime is in 17 minutes.
Make sure you're not late for that.

143
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,020
You're late, Kirito!

144
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,320
Sorry! Liena-senpai gave me
a special training session.

145
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,410
Looks good!

146
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,540
I can't tell you how envious I am, Lord Raios.

147
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,420
After we toiled so hard to clean this cafeteria,

148
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,960
they get to waltz in and merely eat.

149
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,260
No, seriously, I envy them!

150
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,890
Hey, don't be like that, Humbert.

151
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:48,140
I'm sure that even those page trainees
have struggles of their own we can't even fathom.

152
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,100
I suppose you have a point.

153
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,150
The pages are at their mentors' beck and call.

154
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,110
I hear that they can't say no to anything.

155
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,110
They're an eccentric bunch
that cherry-picks commoners to be their pages.

156
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,320
They must issue the most outlandish orders!

157
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,490
Don't pay any attention to them, Kirito.

158
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,540
By the way, Kirito, how's your garden doing?

159
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,210
Better and better each day!

160
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,550
It should be ready in time for graduation.

161
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,170
Oh, yeah? I'm looking forward to it!

162
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,810
They're really thriving, huh?

163
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,810
They're already starting to bud.

164
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,230
Well, I did mess up three times to get to this point.

165
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,400
I really hope they'll bloom this time.

166
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:44,030
Giving Liena-senpai flowers you raised yourself
as a graduation gift...

167
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,860
It's surprising.

168
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,700
I know.

169
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,830
Still, even after spending two years together,

170
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,960
I had no idea you enjoyed this kind of thing.

171
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,790
Yeah. That makes two of us.

172
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,210
You never know, this could be a sign
that your memories are coming back.

173
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,760
Like, maybe you used to grow flowers
before you showed up in Rulid Village?

174
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,300
Or maybe that was your Calling?

175
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,770
Y-Yeah, could be! I'm going to get some water.

176
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,770
Hey, Kirito.

177
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,020
What will you do
if you do regain your memories?

178
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,820
What will I do?

179
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:26,950
You're training to become an Integrity Knight
to keep me company, aren't you?

180
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,990
In my quest to find Alice,
who was taken away by the Axiom Church.

181
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,250
But when you get your memories back,
you'll go home...

182
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,590
Even if I do get my memories back,
I'm not going home.

183
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,140
I was a swordsman.

184
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,140
That's the one thing I'm certain of.

185
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,390
And what swordsman wouldn't strive
to become an Integrity Knight?

186
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,690
I'm... a weak person.

187
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:04,860
If I hadn't met you, I'd probably still be
swinging that axe every day, even now.

188
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,410
Using my Calling as an excuse
to never try to leave the village.

189
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,290
The only reason I got into this academy
was because you led the way.

190
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,370
Even so...

191
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:24,170
When you said you weren't going home
even if you got your memories back...

192
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,470
it filled me with such relief.

193
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:32,810
Listen. Let me say that I couldn't have
made it to the capital on my own, either.

194
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,730
I didn't know how to get here,
and my memory's unreliable.

195
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,650
And what's more, I didn't any money.

196
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:45,530
The reason you and I have a place at this academy
is because we were together.

197
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,190
And it will stay that way.

198
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,780
We've got to stick together.

199
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,700
We can wait to struggle on our own
after we're Integrity Knights, right?

200
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,670
That's right.

201
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:07,010
And to do that, first we have to place in the top 12
on the Advancement Exam, huh?

202
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,300
Well, my sacred arts skills
are a little shaky, you know?

203
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,850
Help me with that
when we get back to our room.

204
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,560
Okay. If you want, I can spend
our day of rest tomorrow helping you.

205
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,480
Uh, tomorrow's not good.

206
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,810
Oh, that's right!

207
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,270
Right. It's the day it's going to be ready.

208
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,900
That's something to look forward to!

209
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,030
I mean, I've waited a whole year!

210
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,240
I can't wait to use it!

211
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,040
March 8 in the time of the realm of humanity
North Centoria District Seven,
in front of Sadore's Metalworking Shop

212
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:37,950
Look at this!

213
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:42,920
These black-brick grindstones
are supposed to last three years,

214
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,670
but that's six demolished in one year!

215
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,880
I'm really sorry.

216
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,840
You can only shave a sliver off that branch,
no matter how hard you try!

217
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:58,220
How much time do you think I spent
on this one sword?

218
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,640
Gigas Cedar Forest

219
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,640
March 31, 378 in the time
of the realm of humanity

220
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,440
This one branch of the Gigas Cedar is the part
that absorbed the most of Solus' blessings.

221
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,860
Take that with you.

222
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,160
When you get to the capital,

223
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,830
you should leave this branch
with a craftsman by the name of Sadore.

224
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,410
I'm sure he'll fashion a wonderful sword for you.

225
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,920
In the first place,
my Calling is that of a metalsmith, so...

226
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,130
S-So... is the sword done?

227
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,270
Young man.

228
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,310
We haven't discussed payment yet, have we?

229
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,270
Don't worry, Kirito.

230
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,730
Just in case, I brought all my money.

231
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,360
I might consider letting you have it free of charge.

232
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,830
However! That's only if
you can swing this monster, all right?

233
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:03,960
The second I was done forging this thing
into a sword, it actually got heavier.

234
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,420
A monster, is it?

235
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,220
What's wrong, Kirito?

236
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,890
No, it's nothing.

237
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,050
That was amazing, Kirito!

238
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:57,340
So a trainee from the academy
is able to swing it, huh?

239
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,930
It's a fine sword.

240
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,470
You bet it is!

241
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,560
And like I promised,

242
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,520
that sword is yours.

243
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,190
Thank you very much!

244
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,030
Okay, I'm going to take some practice swings.

245
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,440
Don't be late for dinner, all right?

246
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,400
Right!

247
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,330
<i>For some reason,
sword skills exist in this world, too.</i>

248
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,800
<i>I could only manage two-hit strikes
with my wooden practice sword.</i>

249
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,130
<i>But if I use this sword...</i>

250
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:51,230
Looks like I'll be able
to keep my promise to Liena-senpai.

251
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,280
Come to think of it, I couldn't unleash the five-hit strike,
even with the Blue Rose Sword,

252
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,440
but I wonder if this one can?

253
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,420
I guess it's no use.

254
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,050
First-Seat Levantein?

255
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,440
Please forgive me, Elite Disciple Levantein!

256
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,690
I respectfully apologize for my rudeness!

257
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,690
You're Elite Disciple Serlut's page, right?

258
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,150
Yes. I'm Primary Trainee Kirito.

259
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,900
I see.

260
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,360
Training with the sword is forbidden
on days of rest.

261
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,450
N-No, First Seat! This isn't training.

262
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:51,580
Right. I was just trying out my new sword.
I just couldn't wait until tomorrow.

263
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,050
You seemed to be quite fired up
for someone taking test swings.

264
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,470
But you're not unlike myself.

265
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,810
Trying every which way to contrive a reason
for wielding your sword, even on a day of rest.

266
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,100
I mean that you're not the only one.

267
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,270
Then...

268
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,360
Yes. I'll overlook the fact
that you were swinging your sword on a day of rest.

269
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,190
I am grateful for your generosity.

270
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,110
It's too soon to thank me, Trainee Kirito.

271
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,240
Y-Yes?

272
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:24,200
I never said that I'd forgive you for this.

273
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,160
Swordcraft Academy
Main Training Hall

274
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,710
How did word spread so fast?

275
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,130
Kirito!

276
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,090
What did you do?

277
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,050
Well...

278
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,890
No... the fact that you didn't get into any trouble
for a year is a miracle in itself.

279
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,760
As expected of my partner!

280
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,560
Lord Levantein! What's the meaning of this?

281
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,940
Your page was a bit disrespectful to me.

282
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,020
Since I didn't feel that
it warranted a serious punishment,

283
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,820
I intend to settle things
by sparring with real swords.

284
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,320
What did you say?

285
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,660
I'm sorry for worrying you, Senpai.

286
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,280
I'll be fine!

287
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,910
In fact, I'm honored to get the chance
to spar with the first seat.

288
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,000
Kirito... what are the rules of your duel?

289
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,460
Since we're using real swords,
wouldn't that be stop-short?

290
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,460
Oh, I forgot something.

291
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,090
I don't do stop-short fights.

292
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:30,060
All of my personal matches end
when one side takes the first point.

293
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,930
Kirito has never fought a match with real swords!

294
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,770
Yes. Of course, this match can't happen
without both our consent.

295
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,860
If you refuse, we'll have no choice
but to go with stop-short.

296
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,910
I'm going to let you choose, Trainee Kirito.

297
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,370
Don't do it, Kirito. Volo's powerful.
It's too dangerous.

298
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,830
I'll leave the method up to you, Lord Levantein.

299
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,710
After all, I'm the one being punished.

300
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,850
Next time: Swordsman's Pride.
