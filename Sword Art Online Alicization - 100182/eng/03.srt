1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,140
March 20, year 378 in the time
of the realm of humanity

2
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,620
Ten more minutes...

3
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,000
Maybe only five...

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,750
No. Wake up.

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,300
Sugu?

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,470
Snap out of it. It's already five-thirty.

7
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,310
You may be a guest, and a lost child of Vecta,
but you're still expected to get up on time, okay?

8
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,270
Okay.

9
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,990
The End Mountains

10
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,290
Forty... five!

11
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,090
<i>There's still a lot about this world
I don't understand,</i>

12
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:42,390
<i>and to get to the central city,
I'm definitely going to need Eugeo's help.</i>

13
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,970
<i>But to release Eugeo from his Calling...</i>

14
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,980
I guess we're going to have to
chop this tree down first?

15
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,350
What was that?

16
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,810
No, it's nothing.

17
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,440
That's it for this morning, so let's have lunch.

18
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,990
Thanks for the meal.

19
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,160
I really wish you could've tasted Alice's pie.

20
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,040
The crust was so flaky,
and there was so much filling...

21
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,420
Having it with some fresh milk,

22
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,130
I couldn't think of anything in the world
that tasted better.

23
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,170
So Alice's Calling was a baker?

24
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,550
No, it wasn't.

25
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,060
Alice was studying the sacred arts
at the church.

26
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,520
She was known as the greatest prodigy
ever born in this town,

27
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,190
and she could cast all kinds of spells
by the time she was ten.

28
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,520
Really?

29
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,900
Then what about Selka,
the girl living in the church now?

30
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,690
She's Alice's little sister.

31
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:47,540
After Alice was gone, she moved into the church
to become a nun and to study the sacred arts.

32
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,250
Come to think of it,
there were other kids there besides Selka.

33
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,170
Those kids were taken in
after they lost their parents.

34
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,220
Ever since an epidemic broke out
in the village three years ago.

35
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,380
And that's not everything.

36
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,640
All these odd things seem to be happening lately.

37
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,970
There's talk that a horde of goblins
appeared far south on the main road

38
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,190
and have been attacking
and abducting people.

39
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,140
Goblins?

40
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,310
But I think they're just rumors.

41
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:22,110
Because a Integrity Knight
would've subdued them right away.

42
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,320
They have to.

43
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,990
All Alice did was touch the ground
in the land of darkness,

44
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,830
and those goblins are much, much worse.

45
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,370
Eugeo...

46
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:38,210
Still, it's true that after the last 2 or 3 years,
there are more graves behind the church.

47
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:42,170
Isn't there a way to bring someone back to life
using the sacred arts?

48
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,670
I don't know.

49
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,090
It's not the same,

50
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:51,430
but Alice did say that there's a high-level sacred art
that can stop life from decreasing.

51
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,100
Stop life from decreasing?

52
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,110
Yeah. She was surprised to see a passage
about that spell in one of the church's ancient books.

53
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,320
I mean, apparently only the highest priests
in the Axiom Church can use it.

54
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,780
Axiom Church?

55
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,820
The big shots in the central city
who wrote the Taboo Index.

56
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:14,370
In other words, it's not like anyone can use
the sacred art that stops life from decreasing.

57
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,790
Of course not.

58
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:25,590
The sacred arts' source is the sacred power that
Solus and Terraria suffuse the air and the land with.

59
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,300
The more elaborate the sacred art,
the more sacred power it requires.

60
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,390
There's nobody who can wield such a power,
not even in Zakkaria.

61
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:42,860
I see. If only there was a sacred art
that would finally let us chop down this tree.

62
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,320
Well, that would make my life easier.

63
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,700
So we can only keep chipping away
with this axâ€”

64
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,240
Hey, Eugeo.

65
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,330
Does the town have anything
tougher than this ax?

66
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:01,090
There's not. The only thing stronger than this ax
would have to be an Integrity Knight's...

67
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,050
Well, it's no substitute for an ax, but...

68
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,470
There's something I want to show you.

69
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,730
Hey, are you all right?

70
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,150
Can I open it?

71
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,320
Y-Yeah. Be careful, though.

72
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,620
If it falls on your foot,
you'll have more than just a scratch.

73
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:52,890
This is...

74
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,970
In the fairy tale, it's known as the Blue Rose Sword.

75
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,520
Fairy tale?

76
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,440
Three hundred years ago, a swordsman named Bercouli
traveled to the End Mountains,

77
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,190
and in the lair of the white dragon, a protector
of the realm of humanity, he found a single sword.

78
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,360
It's just a silly story.

79
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,620
Or it would be, if certain children
hadn't decided to go find out if it was true.

80
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,370
I mentioned it yesterday, remember?

81
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,880
That I went to the End Mountains
with Alice six years ago?

82
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,540
That's where I found this sword.

83
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,210
Back then, I couldn't even lift it up.

84
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:32,430
Really? So that means
the fairy tale was true, huh?

85
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,600
Well, there was nothing left
of the dragon but bones.

86
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,770
And then after that,
Alice entered the Dark Territory...

87
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,360
When Alice was taken away,

88
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,360
I just stood there and watched,
unable to do anything.

89
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,150
I tried to save her.

90
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,860
But it was like my arms and legs were frozen.

91
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,200
Oh, sorry. We were talking about the sword, right?

92
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,700
I couldn't stop thinking about it,
so the summer before last,

93
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,000
I went to the cave to the north to retrieve it.

94
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,540
I hauled it back little by little,
but it was so heavy, it took me three months.

95
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,420
Three months? That's amazing.

96
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,130
Why would you do that?

97
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,470
I was hoping that
I'd be able to swing this sword one day.

98
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,350
I can't swing it at all right now,
but how about you?

99
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,810
Leave it to me. After all, I'm a swordsman!

100
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,660
So it's too much for even you to handle, huh?

101
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,330
What material is this sword made of?

102
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,450
It's not ordinary steel, is it?

103
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,500
And it's not silver or dragonbone, either.

104
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,710
So I think it might be a Divine Object.

105
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,040
Divine Object?

106
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:54,010
Something that either took shape with the gods' help,
or else was created by the gods themselves.

107
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,720
We call things like that a Divine Object.

108
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,350
I see.

109
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,890
Hey, Eugeo, would you mind
checking the Gigas Cedar's life right now?

110
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,770
I have to ask... you're not going
to strike it with that sword, are you?

111
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,360
Is there a rule in the Taboo Index that says
we can't strike the Gigas Cedar with a sword?

112
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,320
For some reason, I have the feeling
that something like this has happened before.

113
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,250
Let's see... It's 232,315.

114
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,540
All right. Remember that, okay?

115
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,810
I told you so!

116
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,270
This isn't good.

117
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,150
I told you, it's impossible for us.

118
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,570
No way...

119
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,410
That much, from just one strike?

120
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,500
You actually cut into it.

121
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,540
See? Take a look at its life again.

122
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,790
O-Okay.

123
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,590
232,314.

124
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,390
Wh-What? It only went down by one?

125
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,550
You cut into it in the wrong spot.

126
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:27,520
If you'd hit the center of the cut instead of the bark,
I bet that would've decreased its life more.

127
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:32,820
It's true that we may be able to
carve into this tree a lot faster with this sword.

128
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,030
But that's only if we're able to master it.

129
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,490
Maybe I can't do it, but what about you, Eugeo?

130
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,410
I already told you, I can't swing it well, either.

131
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,370
I'll give you some swordsmanship tips.

132
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,460
Well, just once, then.

133
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,460
S-So heavy!

134
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,930
Use your body weight
more than you would with an ax,

135
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,310
and use your whole body,
not just arm strength, for balance.

136
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,040
H-Hey! Are you okay?

137
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,540
Like I said, Kirito, it's impossible.

138
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:34,250
It seemed like a good idea...

139
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:46,430
So this durability is what Eugeo refers to as "life"?

140
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:52,440
"Object Control Authority, 38"?
A parameter for controlling objects?

141
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,690
It's higher than my authority.

142
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,740
This is heavenly.

143
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,200
<i>Is there really no way
for me to get to the central city?</i>

144
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,670
<i>It's not like Eugeo would ever think
of shirking his Calling...</i>

145
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,960
The ultimate law that no one dares to break...
the Taboo Index, huh?

146
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:25,300
<i>What is the Axiom Church,
that made the Taboo Index in the first place?</i>

147
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,390
<i>If this is some kind of simulated civilization
populated by Artificial Fluctlights,</i>

148
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,020
<i>any rules to inhibit the actions of the AIs
would only backfire.</i>

149
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,020
<i>No, hold on.</i>

150
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,860
<i>If I remember correctly,</i>

151
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,200
<i>that girl named Alice violated the Taboo Index
by entering the land of darkness.</i>

152
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,780
<i>And of her own volition, too.</i>

153
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,950
<i>An AI that's deviated from the system...</i>

154
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,700
<i>Alice, who are you?</i>

155
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,160
Huh? Is somebody still in there?

156
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,500
O-Oh, sorry! I'll be right out!

157
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,210
N-No, you can take your time.

158
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,920
Anyway, I'm heading back to my room now.
Good night.

159
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,550
Selka!

160
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,010
There's something I want to ask you.

161
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,730
So what did you want to ask me?

162
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,610
Right.

163
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,030
Well...

164
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:31,910
It's about your older sister... actually.

165
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,710
I heard about her from Eugeo.
That you had an older sister named Alice.

166
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,300
Eugeo? He told you? About Big Sister Alice?

167
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,970
Yeah, how Alice was studying the sacred arts
at this church,

168
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,720
and how she was taken away to the central city
by an Integrity Knight six years ago...

169
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,810
He seems really concerned about her.

170
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,600
Eugeo still thinks about Big Sister Alice...

171
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:01,900
So the reason Eugeo doesn't smile anymore
is because of Big Sister Alice, after all.

172
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,610
Eugeo... doesn't smile?

173
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,450
Yes. He always looks gloomy,
and doesn't have much to say, does he?

174
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,080
R-Right.

175
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:16,910
But when my sister was here,
he always had a smile on his face.

176
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,670
It was actually harder
to catch him when he wasn't smiling.

177
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:28,180
But now, on his days of rest, whether he stays inside
or heads to the forest, he's always alone.

178
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,260
Selka, you like Eugeo, don't you?

179
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,100
You've got the wrong idea! Jeez!

180
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,070
Nobody ever said it out loud,
but they were always sighing.

181
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,860
It was like seeing me reminded them of my sister.

182
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,900
And I can't stand it.

183
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,160
Eugeo's been avoiding me all this time.

184
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:56,870
Even when we do see each other,
he always has a tortured look on his face.

185
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:02,590
It's not my fault
that my sister's not here anymore!

186
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,840
I'm sorry for losing control.

187
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:14,680
N-No, well... I think when you feel like crying,
you should cry.

188
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,180
Yes. You're right.

189
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,350
For some reason, I feel a little better now.

190
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,650
It's been such a long time
since I cried in front of somebody.

191
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,530
Oh? You're impressive, Selka.

192
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,110
Even at my age, I cry a lot in front of people.

193
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,330
Kirito, have you regained your memories?

194
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,330
N-No, it's not like that!

195
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:42,540
A-Anyway, you're your own person.
You can't be someone else.

196
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,920
Just do whatever you can,
and that should be fine.

197
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:48,960
You're right.

198
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,180
I'd better get back now.

199
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,180
Hey...

200
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,480
Did you hear why the Integrity Knight
took my sister away?

201
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,270
Uh, yeah. Why?

202
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,690
I don't know what it was. Nobody will tell me.

203
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,240
So, what was the reason?

204
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:17,660
Um... because she went through the End Mountains
and entered the land of darkness.

205
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,580
I see. The End Mountains...

206
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,340
Tomorrow's a day of rest,
but you're to get up like usual.

207
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,130
I'm not coming to wake you up anymore, okay?

208
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,630
I-I'll try my best.

209
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,530
Good morning.

210
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,200
Oh, good morning.

211
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,120
Mr. Kirito, have you seen Selka?

212
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,450
No, I haven't seen her.

213
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,410
Is that so.

214
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,660
I haven't seen her all morning.

215
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,960
She didn't come to morning service,
and she's not in her room, either.

216
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,670
This has never happened before.

217
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,460
Is that right?

218
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:15,010
If you do happen to see Selka,
will you let me know?

219
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:15,890
Yes.

220
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,180
Eugeo!

221
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,100
Hey, Kirito.

222
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,310
Have you seen Selka?

223
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,270
Huh? No, I haven't.

224
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,560
Sister Azalia's been looking for her.
She hasn't seen her all morning.

225
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,570
Really?

226
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,530
Can you think of anywhere Selka might've gone?

227
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,860
I haven't spoken to her lately, so...

228
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,990
What about you, do you know anything?

229
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,450
<i>I see. The End Mountains...</i>

230
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,460
That's right. Last night I told Selka about Alice.

231
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,420
That she'd entered the land of darkness, and...

232
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,420
Do you think Selka went to the End Mountains?

233
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,930
This is bad! We have to bring her back right away!

234
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,600
What's wrong, Eugeo?

235
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,560
This has been stepped on.

236
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,610
Its life has decreased slightly.

237
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,570
There's no doubt
that somebody came this way a while ago.

238
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,490
So Selka did go to the End Mountains, after all?

239
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,080
Yeah.

240
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,330
This is it, Kirito.

241
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,380
These are the End Mountains?

242
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,920
I was surprised the first time I came here, too.

243
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,470
Just beyond these mountains is
the land of darkness?

244
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:42,890
Let's hurry.

245
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,930
Y-Yeah, right.

246
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,140
System Call.

247
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,690
Generate Luminous Element. Adhere.

248
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,020
Eu-Eugeo... what was that?

249
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:57,740
A sacred art. A really simple one, though.

250
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,240
So you know the meaning of things like System?

251
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,990
Meaning? There is no meaning.
It's just a command.

252
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,920
It's a phrase you use
to call on the gods to bestow a miracle.

253
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,880
Meaning it's a type of spell?

254
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,500
Come on, let's go.

255
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,220
Do you really think
Selka came into a place like this?

256
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,610
Here's a sign that someone came through here.

257
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,480
There's no doubt about it.

258
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,650
Hey, Eugeo...

259
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,660
What?

260
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,450
If Selka does enter the land of darkness,

261
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,910
would she be immediately taken
by an Integrity Knight?

262
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:52,420
No, the Integrity Knight would probably fly
to the village the next morning.

263
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,130
That's what happened six years ago.

264
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:59,170
Then even in the worst-case scenario,
we still have a chance to save Selka.

265
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,800
What do you have in mind, Kirito?

266
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,100
It's simple.

267
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,930
Even if Selka's violated the Taboo Index,

268
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:13,270
if we get her away from the village before today's over,
we might be able to escape the Integrity Knight.

269
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,270
There's no way we could do that.

270
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,610
I have my Calling, for one thing.

271
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,240
I'll take Selka and run away.

272
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,320
Well, this happened
because I said too much.

273
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,660
So I'll take responsibility.

274
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,580
Kirito...

275
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,160
Selka!

276
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,290
That way!

277
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,010
Hide.

278
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,360
<i>Are those goblins?</i>

279
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,830
Selka!

280
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,330
H-Hey...

281
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,680
Hey, look!
Two more White Ium brats just wandered in!

282
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,680
What now? Want to capture them, too?

283
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,190
Even if we took back male Iums,
we could never sell them.

284
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,740
Too much trouble.
Kill them here and turn them into meat!

285
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,200
Eugeo!

286
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,240
Eugeo?

287
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,420
Eugeo!

288
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,080
Eugeo!

289
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,550
Eugeo!

290
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,680
Next time: Departure.
