1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:05,980
<i>Mash's life in a magic school to become
a Divine Visionary has begun.</i>

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,570
<i>Although he can't use magic.</i>

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,610
<i>Although he can't use magic!</i>

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,990
Finn, can you lend me
a broom for tomorrow's class?

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,740
I actually brought a burdock,
thinking it was a broom.

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,790
Burdock? You thought
a burdock was a broom?

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,750
Accidentally.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,790
Accidentally?

9
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,500
Okay. I'll lend you one.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,460
I knew you were a great guy.

11
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:08,730
Today, you will learn how to ride a broom.

12
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,820
Channel magic energy into the broom
and command it with the word "fly."

13
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,360
Then straddle it and regulate the magic
to keep it afloat.

14
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,240
Now, begin.

15
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,990
- Fly.
- Fly!

16
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:29,250
Pops. I'll become number one
and restore our peaceful life.

17
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,670
Okay.

18
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,300
Fly.

19
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,380
Fly.

20
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,090
Fly.

21
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,760
Fl...

22
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,180
Fair enough.

23
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,060
Come on now,
you can't even get a broom to float?

24
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,650
Looks like one of us needs the remedial class.

25
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,070
You're slowing the rest of us down.

26
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,660
Fly.

27
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,160
Th-That's cheating, you worm.

28
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,710
Quit acting innocent.
It flew up before you commanded it.

29
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,250
Why you...

30
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,760
Now, how fast can your broom go?

31
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,050
We will now begin the timed trials.

32
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,260
Perfect timing. How about a little race?

33
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:30,560
Loser has to obey the winner
for as long as we're here. Up for it?

34
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,560
Sure.

35
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,730
<i>Idiot.</i>

36
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:41,950
<i>Unlike transfers, I've been riding brooms
since middle school.</i>

37
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,700
<i>There's no way I'd lose
to someone like you.</i>

38
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,240
<i>Prepare to get swept.</i>

39
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,410
<i>That student...
It's the class clown from yesterday.</i>

40
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,250
<i>Can he even ride a broom?</i>

41
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,090
All right, on your marks.

42
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,340
Ready... go.

43
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,010
<i>What the...</i>

44
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,890
<i>What the heck did I just witness?</i>

45
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,470
No!

46
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:13,100
What incredible speed! A new world record
has been set! A world record!

47
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,060
What just happened?

48
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,360
Didja see that?

49
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,610
I have no clue.

50
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,610
<i>I got a good look.</i>

51
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,780
<i>As soon as she said "start,"
he chucked the broom.</i>

52
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,830
<i>Then he immediately
jumped out towards the broom.</i>

53
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,210
<i>He used air resistance to decrease
his speed, closed the gap to it,</i>

54
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,960
<i>and mounted it in midair.</i>

55
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,710
<i>How is that even possible?</i>

56
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,210
You must have cheated.
There's no way that happened!

57
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,590
Can't face the facts, huh?
I feel kinda bad for you.

58
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,760
Why you...

59
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,560
It's okay. I'll drop the bet, too.
I feel sorry for you.

60
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,770
You mocking m...

61
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,860
Hey, now. Let's not make a scene.

62
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,730
Sorry. My apologies for his rudeness.

63
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,490
This guy here is my friend.

64
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,740
Huh. Well, okay.

65
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,780
Uh-oh. Cavill's talking to him?

66
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,620
He's totally the target now.

67
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,240
We'd better stay out of it.

68
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,500
He's the first victim in high school.

69
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,380
Anyway, what you did earlier
really caught my attention.

70
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,420
Would you like to be friends with me?

71
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,630
Huh.

72
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,670
I'm Lloyd Cavill. Nice to meet you.

73
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,390
Spud Cabbage?

74
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,860
Excuse me, what are you all doing?
We're in the middle of class.

75
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,400
Oh, whoops.

76
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:46,900
You're pretty funny. You should
come here again after school.

77
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,910
I'll be waiting.

78
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,620
Huh.

79
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,700
Middle of class...

80
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,170
As for you... Why'd you have to go
and lose like that?

81
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,170
That was pretty pathetic, you know?

82
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,340
You got made fun of instead.

83
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,840
What a loser you are.

84
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,300
You just couldn't follow simple orders.

85
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,520
I simply told you
to go mess with him.

86
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,690
Oh, well.

87
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,440
At least I found a good toy.

88
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,440
Who was that guy?

89
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,370
Cavill is a continuing student
from the middle school division, like me.

90
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,950
So why is everyone afraid of him?

91
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,870
That's because...

92
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,500
Because he's the son of a high-ranking member
at the Bureau of Magic.

93
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:49,970
Even you must know that the Bureau of Magic
is absolute in this realm.

94
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,220
O-Of course, I know that.

95
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,310
Well, simply put, if you
stand against him, you get expelled.

96
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,270
The vice principal seems to have
close ties with his family.

97
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,690
Get on their bad side,
and they'll force you to drop out.

98
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,120
As a continuing student, I saw it happen
too many times since middle school.

99
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:17,290
For some, the torment
doesn't end after dropping out either.

100
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,000
That's why everyone obeys him.

101
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,920
They're scared.

102
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,510
<i>It's after school.</i>

103
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,390
It's fun to make some
on your own every so often.

104
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,140
I wish Pops could taste
these cream puffs, too.

105
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,980
<i>Well, the choice is yours.</i>

106
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,480
<i>Spend the rest of your life
being hunted down,</i>

107
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,860
<i>or brace yourself to die
and try turning the tables.</i>

108
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,740
I have to become the top student
in this academy no matter what.

109
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,620
I feel like I'm forgetting something.

110
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,210
Oh, well.

111
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,920
<i>Mash ticked off someone
who you really shouldn't cross.</i>

112
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,130
<i>The next day.</i>

113
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,380
The next class is Potions, so...

114
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,640
Oh no.

115
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,430
My textbook is falling apart.

116
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,020
Hello.

117
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,150
You didn't show up yesterday.
What were you doing?

118
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,780
Oh, I'm sorry.

119
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,410
I was making some cream puffs.

120
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,580
Anyway, I heard you're aiming
to be the Divine Visionary.

121
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,420
I'm good friends with the vice principal,
so I have some connections.

122
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:54,930
If you do what I tell you, I could put in
a good word for you. What do you say?

123
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,760
Really? Whoopee. I'll do it.

124
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,060
But why so suddenly?

125
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,270
Well, you seem like a fun person,
and I want to help out.

126
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:07,020
But it'd be weird to have
no strings attached, right?

127
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,940
Good point.

128
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,820
So, for starters, carry these for us.

129
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,440
'Kay.

130
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,160
Ugh, my shoes are dirty. Wipe them for me.

131
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,950
'Kay.

132
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,030
- Gimme a drink.
- 'Kay.

133
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,910
- Massage my shoulders.
- 'Kay.

134
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,620
- Do something funny.
- â€˜Kay.

135
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,960
'Kay.

136
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,710
Next class is, let's see...

137
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,010
Another textbook torn up.

138
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,220
Finn, can you show me your textbook?

139
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,720
S-Sorry. Ask someone else to...

140
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:44,980
Thanks.

141
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,600
Um, I said no...

142
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,610
You're a real lifesaver.

143
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,690
And thanks for the broom yesterday.

144
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,740
These cream puffs are my thanks.

145
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,450
Uh, okay.

146
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,700
But I really am glad.

147
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,250
To have a great guy like you for a friend.

148
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,460
Yeah.

149
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,420
Wow, you're such a great guy.

150
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,970
I'm totally in your debt. You're a lifesaver.

151
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,720
Don't even mention it.
You've been a big help.

152
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,440
Sorry, sorry. I spilled some.
Clean it up, will you?

153
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,440
Hm? What's wrong?

154
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,740
You will do it, won't you?

155
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,950
So Potions is up next.

156
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,330
I really don't like that teacher.

157
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,830
Maybe I'll have
the vice principal have them fired.

158
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,500
Ain't that a little extreme?

159
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,720
It's so clean it sparkles.

160
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,720
Oh.

161
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,140
I can't believe he does whatever we say.

162
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,140
Maybe he'll catch on soon?

163
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,390
I'm getting bored of textbooks.

164
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,730
Next, I want you to burn his clothes.

165
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,900
Got that, Finn?

166
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,150
If you go that far,
maybe he'll quit school on his own?

167
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,240
I can't do this anymore.

168
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,740
What was that?
I didn't quite hear you. Say it again.

169
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,250
I said...

170
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,000
I can't do this anymore.

171
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,420
I see.

172
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,800
You've made a mistake.

173
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,640
When you make a mistake,
you drop down and beg for forgiveness.

174
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,890
Where did Finn go?

175
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,190
I accidentally
took his textbook with me.

176
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,280
What's that sound?

177
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,410
M-Mash.

178
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,500
If it isn't Mash.

179
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,420
What are you doing?

180
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,670
Getting an apology.

181
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,470
Because he got a bit ahead of himself.

182
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,510
Are you okay, Finn?

183
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:29,970
Yeah.

184
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,430
But you're bleeding.

185
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,520
That doesn't matter right now, Mash.

186
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,820
I-It was me.

187
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,070
The one who ruined your textbooks...
It was me.

188
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,080
I was ordered to.

189
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,540
I was too scared to disobey.

190
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,080
But you kept saying I was a great guy.

191
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:58,000
You called me your friend, but...

192
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,050
Still, I did horrible things to you.

193
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,220
So I just... I needed to apologize to you.

194
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,680
I'm so very sorry. Sorry.

195
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:14,270
If only you'd honestly
apologized to me like that...

196
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,320
Oh, by the way, I'm about
to dine with the vice principal.

197
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,110
Care to join us, Mash?

198
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,240
You can leave that dirty little lackey here.

199
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,620
I've been dying to introduce you.

200
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:31,240
You might never get a chance like this again.

201
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,000
Especially if you keep company
with someone who only apologizes, like him.

202
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,090
You're the one who should apologize.

203
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,180
You're the one who should apologize.

204
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,270
Wut?

205
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,020
Double wut?

206
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,190
Th-That'll get you expelled.

207
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,280
Is that a big deal?

208
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,780
Mash.

209
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,280
Oh.

210
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,790
Maybe it is a big deal.

211
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,540
I might've done something bad.

212
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,800
Yes, that's right.
You have done something bad.

213
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,050
V-Vice Principal Farman.

214
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,430
What are you doing here?

215
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:35,060
This young boy's father
entrusted me with his son.

216
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,310
I witnessed the entire incident.

217
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,150
If you witnessed the whole thing, thenâ€”

218
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,820
This was a violent attack on a student.

219
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,860
Finn Ames and Mash Burnedead.

220
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,070
We will hold a school conference
regarding your roles in this incident.

221
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:49,950
Huh?

222
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,080
Surely you can see why
if you think about it.

223
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,830
You two and he are of different status.

224
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,920
Different social status
means different treatment.

225
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,670
Are you too ignorant
to figure that out, you idiot?

226
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,750
Then, I will enlighten you idiots.

227
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,840
This is how the world operates.

228
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,800
<i>The vice principal.</i>

229
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,850
<i>Not him too.</i>

230
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,600
He didn't seem that open to reason,
so I couldn't help it.

231
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,520
But really, after one, what's one more?

232
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,360
<i>That's serial killer logic!</i>

233
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,690
You assaulted me.

234
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:33,620
I can expel ordinary students
like you at any time.

235
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,240
Lepios Oga.

236
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,620
What is this?

237
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,380
Dirt?

238
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,630
Wha...

239
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,880
What... Sto...

240
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,130
What do you think you're doing?

241
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,140
Burying you.

242
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:58,560
And you think you can get away with this?

243
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,180
- I can have youâ€”
- Just like...

244
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,690
you can expel me at any time,

245
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,270
I can bury you at any time.

246
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:14,160
Throw me in prison. Or cut my body in two.
Even if I have to crawl over, I will bury you.

247
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,910
Wait... Stop... Cut it out!

248
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,910
I'm serious! Stop!

249
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,670
Stop it. No!

250
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,930
I assume you know why
you were summoned here?

251
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,390
Because I made cream puffs
in the dorm kitchen without asking.

252
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,930
Completely wrong.

253
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:46,190
You punched young Cavill,
and buried the vice principal.

254
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,440
This issue was seen as a problem
over at the Bureau of Magic.

255
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,450
Here. I have a notice from the Bureau of Magic
to expel you immediately.

256
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,370
The Bureau of Magic
is this country's highest legal authority.

257
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,500
It's no stretch to say they control this country.

258
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,380
At the core of their organization
are the Divine Visionaries.

259
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:14,300
This academy furnishes the Bureau
with those qualified to become Divine Visionaries.

260
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,470
As I'm sure you're aware, young Cavill
is a high-ranking member's son of the Bureau.

261
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,640
In other words...

262
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,900
You have done something unforgivable.

263
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,740
However...

264
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:40,490
What is even more unforgivable is a world
where the caring are at a disadvantage.

265
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,500
I've been concerned
by the current state of things in this world.

266
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,460
Which is why I took
this position several years ago.

267
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:55,420
Currently the world turns with authority,
power, and the self-serving at its center.

268
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:00,680
We have frighteningly few people like you,
who sacrifice themselves and act.

269
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,890
The Divine Visionaries who lead
the Bureau of Magic have a role.

270
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,520
That role is to carefully consider
what the people desire.

271
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:17,570
That is why I sincerely hope that someday,
someone like you will become a Divine Visionary.

272
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,160
No need to tell me. I already plan to.

273
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,160
Wonderful. That's the spirit.

274
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,250
Allow me to explain how you will do that.

275
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,420
'Kay.

276
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:34,670
To be chosen as a Divine Visionary,
you must be the top student at this academy.

277
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:39,930
That requires gathering enough coins
through schoolwork and activities.

278
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,640
There are three types of coins.
Gold, silver, and bronze.

279
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,180
The type of coin you receive
is further differentiated by task.

280
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:52,940
It is tradition that every year, those who have
a certain number of gold coins... Huh?

281
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,690
He's passed out.

282
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,360
I overloaded him with information
to the point of unconsciousness.

283
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,830
Mash. Mash!

284
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,950
I'm sorry. I was overloaded with information,
so I couldn't help it.

285
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,460
Sorry. Let me condense it for you.

286
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:18,220
Earn high marks in your classes and school activities.
And acquire as many coins as possible.

287
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:22,970
I will handle the vice principal
and the Bureau of Magic.

288
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,970
Do you understand, Mash?

289
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,140
I am counting on you.

290
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,730
'Kay.

291
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,810
Then I'll be going now.

292
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:39,900
<i>There is one more problem
you will eventually have to face.</i>

293
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,490
<i>But I have faith in you.</i>

294
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,160
<i>That you can overcome it.</i>

295
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,120
<i>And thus, Mash ended up
with no punishment.</i>

296
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,750
<i>However, by defeating
the infamous Cavill and vice principal,</i>

297
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:59,220
<i>he became someone who was acknowledged
by the other students.</i>

298
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:04,550
When making cream puffs, it's all about
preventing the batter from cooling.

299
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,760
Uh, wow, I see.

300
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,520
You there, with the mushroom head!

301
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,440
How would you like to represent
Adler dorm in a Duelo match?

302
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,810
And let's burn out together
in this fire that we call life!

303
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,400
It's Lord Tom,
last year's Duelo MVP of the year.

304
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,910
He's such a sportsman that his stuffiness
actually works well for him.

305
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,540
And what's with that guy with that hairdo?
Totally a fungus.

306
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,540
Bet he collects pill bugs at home.

307
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,460
So, what is Duelo?

308
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,550
And what's this fire that we call life?

309
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,920
We compete using our brooms.

310
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,220
It's the number one sport in the Magic Realm.

311
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,890
A first-year playing Duelo? That's amazing.

312
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,680
But I can't ride a broom.

313
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,270
Don't be modest.
You blew everyone away in class.

314
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,690
Why are you shouting? Also, I said...

315
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,690
The game's tomorrow.
We're counting on you.

316
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,230
But I...

317
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,400
Shoot for the stars. Even if you miss,
you'll land among your dreams.

318
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,950
This guy's denser than I am.

319
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,120
Hey, I'm counting on you.

320
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,120
I heard you got a new world record?

321
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,080
Today's game is gonna be a piece of cake.

322
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,330
Let's give it our all.

323
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,460
But I can't ride brooms.

324
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:27,760
<i>The first Duelo match this season
is Adler dorm vs. Lang dorm.</i>

325
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,520
<i>Which team will win this match
and earn silver coins?</i>

326
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,690
Go for it!

327
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,150
What's with him?

328
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,150
It's like he's not even trying to fly.

329
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,240
Well, I said I can't ride brooms, so...

330
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,330
If you don't wanna be here, then go home!

331
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,990
- Stop screwing around!
- Go home already!

332
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,500
I want to go home.

333
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,000
<i>If you go home, you won't be able
to become a Divine Visionary.</i>

334
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:02,840
<i>In order to regain your peaceful life
with Pops, fly. You have to fly, Mash.</i>
