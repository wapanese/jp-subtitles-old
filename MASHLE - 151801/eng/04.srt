1
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:14,860
<i>Mash was chosen as a player for Duelo,
an aerial magic sport using brooms.</i>

2
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,500
<i>However, he can't use magic,
so he couldn't fly.</i>

3
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,800
I want to go home.

4
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,510
<i>Yeah, you should.</i>

5
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,060
What are you doing? Get flying already!

6
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,480
Is this match rigged?

7
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,350
Mash, you need to start flying soon.

8
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,310
What's wrong, Mash?

9
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,020
Hey, Mash.

10
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,940
Oh, Captain.

11
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,240
Are you glistening in the fire called life?
Is your heart throbbing?

12
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,620
I don't get it.

13
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,160
You swore that we would be number one!

14
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,700
I didn't.

15
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,500
Don't be complacent!

16
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,170
I'm not.

17
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,420
Mash! Remember the mighty bamboo!

18
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,130
Bamboo?

19
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,170
Bamboo can survive any climate!
They're strong and supple!

20
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,800
That's what you're lacking right now!
And it’s bamboo!

21
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,640
- Bamboo, bamboo, bamboo. Bamboo it!
- This guy has to be high.

22
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,230
Oh, right. I haven't told you
the rules for Duelo yet.

23
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,770
It's pretty simple.

24
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:56,070
We fight over control of the ball midair.
Pass it through that ring for a point.

25
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,150
Wait, they scored another point?

26
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,910
Magic is forbidden.

27
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,280
This sport is all about your broom technique.

28
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,660
Bamboo that can't fly are just shoots!

29
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,540
<i>He doesn't think at all
before he speaks.</i>

30
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,710
This goes without saying,
but I put everything into Duelo.

31
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,840
That's why I recruited you.

32
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,680
I'm heading back out there.

33
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,680
It's all up to you now.

34
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,440
Lord Tom, last year's
Duelo MVP of the year is...

35
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,200
Lord Tom, the sportsman whose
stuffiness actually works well is...

36
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,950
Oops, sorry. That was an accident.

37
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,000
Captain...

38
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,330
An additional point for Lang dorm!

39
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,210
They have a 40 point lead
against Adler dorm!

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,340
Are you okay?

41
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,880
Sorry. I think I broke a bone.

42
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,470
Wh-Where's your sense of sportsmanship?

43
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,640
Huh?

44
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,730
Sportsmanship is nonsense.

45
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,140
All that matters is winning.

46
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,570
Keep huddling, wusses!

47
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,900
How pathetic.

48
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,660
There isn't much time left.

49
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,780
And they've got a huge lead.

50
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,870
But Mash, I just want you to know...

51
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,500
Winning isn't what matters!

52
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
What matters is
whether you gave it your all!

53
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,670
Another point for Lang dorm!

54
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,510
Will this lead be impossible to diminish?

55
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,010
With two down, it's only natural we win.

56
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,560
Mash...

57
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,900
He flew!

58
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,360
H-Hey! Look, he's stopped in midair!

59
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,450
You're kidding me!

60
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,950
He was able to fly?

61
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,210
<i>He's sure kicking his legs a lot.</i>

62
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,420
Time for a thrashing.

63
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,880
Hey, pass it here!

64
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,670
S-Sure.

65
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,180
Hey, he's got the ball.

66
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,390
What's he gonna do from that distance?

67
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,970
Is he joking?

68
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,560
He can't even ride a broom.
What makes him think...

69
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,480
I'll take that from ya, you nobody!

70
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,500
Adler dorm scores!

71
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,250
What an amazing shot!

72
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:01,290
They're still down 49 points,
and time's nearly up!

73
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,000
Wait! Look at that! The ball!

74
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,260
What!?

75
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,020
What unnaturally strong fingers!
That curve-ball was out of this world!

76
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,220
No way.

77
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,550
What the...

78
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,970
Freaky.

79
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,010
But that score...

80
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,310
It's undeniable.

81
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,810
<i>The winner of the first Duelo match
for this season is Adler dorm!</i>

82
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,020
Not bad for looking like a fungus!

83
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,820
Sorry for telling you to go home!

84
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,440
Totes sorry for throwing garbage at you!

85
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,990
<i>Mash and the Adler dorm team
scored a record-high</i>
Totes sorry for throwing garbage at you!

86
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,280
<i>Mash and the Adler dorm team
scored a record-high</i>

87
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,200
<i>and were given silver coins.</i>

88
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,000
What's with this shape?

89
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,460
Wow, that was an amazing game!

90
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,500
And you got a silver coin
so soon after transferring here.

91
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,750
Thanks, but I’m never doing that again.

92
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,000
Hey, Mash!

93
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,720
It's Lord Tom!

94
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,220
Huh? What? What's going on?

95
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,640
Thank you!

96
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,470
You turned into one great bamboo!

97
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,020
You really grew there, bamboo!
You overshot me, bamboo! Did you feel it?
<i>I don't really get along with this type.
At all.</i>

98
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,230
You really grew there, bamboo!
You overshot me, bamboo! Did you feel it?

99
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,060
<i>First-year student Mash,</i>

100
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,110
<i>the key player of the game
who broke the record for game score,</i>

101
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:56,080
<i>said in his interview he credits his success
to his upperclassman's exuberant encouragement.</i>

102
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,200
<i>Quite a humble answer
despite such a great record.</i>

103
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,870
The one from the entrance exams.

104
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:10,630
He risked failing for a complete stranger.

105
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,590
What naivete.

106
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,220
He'll be next.

107
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,600
<i>And the next day.</i>

108
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,650
Mash, it's time for Duelo practice!

109
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,780
Shoot for the stars! Even if you miss,
you'll land among your dreams!

110
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:37,030
Mash, I heard you have trouble studying,
so let's study together!

111
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,450
You swore to me
that we'd take the top together!

112
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,370
I didn't.

113
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,080
I have Potions, Magic History,
Enchantment, Divination, and...

114
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
Way too much.

115
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,710
Don't be complacent!

116
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,380
We are bamboo. Bamboo!

117
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,550
And you have to properly study
Magical Creatures and Dark Arts as well.

118
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,590
What's important is bamboo!
You'll land among your dreams with bamboo!

119
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,050
Finn, help me.
What's important is bamboo!
You'll land among your dreams with bamboo!

120
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:58,760
What's important is bamboo!
You'll land among your dreams with bamboo!

121
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,970
Traitor.

122
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,230
That head of yours is not
a mushroom, but a bamboo!

123
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,150
You seem to be having fun.
That head of yours is not
a mushroom, but a bamboo!

124
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,190
Mind if I join?

125
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,940
<i>This guy...</i>

126
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,910
<i>He has two marks.
I've never seen him before.</i>

127
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,200
<i>Could he be a first year?</i>

128
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,750
<i>That's Lance Crown.
He ranked first in the entrance exams.</i>

129
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,790
<i>Seeing him up close, he's a total hottie.</i>

130
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,920
<i>No, I can't!
I've given my heart to someone else.</i>

131
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,050
No, it's not fun.

132
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,180
I see. Then let's do something
that is fun.

133
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,180
Something fun?

134
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,680
Hide and seek?

135
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,020
Definitely not hide and seek!

136
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,770
This bottle is a special magical tool.

137
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,520
It's quite ancient.

138
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,030
But as you can see,
it's capable of trapping people.

139
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,200
- What's this?
- What in the world?
But as you can see,
it's capable of trapping people.

140
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,530
- What's this?
- What in the world?

141
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:04,500
Stuck in a small space with two guys
has compliance issues!

142
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,580
If you want it back,
come to the forest next to the owl hut.

143
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,880
I'll be waiting.

144
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,270
What's this about?

145
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,520
Call it a bet.

146
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,650
You're after them too, aren't you?
These coins?

147
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,860
A silver coin?
And he's got two of them!

148
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,650
I thought only a select number
of upperclassmen had them!

149
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:42,240
And the lines on your mark reveal
the amount of magic power you currently have.

150
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,410
This guy is really bad news!

151
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,750
<i>Single-line magic users.</i>

152
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,380
<i>A term used to specify those
with just one mark on their face.</i>

153
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,880
<i>The majority of people in this world
are single-line magic users.</i>

154
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,970
<i>But there are rare exceptions
with multiple marks.</i>

155
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,810
<i>Double-line magic users.</i>

156
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:12,440
<i>They exist in this realm
at a rate of one in 100,000.</i>

157
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,900
<i>They're considered chosen
by magic itself.</i>

158
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,200
We'll bet each other's silver coin in a match.

159
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,490
We'll go until the loser
can no longer continue or gives up.

160
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,620
Any other duel involving magic
is considered taboo in this school.

161
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,710
Not that you have
any choice but to accept.

162
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,960
Not as long as I hold this, that is.

163
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:44,090
And judging by your personality, the fact that
I even possess this plays to my favor.

164
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,970
Not that I need the handicap.
It's easy enough to tell who would win.

165
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,150
During the entrance exams,
you were too soft.

166
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:57,440
You prioritized someone else
over your own goals.

167
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:03,240
I could never lose
against a slacker like that.

168
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:03,780
Don't do it, Mash! He's dangerous!

169
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,740
It's over. My life is going to end!
Don't do it, Mash! He's dangerous!

170
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,740
That's right!
I've got a bad feeling about him!
It's over. My life is going to end!

171
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,210
What's wrong? Too scared to respond?

172
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:17,000
No. Enough of that.
Hurry up and get on with it.

173
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,340
At least you've got spirit.

174
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,930
But first, let's make things a bit easier.

175
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,760
Graviole.

176
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,320
I wonder if Mash is doing okay.

177
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,940
I'm worried.

178
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:41,740
What?

179
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,030
No, I'm talking about my profits.

180
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,410
I-I see.

181
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,040
Wh-Wha...

182
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,790
What the hell is this?

183
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,930
This makes things easier.

184
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,300
Flashy performances...

185
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,060
are unnecessary!

186
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,810
Trying to win against me without magic?

187
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,060
Graviole.

188
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,230
Mash!

189
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,030
Are you being serious?

190
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,610
You're acting so half-heartedly.

191
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,530
Do you have any aspirations at all?
Of course you don't.

192
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,000
And yet, you possess a silver coin.

193
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,000
I don't need anyone
encroaching on my playing field.

194
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,920
I'll be the last one standing. Nobody else.

195
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,510
Scum like you can spend your lives
rolling across the ground.

196
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,430
Trying to stand is futile.

197
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,480
No human can withstand this gravity.

198
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,400
I can do enough without standing.

199
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,780
<i>The earth split?</i>

200
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,030
<i>Roots?</i>

201
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,960
<i>That's ridiculous.</i>

202
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,540
Huh?

203
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,460
Do you actually like
rolling on the ground, too?

204
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,470
Graviole!

205
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,270
<i>He's faster than earlier!</i>

206
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,740
What's this?

207
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:03,040
L-L-Lolicon. He's a lolicon.

208
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,630
I-I have to call the police.
He's a criminal.

209
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,760
I'm not.

210
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,800
So, you're aiming to be one?

211
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,970
I said I'm not.

212
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,640
I don't have a Lolita complex.

213
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,190
I have a sister complex.

214
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,520
And that makes it better?

215
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,560
Give it back.

216
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,020
Oh. Okay.

217
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,860
Let me ask you, Mushroom Head.

218
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,820
What's the most precious thing
in this world?

219
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,280
Huh? You're putting me on the spot here.

220
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,830
- Cream pu—
- Wrong.

221
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,330
- Human life.
- Wrong.

222
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,880
- Love.
- Wrong.

223
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,420
- Freedom.
- Wrong.

224
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,340
- Cream pu—
- Wrong!

225
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,130
Wrong, wrong!

226
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,050
Why can't you answer immediately?

227
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,720
One plus one is two.
Yellow and blue makes green.

228
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,600
The answers are obvious.

229
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,100
So, what is the most precious thing
in this world?

230
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,980
My little sister.

231
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,110
Everyone's got different priorities,
don't they?

232
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,320
I am completely disgusted.

233
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,740
This world is full of idiots.

234
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,740
Creepy.

235
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,250
I'm going to drop this bottle off the cliff.

236
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,510
Then, I'll speed up its fall with my magic.

237
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,760
What!?

238
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:36,800
You'll try to grab the bottle
to save your friends.

239
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:41,270
And that's when I'll attack you. Sorry.

240
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,440
<i>I can become endlessly demonic
for my little sister's sake.</i>

241
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,610
<i>Endlessly.</i>

242
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,150
Big brother!

243
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,150
You got in another fight, didn't you?

244
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,320
I didn't.

245
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,660
That's definitely a lie!

246
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,410
Here. Sit down so I can heal you.

247
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,450
So why'd you get into a fight?

248
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,960
I tripped and had a nasty fall.

249
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,250
See, a lie!

250
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,330
You're such a bad liar!

251
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:10,300
I bet you're not even trying!

252
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,090
I am.

253
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:19,180
I heard you saved a kid
who was being bullied.

254
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:23,600
That's why they took note of you,
and you come back injured like this, right?

255
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,560
Geez.

256
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:33,820
But I love how you're clumsy
but kind like that.

257
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,740
I see.

258
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,040
Geez, stop moving! I can't heal you!

259
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,370
Sorry.

260
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,960
Anna. Anna!

261
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,340
Anna.

262
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,720
Apparently it's an incurable disease that
will strip her of her mark and magical power.

263
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,180
The doctor says she has five years at best.

264
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,850
Five years.

265
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:11,520
If she loses her magic, we'll have to
hand her over to the government.

266
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,030
But if we do that, Anna will...

267
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,990
I'm afraid we'll have no choice.

268
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,740
Oh, why was a child like this
born from our blood.

269
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,750
This is for your sake as well, Lance.

270
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:31,210
No way. How can I accept
something so cruel?

271
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,920
My little sister didn't do anything!

272
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,880
Don't touch me!
You guys aren't our parents anymore!

273
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,720
Anna. Anna, I'll make sure...

274
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,640
The Bureau of Magic
made this rotten system.

275
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:55,530
I'll become a Divine Visionary
and make sure to save you!

276
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,490
<i>For your sake, Anna, I'll become...</i>

277
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,410
Graviole!

278
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,420
What will you do, Mushroom Head?

279
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,180
Hamstring Magic.

280
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,930
<i>Hamstring Magic?
I've never heard of any spells like that!</i>

281
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,770
<i>Besides, he's in...</i>

282
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,520
Big Bang Dash.

283
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,440
<i>...starting position?</i>

284
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,030
The choice of losing,
and the choice of not rescuing.

285
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,030
Neither exist for me.

286
00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:00,260
<i>Did he really run down the cliff, catch the bottle,
and come back up in this one instant?</i>

287
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,890
<i>Unbelievable. Is he using
physical enhancement magic?</i>

288
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,520
<i>No, I can't falter now.</i>

289
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,350
<i>I need to help my little sister.</i>

290
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,060
Let's stop this.

291
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,070
You don't seem like a bad guy.

292
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,610
I don't think we should be fighting.

293
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,070
This bottle was empty. It’s fake.

294
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,540
And we're done.

295
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,880
Why?

296
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:42,220
If you keep going,
you might win silver coins!

297
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,760
Are you screwing with me?

298
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,260
No, not really.

299
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,810
Then why...

300
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,020
I guess...

301
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,520
I'm too clumsy to make
rational decisions about everything.

302
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:03,780
<i>But I love how you're clumsy
but kind like that.</i>

303
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,500
What a wet blanket.
I'm heading back.

304
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,080
Just like you said,
we'll stop the fight here.

305
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,260
But I did make a bet with you.

306
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,130
Take it.

307
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,600
If we fought for real,
I wonder what would've happened?

308
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,060
Thank you, Mash.

309
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,650
I was so scared!

310
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,490
I had faith in you
that you could pull it off!

311
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:47,570
Mash, to be modest,
I want you to marry me!

312
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,030
What kind of house would you like?
Of course, the roof will be...

313
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,580
Bamboo it! This is indeed bamboo!
What kind of house would you like?
Of course, the roof will be...

314
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,460
<i>In the end, Lance was a pretty good guy.</i>

315
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,000
<i>And Mash had a thought.</i>

316
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,090
<i>It would’ve been better to open the bottle
after returning to the academy.</i>
