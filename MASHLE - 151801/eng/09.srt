1
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,530
I'm Wirth Madl.

2
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:39,620
Being worthlessly weak
is absolutely inexcusable. Got that?

3
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:40,990
Graviole.

4
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,120
I have no time to be your playmate.

5
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,890
Gravity magic, huh? What a surprise.

6
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,890
This might be fun after all.

7
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,980
Right?

8
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Graviole.

9
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,780
Useless, so useless!

10
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,490
<i>Mud clones.</i>

11
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,830
<i>So I have to crush the real one.</i>

12
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,370
<i>That'll make things quick.</i>

13
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,960
<i>I'll attack the whole field.</i>

14
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,590
Graviole.

15
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,380
Too bad.

16
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,140
Burst!

17
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,270
<i>My legs are stuck. When did he...</i>

18
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,570
The Crown family is renowned
for their gravity magic.

19
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,150
You come from a good bloodline.

20
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,950
Your talent is wasted.

21
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,070
Perfect. You should join Magia Lupus.

22
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,240
Looks like your skills aren't too bad.

23
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,620
Bet you'd fit in nicely in our lower ranks.

24
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,340
And more than anything,
I feel sorry for you.

25
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,300
A magic user of your talents belongs
in an environment where you can flourish.

26
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,720
Your growth depends on those around you.

27
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,140
Surround yourself with garbage
and you'll undoubtedly start to reek.

28
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,310
Meaning?

29
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,520
C'mon! You really need me
to spell it out for you?

30
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:37,530
Those Adlers are trash.
You'll rot too if you stay with them.

31
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,660
People are supposed to be surrounded
by their equals.

32
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,790
Hang around with the dregs
and you just sink to their level.

33
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,540
Being a Magia Lupus is amazing.
We all have so much talent!

34
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,590
We also get excellent education,
tools, potions...

35
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,050
Our environment is designed
to bring out the best magic in us.

36
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,300
An environment to become stronger...

37
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:11,560
The strength of my conviction is not
superficial enough for the environment to matter.

38
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,230
Was that too difficult to grasp?

39
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,400
From my point of view,

40
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,820
you are second-rate.

41
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,570
Second rate? Is that so?

42
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,830
Do you understand what you're saying?

43
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,330
Graviole.

44
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,590
<i>He shifted gravity sideways to a wall.</i>

45
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,970
<i>But it won't make a difference.</i>

46
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:50,220
<i>I cushion walls and floors with
a muddy environment to absorb shocks.</i>

47
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,100
<i>Gravity magic needs a place
to slam your opponent into.</i>

48
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,770
<i>As long as he doesn't figure
this trick out, I'm impervi...</i>

49
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:07,110
<i>He's shooting rubble created earlier
into the mud using gravity.</i>

50
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:18,790
<i>Did this kid already realize
what my anti-gravity trick is?</i>

51
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,880
You said people become stronger
with a better environment.

52
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,050
Yeah?

53
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:30,890
Based on your logic, it appears
my environment is the superior one.

54
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,390
<i>I am strong.</i>

55
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,980
<i>I was born with two marks.</i>

56
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,150
<i>I have a capacity for magic
beyond your average flunky.</i>

57
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,900
<i>I've been at Easton since middle school.</i>

58
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,910
<i>My joining the Magia Lupus was inevitable.</i>

59
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,580
<i>There, I received an education
reserved for Lang's best.</i>

60
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,080
<i>That's right. Of course I'm strong.</i>

61
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,500
<i>After all that, there's no way I couldn't be.</i>

62
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,380
<i>So there's no way I could be weak.</i>

63
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,970
Pretty cocky of you, first-year.

64
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,680
You think you've beaten me?

65
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,440
This is concentrated magical essence,
extracted from other students.

66
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,690
We Magia Lupus are awarded this essence.

67
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,440
We're special!

68
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,200
<i>His magic power further spiked.</i>

69
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,870
Now I'll prove to you...

70
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,210
which of us is right.

71
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,210
Mudoros Secondth!

72
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,610
Mudoro Devilus!

73
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,070
All magic have tiers.

74
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:14,700
Basic magic, personal magic.
Then the more advanced conditional magic.

75
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:20,210
But Secondth is different
from magic used by single-liners.

76
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:26,090
It's higher-tier magic that only certain
double-liners are allowed to cast.

77
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:31,260
That's right.
Only the few worthy can use it.

78
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,800
<i>You must understand, Wirth.</i>

79
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,930
<i>It's your achievements
that determine your worth.</i>

80
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,270
<i>I will be worthy.</i>

81
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:45,610
<i>And in this world, magic means everything.
Your magic determines your worth.</i>

82
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,570
<i>I will be worthy.</i>

83
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,450
<i>Those with an aptitude
for magic have worth.</i>

84
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,870
<i>Those without it are worthless.</i>

85
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,830
<i>You're wrong.</i>

86
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,660
<i>I'm more than my aptitude.</i>

87
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,830
<i>I earned the position
that I am standing in now.</i>

88
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,330
<i>I am worthy.</i>

89
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,760
Because you hang out
with worthless flunkies, this magic

90
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,800
is at a level you'll never achieve!

91
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:24,770
You called them flunkies, but you really
don't understand anything, do you?

92
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,480
He reminded me of something important.

93
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:36,200
<i>I'm too clumsy to make
rational decisions about everything.</i>

94
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:42,250
So the only one allowed
to insult them as flunkies is me.

95
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,710
Graviole Secondth.

96
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,550
Torture Pole!

97
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,140
<i>Mudoro Devilus's movement...
So these pillars...</i>

98
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,310
That's right.

99
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:12,740
These pillars exert
strong gravitational pulls toward them.

100
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:19,240
And that monster surrounded by the pillars
will be pulled by gravity from all directions

101
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,240
and ripped apart.

102
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,500
<i>My strongest spell was defeated?</i>

103
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,220
<i>Are you saying I was defeated?</i>

104
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,760
<i>But I...</i>

105
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,430
Acknowledged by the top of your dorm?

106
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,850
You're striving to be the top at Easton.

107
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,770
Entering the Bureau alone will not
make you worthy as my creation.

108
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,610
Do you understand?
You are still worthless to me.

109
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,070
When will you finally show me
that you are worth something?

110
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,450
<i>I'm worthless.</i>

111
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,500
This is yours, right? It was on the ground.

112
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,260
That reference text
looks ragged from lots of use.

113
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,590
What do you think gives someone worth?

114
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,640
My parents measured worth by position
and social standing more than anything.

115
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:31,810
Based on your words and actions,
you and I were probably raised similarly.

116
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:36,280
<i>When I grow up, I want to be a singer!</i>

117
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:44,080
In that environment, it feels like
your worth is judged by aptitude and standing.

118
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,370
But I disagree with that.

119
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,080
<i>Hey! You're thinking
I totally can't do it, aren't you?</i>

120
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:54,840
<i>But I think it's important
that I decided to try my best!</i>

121
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,380
I don't like the way you talk or act.

122
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,390
But I respect all the effort you've put in.

123
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,190
<i>That's right.</i>

124
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:18,240
<i>It's not like I wanted to become
a worthy person. The truth is...</i>

125
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,410
Stupid punk.

126
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,620
I didn't ask for your respect.

127
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,900
You can't win. Not against me.

128
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,030
Acceleraise.

129
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,250
Do you understand now?
We're incomparable.

130
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,340
You can continue to challenge me,
knowing that.

131
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,340
But I will not go easy on you.

132
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,220
Even if—

133
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,340
It doesn't matter.

134
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,100
None of that matters. None of it.

135
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,190
"Live in peace with your family."
Is that right?

136
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,480
How revolting.

137
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,570
Your situation is similar to mine,
but those ideas...

138
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,870
You must've been blessed
with whoever was around you.

139
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,580
Fine then.

140
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,250
Please show me your best.

141
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,670
This device drains magic power.

142
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:03,130
In about 30 minutes,
your friend will lose her magic power.

143
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,340
She'll lose her mark
and the ability to use magic forever.

144
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,850
What do you think?

145
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,560
Now your friend will be just like you.

146
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,940
Doesn't that make you happy?

147
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,650
If you're seriously saying that,
then that mask

148
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,150
will be coming off in pieces.

149
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,990
Quite obstinate.

150
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,370
Very well.

151
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,620
Then I will not hold back.

152
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,160
Acceleraise Sphere.

153
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,920
Anyone can spout high-minded ideals.

154
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,130
But in the end, you're all talk.

155
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:59,440
Ultimately, you can't save anyone.

156
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,190
I can't pull out my sword.

157
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,110
Caught you.

158
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,740
<i>Is he clenching his abdominal muscles?</i>

159
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,910
My abs are pretty toned.

160
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,870
Right!?

161
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:31,300
That red eye. Is it...

162
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,180
Bloodshot?

163
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,230
You don't know what this eye means?

164
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,650
Nope.

165
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,110
I'm sorry.

166
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,990
Don't apologize.

167
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,070
Okay.

168
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,080
This eye is called "Evil Eye."

169
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,040
The Eye of the Devil temporarily disables
the magic of all who fall under its gaze.

170
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:06,840
Magic is everything in this world.
Thus, I am a pariah. A target of scorn.

171
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,470
SLUMP...

172
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:13,470
I feel kinda bad now.
You can't use that eye on me at all.

173
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,720
It's fine.

174
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,440
I'm the natural enemy of all magic users.

175
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,400
I've been feared and despised my whole life.

176
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,700
By everyone. Even my parents.

177
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,910
Though, someone as seemingly blessed as you
probably can't understand.

178
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:42,000
There are people in this world
who should have never been born.

179
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,380
Acceleraise Secondth.

180
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,520
Force Field.

181
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,440
An arro...

182
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,620
Surprised by your lack of speed?

183
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,500
This field decreases the speed
of everyone else within it...

184
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,080
and grants that speed to me.

185
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:35,050
You won't get me a second time.
This is truly the end.

186
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,230
<i>What is he...</i>

187
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,990
<i>So much power, even when slowed...</i>

188
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,410
<i>But at that level, my attacks...</i>

189
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,960
<i>I see.</i>

190
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:09,250
<i>He split the floor
to narrow down my movement route.</i>

191
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,420
<i>I need to pull back
and regain my balance...</i>

192
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,430
<i>My foot.</i>

193
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,560
Got you... a second time.

194
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,430
Full Muscles Magic.

195
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,690
Hurricane Rush.

196
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,120
<i>My Secondth spell</i>

197
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,080
<i>was shattered by ridiculous violence?</i>

198
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,290
Glutes!

199
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,880
<i>We're on entirely different levels.</i>

200
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,630
<i>If I lose here, I...</i>

201
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,050
<i>My reason for living will...</i>

202
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,180
Acceleraise!

203
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:12,940
Forearm!

204
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,820
Quadriceps!

205
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,160
Pectorals!

206
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,160
Iliopsoas!

207
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,090
Erector Spinae.

208
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,610
I cannot help but think.

209
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,190
What if I'd been born normal?

210
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:04,490
I was still a young child
when my eye manifested.

211
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,790
My parents were shocked, of course.

212
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:16,170
I was an affront to God's gift of magic.
The Eye of the Devil.

213
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:25,100
Just like the markless children they cull,
my existence was aberrant to this world.

214
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:31,900
My family locked me in a cell in the basement
so people wouldn't know I existed.

215
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,730
At set times,
food appeared right outside my cell.

216
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,780
That was my life for a while,
until one day...

217
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,830
My parents tried to kill me.

218
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:51,330
They must have been at their wits' end
for having a child like me.

219
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,340
I had come to a realization.

220
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,180
That I never should have been born.

221
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,600
However, Lord Abel needed me.

222
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:13,850
Even if it was simply to be a useful tool.

223
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,690
I couldn't even meet that expectation.

224
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:26,910
Once again, I'm back
to being unwanted by anyone.

225
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:32,460
You're probably right
about me being blessed.

226
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,580
I can't even begin
to put myself in your place.

227
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,090
But we could become friends, then...

228
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,550
You're an amenable one, aren't you?

229
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,680
I honestly envy you.

230
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,470
But that's impossible.

231
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:54,060
As long as I have this eye,
your attitude toward me will shift someday, too.

232
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,980
But for your kindness,
let me advise you.

233
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,400
Please do not progress any further.

234
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,450
You cannot defeat Lord Abel.

235
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,870
What you saw when you faced him
was nowhere near his true powers.

236
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,080
Even if you've retained
some stamina in this victory—

237
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,080
Thank you for warning me.

238
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,210
But I have to give him
a good walloping. So, you know.

239
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:26,180
Oh, and I won't change my mind.

240
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,970
No matter how much
the world loathes your eye.

241
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:35,390
No matter what others say
about you because of it.

242
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,480
My attitude toward you won't change.

243
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:47,990
That's how Pops raised me.
Me, who can't use magic.

244
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,870
We should eat cream puffs
together next time.

245
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,710
Later.

246
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,550
What a strange guy.

247
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,940
