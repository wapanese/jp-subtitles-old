1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,810
<i>This is the Magic Realm.</i>

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,690
<i>It is called the Magic Realm
because it is a world that has magic.</i>

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,440
<i>Flying through the sky with a broom,
levitating heavy objects,</i>

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,360
<i>creating something out of nothing...</i>

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,120
<i>Everyone can use magic at their will,</i>

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,710
<i>and in this world,
magic is a natural part of everyday life.</i>

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,670
<i>Magic is believed to be a gift
bestowed by God,</i>

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,050
<i>and mastery of magic determines
one's social status in this world.</i>

9
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,140
<i>In a corner of this world,
where dragons flying about is ordinary...</i>

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,390
<i>Within that deep, deep forest,</i>

11
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,520
<i>there is one whose existence
defies the natural order.</i>

12
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,240
Nothing like a cream puff
after pumping iron.

13
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,210
<i>My name is Regro Burnedead.</i>

14
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,510
<i>I'm a chic and elegant 75-year-old</i>

15
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:42,050
<i>living with my son in a forest
far from other humans.</i>

16
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,310
<i>I was quite reckless
in all sorts of ways in my youth,</i>

17
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,310
<i>but when you get as old as I,
very little bothers you.</i>

18
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,030
<i>And that’s because,</i>

19
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:02,780
<i>through my experiences,
I have acquired ways to combat stress.</i>

20
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,240
<i>How to combat stress...</i>

21
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,830
Oh, Pops. I'm home.

22
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,920
Why!?

23
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,630
Why did you rip the door off
its hinges to come in, Mash!?

24
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,880
I couldn't remember
if I was supposed to push or pull.

25
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,090
How many years have you lived here!?

26
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,800
So I just kind of forced—

27
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,590
And you ended up breaking it!

28
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,600
Sorry, Pops. I'll fix it.

29
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,640
Oh, well... If you're repenting, then...

30
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,610
<i>He's always so amenable
after each screwup.</i>

31
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,860
Turn! Turn it! Turn it!
You need to turn it!

32
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,610
- Weird. It won't fit back in.
- That's the wrong position!

33
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,660
Huh? What'd you say?

34
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,370
Quit with the pounding, would you!?

35
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,540
Spit on the foundling?

36
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,000
No!

37
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,920
Sorry, Pops.

38
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,460
I'll fix it.

39
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,250
W-Well... Yeah, um...

40
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,090
Mash, did you finish
today's training routine?

41
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,220
Of course.

42
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,850
Hey, Pops.

43
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,720
I've been meaning to ask...

44
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,770
Why are all of my workouts physical?

45
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,850
Because you...

46
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,310
<i>You're not like ordinary people.</i>

47
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,650
<i>You can't use magic at all
because you're different.</i>

48
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,610
<i>So the least I can do is...</i>

49
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,530
Never mind. A story for another time.

50
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,370
Anyway, I'm heading out for a bit.

51
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,370
I'm trusting you to housesit.

52
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,580
- Okay.
- Don't break the door.

53
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,670
Don’t worry,
I learned how to fix it.

54
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,000
Learn how to open and close
the door instead!

55
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,550
Push in, or pull out...

56
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,510
Pull out! Pull out to open the door!

57
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,640
Anyways, I'm heading out.

58
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,720
I've told you countless times before,

59
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,390
but while I'm out, you must never
venture into the city.

60
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,730
Yeah, I won't.

61
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,400
Right. Mash, you’re such a good,
amenable son.

62
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,360
Now, I'll be on my way.

63
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,740
Be safe.

64
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,660
<i>Sorry, Pops.</i>

65
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,290
<i>But I can't ignore
the call of an empty stomach.</i>

66
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,800
Magic.

67
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,760
Magic.

68
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,680
Magic.

69
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,440
They're still just doing stuff
you can do with your hands.

70
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,440
Seven limited cream puffs, please.

71
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,450
Sure thing.

72
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,990
Oops. I got too excited
and couldn't hold back.

73
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,370
<i>But these don't usually bend
just by squeezing your hand.</i>

74
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,880
Sorry. Let me fix them.

75
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,710
Did you say, "fix"?

76
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,550
This should work.

77
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,840
<i>Huh? Hold on...</i>

78
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,600
<i>Freaky? Huh? No, wait... Um...</i>

79
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,230
Here. Thanks for waiting.

80
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,810
Thank you very much.

81
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,690
Hey, did you see it?

82
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,360
I don't see it anywhere on his face.

83
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,690
- No way.
- You're right. Nothing.

84
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,110
Unbelievable.

85
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,110
Sir, are you actually a...

86
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,990
No, never mind.
Thanks for your patronage.

87
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,620
<i>This year's "Divine Visionary"
has been determined.</i>

88
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:44,210
<i>The one chosen as "Divine Visionary" is Rayne Ames,
a second-year at Easton Magic Academy,</i>

89
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,130
<i>a prestigious school in the Magic Realm.</i>

90
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,760
<i>This title is awarded</i>

91
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,640
<i>to the student demonstrating the highest degree
of excellence over the school year.</i>

92
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:59,350
Yeah, yeah.
Must feel good with all that talent.

93
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:07,280
Then you have me here,
living a dull life in a dull place.

94
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:12,780
P-Please forgive me.
I only stole a little something.

95
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,530
Huh? Are you kidding me?

96
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,920
You gave me more work
with your petty crime.

97
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:27,130
I gotta make you regret it
so you’ll never trouble me again.

98
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,550
S-Stop it! Please!

99
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,560
What is it? I'm busy.

100
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,140
What? There's an unmarked brat
in the city?

101
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,820
Wonder what everyone
was all riled up about back there.

102
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,440
<i>While I'm out, you must never
venture out into the city.</i>

103
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,910
Sorry, Pops.

104
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,570
But it was worth coming here.

105
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,080
I got to eat Goblin Cream Puffs.

106
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,830
Yummy, yummy, yum...

107
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,090
Oh, sorry.

108
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,750
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

109
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,720
What do you think you’re doing?
I'm workin' over here!

110
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,510
I'm a proud member of the magic police,
protecting ordinary folks like you!

111
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,180
And do I get any thanks? No!

112
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,940
The only thing I get is bottom-barrel pay!

113
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,860
Wanna have me
take out my stress on ya?

114
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,940
Would you like a cream puff?
I somehow feel sorry for you.

115
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,530
He's pitying me!

116
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,320
And it's half eaten!

117
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,200
Why would you give me
a half-eaten cream puff?

118
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,580
Ya aimin' for an indirect kiss or something?
Ya love me?

119
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,670
Are ya pickin' a fight?

120
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,920
That's basically pickin'
a fight with this country!

121
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,960
And whatcha gonna do
about my uniform? Huh?

122
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,720
<i>What?</i>

123
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,970
I'm sorry. I will wash
and return these clothes to you.

124
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,350
Now it ain't clothes!
Not as of this moment! Thanks to you!

125
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,980
What exactly did ya do, huh?

126
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,440
What's the matter, Terry?

127
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,360
Brad, this kid...

128
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,450
Don't make a riot over nothing.

129
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,910
More like, why the hell are you naked?

130
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,490
Well, that's because this kid...

131
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,500
<i>Must be him.</i>

132
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,250
<i>The unmarked brat from that report.</i>

133
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,500
<i>Wait.</i>

134
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,260
<i>Would anyone be eating cream puffs
in this kind of situation?</i>

135
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,880
Hey, you over there.

136
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,140
Please excuse my son!

137
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,110
This will be a bit of a hassle,

138
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:53,400
but this may be my chance
for a promotion.

139
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,490
After them!

140
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,750
You idiot!

141
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,710
How may times have I told you?
Don't go to the city on your own!

142
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:16,130
I'm really sorry. I'll never go again.

143
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,800
<i>He's really broken up about it.
It's clear he regrets his actions.</i>

144
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,890
<i>I can't stay mad at him.</i>

145
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,020
Well, if that's the case, yeah.

146
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,770
But as punishment, you'll repeat
this morning's training routine.

147
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:36,860
Okay. And these cream puffs
are for you.

148
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,860
Oh, thank you.

149
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,580
Here.

150
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,290
Thanks, Pops.

151
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,880
<i>He's such a good boy.</i>

152
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,750
<i>I thought a teenage son
would be really passionate,</i>

153
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,260
<i>rife with arguments
and rebellious streaks,</i>

154
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,130
<i>as you deepen your bonds
with each other.</i>

155
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,050
<i>But he's so amenable,
though a bit informal.</i>

156
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,930
<i>Well, I guess he's at an age
where he wants to get out.</i>

157
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,190
<i>We've lived here in hiding until now,
away from the city in this forest, for his sake.</i>

158
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:21,110
But now the magic police
have caught wind of him.

159
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,820
I must act quickly.

160
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,620
What is that?

161
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,680
Hey, old geezer.

162
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,100
Where's the brat I saw earlier?

163
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,850
This is bad.

164
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,530
Five minutes is all I need
when I put my mind to it.

165
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,410
Time to head home and eat cream puffs.

166
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,380
"Crea" a puff, a creamy puff.

167
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,000
"Mp" a creamy, creamy puff.

168
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,510
"uff" a puff, a creamy puff.

169
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,180
Was I supposed to push or pull?

170
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,220
Guess it doesn't matter.

171
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,100
You knew and that's why
you hid that brat, right?

172
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,400
You know why magic has flourished
since the dawn of recorded history?

173
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:41,820
It's because we aggressively rid ourselves
of inferior blood unable to use magic.

174
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,200
It's a necessary sacrifice
for the world to go round.

175
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,580
Simply put, those who can't use magic
have no privileges.

176
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,580
Privilege to live, that is.

177
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,790
Or should I say,
they aren't supposed to live at all?

178
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,340
Spill it. Where’s the brat?

179
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,220
I-I have no idea
what you're talking about.

180
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:14,390
Sheltering the unmarked
is a serious offense, old man.

181
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,850
Hurry up and hand over the brat.

182
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,360
I refuse!

183
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,400
Fess up.

184
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,870
If you play nice and give us the brat,
I'll have my bosses spare you.

185
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,540
<i>I won’t.</i>

186
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,660
<i>Never. I will never tell him.</i>

187
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,130
Why can't you do something so simple!?

188
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,630
I'm sorry.

189
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,880
Your magic is weak.
You can't do anything properly!

190
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,010
Our bloodline has no need
for failures like you!

191
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,890
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,010
Hey! You can't even do something
as simple as this?

193
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,600
You're useless!

194
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,020
I-I apologize.

195
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,480
There are plenty of others
who can replace you!

196
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,770
<i>I have always been a failure of a human.</i>

197
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,780
<i>I kept failing
even after I became an adult.</i>

198
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,570
<i>You messed up again!</i>

199
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,900
<i>You're fired!</i>

200
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,320
<i>How can you keep living like that?</i>

201
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,120
<i>I'd already be dead
from embarrassment.</i>

202
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,290
<i>Completely unwanted.</i>

203
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,170
<i>I thought that's how my life would end.</i>

204
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,600
<i>If that's the case, then I should just...</i>

205
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,820
This baby...

206
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,650
has no mark.

207
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,870
You were abandoned
because you were unmarked.

208
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,080
You're just like me.

209
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:06,090
<i>In this moment, for the first time
in my life, I felt like someone needed me.</i>

210
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,680
<i>I swore on that day...</i>

211
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:18,600
<i>Even if we're not related by blood,
even if the entire world denied his existence,</i>

212
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,310
<i>I would always be a father to that boy!</i>

213
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,980
Tell us where he is already, old man.

214
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,780
Run, Mash!

215
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,200
You old geezer!

216
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,740
Hey! This means
he's still close by! Find him!

217
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,990
Yessir!

218
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,580
Run for it, Mash!

219
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,040
Damn you, old geezer!

220
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,580
- L-Let go of me!
- Run! Run!

221
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,580
Pipe it down, old geezer!

222
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,500
<i>All that matters
is that you're safe! Please!</i>

223
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,590
- Old man, hurry up and...
- Run away!

224
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,890
<i>You are my one and only...</i>

225
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,350
Run! Run away, Mash!

226
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,310
That's enough, old man.

227
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,600
I'll make you regret this.

228
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,880
Hey you! You had some nerve
earlier today when...

229
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,840
<i>My second shirt today...</i>

230
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,850
Why...

231
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,520
Why didn't you run, Mash?

232
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,310
Because we're family.

233
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,110
You're all I've got.

234
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,450
Sorry for being selfish, Pops.

235
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,490
But since I'm here...

236
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,620
I might as well send you guys to hell.

237
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,370
What a joke.

238
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:09,460
You can't even use magic.
How are you going to take me down?

239
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,970
<i>What an idiot. Brad used to be
on the Bureau of Magic's Security Force.</i>

240
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,720
<i>Regular mages around here
don't hold a candle to him.</i>

241
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,060
<i>And a magic-less chump
wants to take him on?</i>

242
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,600
<i>He won't stand a chance!</i>

243
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,190
It'll be over in three seconds.

244
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,360
<i>That’s the spell that drove away a dragon
in his Bureau of Magic's Security Force days!</i>

245
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,370
<i>I didn't think I would get to see it here!</i>

246
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,080
Eat this.

247
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,000
Nalcom Pas!

248
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,080
Mash!

249
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,890
Mash!

250
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,020
<i>Huh? Did he...</i>

251
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,350
<i>My Nalcom Pas... He just...</i>

252
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,100
<i>He slapped it down? Like, “paff”?</i>

253
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,480
<i>Can magic be paff'ed just like that?</i>

254
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,820
<i>I drove a dragon away
with that spell, you know?</i>

255
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,360
<i>What? There's no way.</i>

256
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,450
Not bad, brat!

257
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,910
But how about this?

258
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,830
<i>That magical energy output!</i>

259
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,000
<i>Is he trying to destroy
this entire area?</i>

260
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,580
Hold on, Brad!

261
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,170
You shouldn't do that!

262
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,420
Nalcom Pas Diagorus!

263
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,930
Damn it!

264
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,310
<i>This brat...</i>

265
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,310
<i>He's killing the momentum
with his knees!</i>

266
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,980
<i>What a soft touch!</i>

267
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,730
All right, then how about this?

268
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,990
<i>And now he's juggling!</i>

269
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,780
<i>Look at those dribbling moves!</i>

270
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,870
<i>This brat is totally
making a fool of me.</i>

271
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,330
Pops, I'm gonna borrow your wand.

272
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,000
<i>What’s going on?</i>

273
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,630
<i>He can use magic after all?</i>

274
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,550
<i>Doesn't matter.</i>

275
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,760
<i>Ordinary magic
won't even reach me anyway...</i>

276
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:47,950
<i>I've never seen anyone
use a magic wand like that before.</i>

277
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,330
Threaten my family again...

278
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,340
and I'll kill you.

279
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,130
<i>His training was only meant
to teach him self-defense.</i>

280
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,090
<i>How is this physically possible?</i>

281
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,090
<i>Either way, we're done for.</i>

282
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,600
<i>Even if we fend them off
for now, in due time...</i>

283
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,230
Interesting.

284
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,440
Let's make a deal, Mushroom Head.

285
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,900
Do what I ask, and I'll let you
and the old geezer slide.

286
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,110
A deal?

287
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,570
Once a year in this country,

288
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:24,240
one exceptional student
is revered as one of God's chosen.

289
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,620
It's called the "Divine Visionary."

290
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,000
Enroll in a magic school
and be chosen as one.

291
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:36,000
Simply put, if you're selected,
it means God has accepted you.

292
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:39,170
Which means, society will accept you.

293
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:43,130
I just want the fortune and prestige
that comes with it.

294
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,970
I'll back you up, of course.

295
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,760
Don't listen to him, Mash!

296
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,850
Those are the words of someone
who was an enemy until moments ago!

297
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,100
It's up to you
if you want to be skeptical or not.

298
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,520
But if you refuse, we’ll hunt you down
for the rest of your life.

299
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,490
If I'm after you,
the whole country will be, too.

300
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:05,910
You'll be okay because you're tough.
But what about the old man?

301
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:11,410
A life where you can never feel at ease,
and unable to set foot in a city.

302
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,960
Well, the choice is yours.

303
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,790
Spend the rest of your life
being hunted down,

304
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:20,250
or brace yourself to die
and try turning the tables?

305
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,340
- You got a deal.
- Are you sane? It's a magic school!

306
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,640
I'll be fine, Pops. My motivation
is stronger than anyone else.

307
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,230
This isn't about motivation!

308
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,440
Besides...

309
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,110
I want us to be able
to live in peace again.

310
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,360
<i>You're such a good boy.</i>

311
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,980
<i>My son!</i>

312
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,950
Living in peace with Pops.

313
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,330
If it's a world that won't allow
something as natural as that...

314
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,920
Then I've got no choice but to crush it.

315
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,550
With my fist.
