1
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,980
<i>The fight against the Magia Lupus...</i>

2
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,110
<i>Lance was victorious in the battle
with the Third Fang of Magia Lupus, Wirth Madl.</i>

3
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:44,790
<i>Mash also won against the Second Fang
of Magia Lupus, Abyss Razor.</i>

4
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,590
<i>And now, Dot and Finn's battle begins.</i>

5
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,090
<i>Go to the basement.</i>

6
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,010
Disclose.

7
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,320
That geezer sure likes to boss people around.

8
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,620
Love.

9
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,620
I'm leaving this up to you.

10
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,790
Okay.

11
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,750
- Damn you, where do you—
- You know what?

12
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:32,880
My name's Love.
I'm the Fifth Fang of Magia Lupus.

13
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,260
CUTE CUTE

14
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,260
Do ya like me?

15
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,300
Huh?

16
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,760
Hey. Do you like me, or don't ya?

17
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,850
It's just, I barely know you, so...
Right, Finn?

18
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,390
Y-Yeah.

19
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,900
Okay, so... Am I cute?

20
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,900
Hey, hey. Do ya think I'm cute?

21
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,570
Tell me I'm cute!

22
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,780
<i>She's super manipulative.</i>

23
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,410
Hey, hey, hey!

24
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,410
<i>A normie would find this
manipulativeness so revolting.</i>

25
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,030
C'mon!

26
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,910
Am I cute?

27
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,410
But I really love girls like that, damn it!

28
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,410
THMP

29
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,630
But I have a future fiancée
named Lemon already.

30
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,460
So I'm sorry, I can't marry you.

31
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,670
<i>This isn't even a conversation!</i>

32
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,550
What? You love someone else?

33
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Yeah.

34
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,720
Do you like her more than Love?

35
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,970
Sorry.

36
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,350
I see.

37
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,270
Then I guess...

38
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,190
you can die.

39
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,570
<i>What an emotionally unstable girl!</i>

40
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,950
Tornegus!

41
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:41,950
Explomb!

42
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,580
<i>Damn it. I knew a double-liner'd
be tough in terms of magic power...</i>

43
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,580
All girls...

44
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,090
are born princesses!

45
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,170
You tell them they're cute!
And you love and serve them!

46
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,090
Any guy who can't do that...

47
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,220
can just die already!

48
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,890
That's so extreme.

49
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,230
I'm scared.

50
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,270
So I'll ask one more time, okay?

51
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,150
Well? Do ya love me, or don't ya?

52
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:22,240
<i>Geez. We just met, and she says
love her or die. Is she nuts?</i>

53
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,860
Hey.

54
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,110
Am I cute?

55
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,620
But you know what? I'm totally into it!

56
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,620
THMP

57
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,170
But still, I have a future fiancée
named Lemon already.

58
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,460
So once again, I'm sorry. I can't marry you.

59
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,380
<i>Didn't we just go over this?</i>

60
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,260
No, I really am sorry.
Despite my looks, I'm a devoted gu—

61
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,720
Dot!

62
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,020
Not bad.

63
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,020
What isn't?

64
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,190
This just had to happen.

65
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:01,530
Daddy said I can kill
any guy who doesn't cherish me.

66
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,490
Yeah, yeah. Go tell your daddy...

67
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,240
that I don't care what he thinks!

68
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,990
Explomb!

69
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,540
Don't you understand your magic power
is no match against me?

70
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,710
Tornegus!

71
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,970
<i>What? He intentionally aimed short of me
to block my vision.</i>

72
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,220
<i>He's after my wand.</i>

73
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:44,110
Too bad! You're too weak.
You can't beat me.

74
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,610
I'll tell you one more thing.

75
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:55,870
The Fourth Fang of Magia Lupus, Milo Genius,
can turn a specified target to stone.

76
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,500
And by target, I mean the person
who opened that underground door.

77
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,380
I'd say it takes effect around two hours
after he's started storing energy.

78
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,510
Meaning...

79
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,640
If you don't defeat me
and get to the Fourth in 30 minutes...

80
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,140
it's the end for that Mushroom Head
because he'll turn into a statue.

81
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,350
Not that you can do anything about it.

82
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,270
Tornegus Cage!

83
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,280
Once you're caught in this tornado,
it's impossible to escape from it!

84
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,410
Dot!

85
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,410
Having to put up with such weak friends...

86
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,290
Poor Mushroom Head. I feel for him.

87
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,800
Though, it's what he gets
for going up against Lord Abel.

88
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,180
Facing someone
without knowing their strength...

89
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,300
He's clueless. Just like you.

90
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,310
It really is so funny!

91
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,020
<i>It hurts all over. I feel like I'm dying.</i>

92
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,520
<i>Even my bones sting.</i>

93
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,020
<i>I can barely breathe.</i>

94
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,610
<i>This girl's right.</i>

95
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,660
<i>She outclasses me.
There's nothing I can do.</i>

96
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,080
<i>Hey, Dot!</i>

97
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,160
You got a new broom, right?

98
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,830
Trade with me.

99
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,460
B-But... This broom is...

100
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,670
Come on, it's fine, right?

101
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,090
Uh, okay.

102
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,760
Thanks!

103
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,100
Here.

104
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,940
Thanks, Sis.

105
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,610
You really are pathetic.
You should fight back.

106
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:51,280
It's fine.
If I fight back, it just gets worse.

107
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,990
You seriously give up too easily.

108
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,790
But...

109
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,870
That's gonna be a problem
once you get a real friend.

110
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,330
A real friend?

111
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,420
That's right. Someone who'll honestly
get sad or angry on your behalf.

112
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,050
Though, that kinda person
comes around only once in a lifetime.

113
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:20,310
If you find that friend...
never betray them.

114
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,730
<i>Basically, he's having a delusion!</i>

115
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,190
<i>Does he think he's the main character
or something?</i>

116
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,780
<i>Yeah.</i>

117
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,150
<i>That's so cheesy.</i>

118
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,870
<i>I hate stuffy guys like you.</i>

119
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,120
<i>I really am pathetic.</i>

120
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,000
<i>You guys have gone far enough.</i>

121
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,750
<i>Getting scared while she mocks my buddy.</i>

122
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,260
<i>Come at me, scumbag.</i>

123
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,010
<i>He honestly got angry on my behalf, too!</i>

124
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:02,640
Meanwhile, I guess I'll deal with you, Freckles.

125
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,400
Bye-bye.

126
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,900
Tor...

127
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,900
negu...

128
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,120
I can't let it end like this.

129
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,870
Not when you mocked my friend!

130
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,330
<i>Huh?</i>

131
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,290
<i>What's with his magic power?</i>

132
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,420
<i>He broke my spell?</i>

133
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,050
Dot?

134
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,430
You're worn out.
You're just being obnoxious!

135
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,550
Tornegus!

136
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,050
Explomb!

137
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,560
<i>Cancelled out?</i>

138
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,100
<i>His power's jumped up a level!</i>

139
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,060
<i>How did he amplify magic power so quickly?</i>

140
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,070
<i>Wait. That mark. I've heard about it.</i>

141
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,450
<i>Children born with the Warding Cross
on their foreheads...</i>

142
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:03,660
<i>Battle demons who unleash their magic power
when their emotions cross a certain threshold.</i>

143
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,000
<i>The Ira Kreuz!</i>

144
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,220
Insulting my friend is a serious crime.

145
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,140
Machine Gun Explomb!

146
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,600
Thirty minutes before he turns to stone?

147
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,980
There's no way
I'll let you two get in his way.

148
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,030
Come at me, scumbag.

149
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,660
Die... 100 times.

150
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,180
He missed on purpose?

151
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,930
I don't like picking on girls.

152
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,520
Get lost.

153
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,520
Before I change my mind.

154
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,360
O-Okay. Thankyu vewy much.

155
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,820
And there you have it!

156
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,950
<i>He was eerily calm for a moment,
but already back to normal.</i>

157
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,290
<i>Still, he defeated the Fifth Fang all on his own.
I didn't know Dot was a double-liner, too.</i>

158
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,660
Dot, you're amaz...

159
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,180
Dot...

160
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,680
Sorry! I'm sorry, Dot!

161
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,680
I thought I could let you
take care of two single-liners.

162
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,190
But I come back to find this?

163
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,690
Oopsies!

164
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,480
<i>The Fourth Fang.</i>

165
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,900
<i>He gave up his petrification spell
to face us.</i>

166
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,950
It's not like these guys
ever proved to be much of a challenge.

167
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,830
Especially guys like them.

168
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,660
<i>Damn it.</i>

169
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,000
<i>Caught me off guard.</i>

170
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:17,210
<i>Can I even fight the Fourth like this?</i>

171
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:22,220
<i>The Fourth Fang is a prodigy, the only
first-year student among the Magia Lupus.</i>

172
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,970
<i>It's the end for you.</i>

173
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,520
<i>What the...</i>

174
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,190
<i>Was that a sword!?</i>

175
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,650
<i>That magic...</i>

176
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,780
<i>Damn it. What happened?</i>

177
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,570
<i>Why am I...</i>

178
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,320
<i>My magic was broken in an instant.</i>

179
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,580
<i>Wh-Why is he here?</i>

180
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,960
<i>Divine Visionary... Rayne Ames!</i>

181
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,090
Wait, Rayne. Why are you here?

182
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,720
<i>Divine Visionary, Rayne Ames.</i>

183
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,310
<i>Adler dorm's ace!</i>

184
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,850
<i>Divine Visionary or not,
he's still a student.</i>

185
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,980
<i>There's no need to panic.</i>

186
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,730
R-Right. Okay.

187
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,270
Let's talk about this.

188
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,730
We've both got our reasons.

189
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,610
Right?

190
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,660
<i>Wh...</i>

191
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,910
Don't waste my time.

192
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,910
You piece of trash.

193
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,550
<i>He's a student like us, isn't he?</i>

194
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,550
<i>This is what a Visionary
is magically capable of...</i>

195
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,430
Maybe I should defect to Adler for now.

196
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,480
<i>No, no, no. It's too different.
There's too much of a difference.</i>

197
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,200
It's not what you think! I had no choice!

198
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,280
I regret being unable
to stand up against him! Forgive me!

199
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,330
That so?

200
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,670
You regret it?

201
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,470
The most important thing
in this world is actions. Not words.

202
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,390
I don't trust the words of a scum like you.

203
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:39,520
It's best to teach your type...
through pain.

204
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:46,070
So that you never think about
making the same mistake ever again.

205
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,570
<i>I heard he's in Adler like us.
So he's on our side, right?</i>

206
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,120
And what are you guys doing here?

207
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,080
Hurry up and get out.

208
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,540
I'm going to drag the details out of him.

209
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,670
O-Okay.

210
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,090
Spill it.

211
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,340
<i>Dude's harsh.</i>

212
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,510
Hey, didn't you hear me?
I told you to spill it.

213
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,510
<i>But what brings a Divine Visionary here?</i>

214
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,930
Brother.

215
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,810
What?

216
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:26,940
<i>The geezer said
Innocent Zero's pawns are here.</i>

217
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,860
<i>No doubt they're concealing
their power to hide.</i>

218
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,200
<i>But where are they?</i>

219
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,870
Gettin' nutrition. Gettin' nutrition.

220
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,870
NOM NOM

221
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,960
<i>That's not magic.</i>

222
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,960
<i>But this immense pressure...</i>

223
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,840
<i>It must be him.</i>

224
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,130
Need to hurry.

225
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,800
Hurry, and...

226
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,260
I'm short on time.

227
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,140
I'll make this investigation quick.

228
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,770
What?

229
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,020
This creature will measure
your true magic power.

230
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,400
I can tell by magic power levels
if you're really a student or not.

231
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,650
Huh?

232
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,910
These eight legs of mine have tallied
the power of thousands of magic users.

233
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:21,580
If you're a regular magic user,
Master Rayne will let you scuttle on by.

234
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,040
No way.

235
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,300
Excuse me. What was that so suddenly?

236
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,550
That's pretty dangerous.

237
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,810
Stranger danger. So barbaric.

238
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,810
<i>Did he...</i>

239
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,810
<i>use any magic at all?</i>

240
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,770
Z-Zero?

241
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,770
No, no, no, no.

242
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,190
I miscalculated.
A bug in the system. That's all.

243
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,950
<i>He's not registering on the Arachnabus.</i>

244
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,450
<i>Could he be...</i>

245
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,450
Three Percent Partisan.

246
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,960
BAM

247
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,800
<i>He made a chair out of my partisans.</i>

248
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,510
You're kidding me.

249
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:17,260
<i>Arachnabus has lost sight of itself.
It's even stopped using spider puns.</i>

250
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,470
<i>As I expected, this guy isn't using magic.</i>

251
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,980
<i>He's not one of Innocent Zero's men.
However...</i>

252
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,270
I'm getting miffed.

253
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,190
Just one more test.

254
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,610
Ten Percent Partisan.

255
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,120
<i>This is not a spell Master Rayne uses
against a student. This guy is fini...</i>

256
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,240
<i>Practice swings?</i>

257
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,540
<i>Could it be...</i>

258
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,750
<i>Is that...</i>

259
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,210
<i>a bunting stance?</i>

260
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:57,220
<i>He's bunting
all of Master Rayne's attacks and...</i>

261
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,970
<i>tapping them out of commission!</i>

262
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,220
That was dangerous.

263
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,480
<i>Wait, what does this mean?</i>

264
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,730
What's your name?

265
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,400
Mash Burnedead.

266
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,440
<i>Mash.</i>

267
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,200
<i>We have a unique new student.</i>

268
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,120
<i>He's in a very unique situation,</i>

269
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,370
<i>but he has a heart that is quite strong.</i>

270
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,920
<i>I'd like it if you could look out for him.</i>

271
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,880
<i>His name is...</i>

272
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,920
<i>...Burnedead.</i>

273
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,010
I see. You're him.

274
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,850
Allow me to apologize for my rudeness.

275
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,640
I am sorry.

276
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,640
HA-HONK

277
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,640
Not forgiven.

278
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,030
It's not much of an apology,
but take this.

279
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,610
It's a magic kerchief
that will heal your wounds.

280
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,660
Oh, okay.

281
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,500
So you like rabbits?

282
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,510
DROOP

283
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,510
Thank you very much.

284
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,760
Be careful while you're at it.

285
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,850
You're going after Abel, right?

286
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,190
How did you...

287
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:35,440
The old geezer said
you wanted to be a Divine Visionary.

288
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,030
Naturally, you'd run up against Abel.

289
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:45,120
He's definitely going to be one of this year's
Divine Visionary candidates.

290
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:50,540
It's fair to say his doll magic far exceeds
what's required of a student.

291
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,500
I was surprised you could block
my elementary magic with your bare hands.

292
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,050
But without any magic,
you're going to have a tough time.

293
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,930
BLUNT

294
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,800
But I can use magic...

295
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:10,770
In any case, he holds
most of the coins in the school.

296
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,020
Beat him and they'll all be yours,

297
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,940
bringing you a lot closer
to becoming a Divine Visionary candidate.

298
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,700
Our world has no shortage of problems.

299
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,580
For allies, I want people
who are strong on their own.

300
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,250
You said you wanted
to be a Divine Visionary.

301
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,830
Then do it, even if it kills you.

302
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,090
'Kay.

303
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,180
I've got other things to do.
Watch yourself.

304
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,600
Um... Thank you for everything.

305
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,480
This is all for my own sake.
Don't get me wrong.

306
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,270
Later.

307
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,190
He's probably a good guy.

308
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:09,330
<i>He's a curious child who puts his friends
ahead of his own goals.</i>

309
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,620
<i>It could be that
he's just the simple sort.</i>

310
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:19,380
<i>Though meeting him seems to have
saved your younger brother.</i>

311
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,420
<i>You can become a Divine Visionary
even if you can't use magic.</i>

312
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:30,510
<i>And to do that, prove that you're greater
than any magic user.</i>

313
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,140
This must be it.

314
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,600
Do I push or pull to open this door?

315
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,020
Oh, I push to open.

316
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:58,210
Must you destroy every door you enter?

317
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:03,050
I tried to knock,
and this is what happened.

318
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,980
