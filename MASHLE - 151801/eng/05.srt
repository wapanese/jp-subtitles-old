1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,940
<i>There are three dorms
in Easton Magic Academy.</i>

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,780
<i>Students with corresponding characteristics
are assigned to each dorm.</i>

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,910
<i>Adler. Courage and conviction.</i>

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,080
<i>Orca. Wisdom and willingness.</i>

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,000
<i>Lang. Ability and ambition.</i>

6
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,460
<i>The dorms are rivals with one another.</i>

7
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,460
<i>To visualize their principles and positions,</i>

8
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,260
<i>their friendly rivalry
carries across the entire academy.</i>

9
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,020
<i>This is the Adler dorm,
where Mash and Finn reside.</i>

10
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,360
<i>In their room, Room 302...</i>

11
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,780
So, five silver coins make one gold coin?

12
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,660
That's five minus two. Let's see...

13
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,000
Just 28 left.

14
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,460
Five minus two is three.

15
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,750
It's a trick question?

16
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,250
No, there's no tricks about this!

17
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,340
So I'm a meathead?

18
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,880
You got that right, but...

19
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,510
In any case, it's so peaceful today
with nothing going on.

20
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,560
It sure is...

21
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,140
No, there is something!
Our assignment!

22
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,520
Oh. Really?

23
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,900
Crap, crap, I forgot about it!

24
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,190
If we don't submit our Potions assignment,

25
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,780
we'll be severely marked down
and we'll be in the drop-out range!

26
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,950
Want one?

27
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,070
This isn't the time for snacks!

28
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,030
Sorry.

29
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:10,040
I have to do it! I have to do it!
I have to do my Potions assignment!

30
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,540
You still haven't done it yet?

31
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,590
Lance.

32
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,710
Oh, it's the lolicon.

33
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,050
That's siscon to you.

34
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,760
Loitering around doing nothing...

35
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,590
You two are the dictionary definition
of slackers.

36
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,560
Wait, Lance. Did you finish already?

37
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,060
Of course.
I'm a lot more conscious than you are.

38
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,190
<i>I should've expected that
from the top student in our class.</i>

39
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,070
<i>Lance is simply flawless.</i>

40
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,030
Guys like you
might ruin the dorm's reputation.

41
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,820
Have some shame.

42
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,960
He flew backwards by himself?

43
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,420
<i>O, my precious!</i>

44
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,340
<i>Foisting thy fair light
upon my feeble eyes unwarn’d!</i>

45
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,090
<i>‘Tis my fate to succumb
to thy infinite warmth.</i>

46
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,470
<i>I love you!</i>

47
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,600
You use these for the Potions assignment.

48
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,270
<i>What was with that
dramatic display just now?</i>

49
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,640
A mandragora.

50
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,020
Silence their screams and they become
a universal ingredient in potions.

51
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,190
Oh, another thing that uses magic.

52
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,110
"Another"? You know
this is magic school, right?

53
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,830
I'll show you how it's done.

54
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,040
Quientus.

55
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,000
You try.

56
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,420
Quientus.

57
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,010
Quientus!

58
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,890
I can't do it. It won't stop screaming.

59
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,020
Finn.

60
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,350
Your center of gravity is unstable.
Your core muscles are quite weak.

61
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,150
Huh? Core muscles?

62
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,780
Quientus.

63
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,410
<i>I think it's gotten worse?
Its pupils are dilated, too.</i>

64
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,660
Finn, focus your magic
on a single point.

65
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,290
Oh, okay.

66
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,790
Listen up, Finn.

67
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,960
Visualize gently caressing it
as you release the magic.

68
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,050
O-Okay.

69
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,090
Quientus.

70
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,050
Slowly. That's it.

71
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,480
I did it! I did it, Lance!

72
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,570
Even slackers like you
should be able to do this much.

73
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,940
Thanks!

74
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,070
<i>Maybe Lance is really good
at taking care of others.</i>

75
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,070
Oh, yeah. How is Mash doing?

76
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,710
<i>That plant's flipped out! It's so huge!</i>

77
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,890
I did it.

78
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,390
Did you really, though?

79
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,900
Once they're asleep,
they turn into a regular herb.

80
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,610
Now we create a compound.

81
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,360
Compounding is comparatively simple.
Watch closely.

82
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,620
Take this, and first do this.

83
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,620
Then do this.

84
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,870
And do this.

85
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,370
And with this...

86
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,870
It's done.

87
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,590
<i>That's not easy at all!</i>

88
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,590
Got it.

89
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,880
You've got to be lying!

90
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,380
No, really.

91
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,880
Trust me, as long as it's not magic.

92
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,890
First, take this, and then...

93
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,140
Do this...

94
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,640
Then this... And it's done.

95
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,640
<i>That's totally not it!</i>

96
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,810
<i>How did that end up as a cream puff?</i>

97
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,650
You're screwing around, aren't you?

98
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,650
I'm not screwing around.

99
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,240
You start like this.

100
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,410
'Kay.

101
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,700
Then you add this.

102
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,950
'Kay.

103
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,450
Stir well.

104
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,410
'Kay.

105
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,540
Add this last.

106
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,750
'Kay.

107
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:23,920
Okay.

108
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
BA-YUMMY

109
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,670
<i>Why is this!?</i>

110
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,090
<i>I watched him from start to finish.</i>

111
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,800
<i>When did it become a cream puff!?</i>

112
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,760
You’re completely useless
when not fighting, huh?

113
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,060
Well, yeah.

114
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,680
<i>Why is he so confident?</i>

115
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,190
Oh well. Let me warn you.

116
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,820
I won't lose to you ever again.

117
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,780
There's a reason
I need to join the Bureau of Magic.

118
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,830
And that is?

119
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,330
It's none of your business.

120
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,960
But you equaled me,
if not more, in combat.

121
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,220
I will not allow some nobody
to take your coins away from you.

122
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,430
You don't have to warn me,
because it won't happen.

123
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,560
Quick with the comebacks.

124
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,310
Let's try this again.

125
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,350
'Kay.

126
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:26,730
The all-dorm off-campus class
is coming up soon.

127
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,730
I wonder if he'll be all right.

128
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,820
And then, that was when...

129
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,650
No way. Are you serious?

130
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,910
And what happened after that?

131
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,280
That's when...

132
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,120
Hey, you bumped into me
just now, didn't you?

133
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,750
Don't be walkin' into people's faces!

134
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,890
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

135
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,760
What am I supposed to do
if I'm not walkin' into people's faces?

136
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,810
Side characters have no right
to give me orders, you moron!

137
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,530
The Divine Visionaries are the ones
who mold this world.

138
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,530
They rule it.

139
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,660
Tell me, what traits
should a ruler possess?

140
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:26,170
A noble bloodline and overwhelming power
that brooks no argument.

141
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,420
Correct.
Which means it is not those in Adler.

142
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,260
It is us... Lang.

143
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,310
Seize all of their coins.

144
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,680
Yessir.

145
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,930
Nummy.

146
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,520
Ugh, it's tasty? That's a mandragora!

147
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,560
Yum, yum.

148
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,560
Seriously!?

149
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,030
<i>Apparently, mandragora cream puffs are tasty.</i>

150
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,870
<i>And now, the next day...</i>

151
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,790
We're supposed to be
having class here today.

152
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,910
What are we going to do here?

153
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,960
What do you do in a forest...
Camping?

154
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,590
That's for leisure. This is a magic school.

155
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,710
I'm number one!

156
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,670
I'm number one!

157
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,260
I, Dot Barrett,
is the main character of this world!

158
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,060
The world revolves around me!

159
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,480
Whew! It's revolving a bit more than—

160
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,270
Whaddaya think you're looking at!?

161
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,350
Wierdo.

162
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,230
A first-year from our dorm.

163
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,570
Wait, it’s you! The Mushroom Head
people keep talking about!

164
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,410
You look like a side character to me.

165
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,950
Who is this guy?

166
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,740
As of today, you’re a side character
in both name and reality!

167
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,330
Because yours truly is—

168
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,080
Mash!

169
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,590
Outdoor class is a bit scary.

170
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:59,630
I'm not going to push myself too hard.
So Mash, please take care out there, okay?

171
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,760
Thanks.

172
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,510
Mash, could I possibly tag along—

173
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,720
Hey.

174
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:11,980
I'll kill 'im!

175
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:17,820
I friggin' hate guys
who get attention from women!

176
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,990
I'll kill you! I'll triple kill ya!

177
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,490
It's ridiculous to begin with!

178
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,330
The global ratio of men to women
is supposed to be equal!

179
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,500
So why isn't there a single girl
falling in love with me!?

180
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,500
That's right, the answer is simple.

181
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,000
It's because chumps like you
ruin the system!

182
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,210
Guys like you are why we have
an aging population and a lower birthrate!

183
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,010
Won't someone just settle for me!?

184
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,010
That's why I made up my mind!

185
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,760
I'm gonna join the Bureau of Magic
and rid this world of hot guys!

186
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,810
- Oh Mash, I'll totally marry you.
- Do cream puffs count as snacks?

187
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,930
That mandragora cream puff
was tasty, huh?
- Oh Mash, I'll totally marry you.
- Do cream puffs count as snacks?

188
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,060
- Oh Mash, I'll totally marry you.
- Do cream puffs count as snacks?

189
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,350
Listen to me!

190
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,360
My ego gets bruised the most
when I'm ignored!

191
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,280
Quiet, all of you.

192
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,120
Both Adler and Lang will participate
in this outdoor exercise.

193
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,950
Your reward will be either a bronze or silver coin.
Brace yourselves.

194
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,670
Your task is the extermination
of forest scorpions.

195
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,420
Bring me the stones
embedded in their foreheads.

196
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,340
Most forest scorpions
will only earn you bronze coins,

197
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:26,930
but a few are strong enough
to be worth silver coins.

198
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,140
You can identify them easily.

199
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,230
If the stone in their foreheads
are square, they're worth silvers.

200
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,860
Ordinary magic users
almost certainly don't stand a chance.

201
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,110
But such accomplishments
make you Easton students.

202
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,570
Do what you must to survive.

203
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,780
In you go, in order now.

204
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,870
Yeah, it's on!
No way I'm losing to you!

205
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,380
I'd like to make sure to get silver coins here.

206
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,380
I should do my best, too.

207
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,720
You think you're hot stuff, right?

208
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,470
I can tell.

209
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,560
You think you're so special.

210
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,860
You mistakenly think
you're not like the others.

211
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,440
You subconsciously
look down on others, don't you?

212
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,490
Hey, what are you doing over there?

213
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,870
I'll mark you down for that.

214
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,370
Sorry, Professor.
We were just horsing around.

215
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,370
Right, first-year?

216
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,790
Yes, yes. That's the look.

217
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,220
I want to make
a pathetically messed up face outta you.

218
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,590
Looking forward to it, first-year!

219
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,720
Hey, Mash.

220
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,350
Ignore him.

221
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,980
He's one year older than us.

222
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,980
And he's infamous for misconduct.

223
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,650
He's injured multiple teachers
and students he doesn't like,

224
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,740
to the point of being held back a grade.

225
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:11,080
But they consider his talent as a magic user,
so they haven't expelled him yet.

226
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,370
You hear stuff like that often
from Lang dorm.

227
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,710
So, don't bother with them.

228
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,870
I'm glad.

229
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,500
I thought he crushed my cream puff.

230
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:25,010
<i>That's why he made that face?</i>

231
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:30,090
And don't tuck food in there directly.
It's unhygienic.

232
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,140
'Kay.

233
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,390
I smell tremendous danger.

234
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:40,100
I think it's wiser for us to work as a pair.

235
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,110
Leave it to me, the oldest son...

236
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,320
I zoned out, and now I'm all alone.

237
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,490
Oh well.

238
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,870
Yo yo yo, get those tails on out,
damned scorpions!

239
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,870
I'm gonna show up that mushroom head—

240
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,630
Shut up.

241
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:11,300
Just now, I wasted calories because of you.

242
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,100
This is just terrible.

243
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,350
I'll kill 'im.

244
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,770
Fine. Forget about our class.

245
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,270
Right here right now, you're...

246
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,310
Stop it!

247
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,400
Shut up!

248
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
Because of you, I...

249
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,900
I'll make you regret it!

250
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,030
S-Someone... Someone help me!

251
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,530
Explomb.

252
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,010
Raising your hand against a girl...
You're so done as a guy.

253
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,380
U-Um...

254
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,180
Huh?

255
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,560
Thank you so much.

256
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,690
<i>S-S-S-So beautiful!</i>

257
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,570
<i>Nope. Play it cool!
I have to stay calm and act natural!</i>

258
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,490
That was nothing at...

259
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,240
<i>H-H-Her hands... So soft...</i>

260
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,960
You're... so strong.

261
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,040
Argh! I can't do it!

262
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,930
Now, is it almost time?

263
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,020
Thank you so much for what you did earlier.

264
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,860
I-It was nothing.

265
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,450
<i>O-O-Our knees are touching!</i>

266
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:58,160
<i>So, this is the natural distance
of a modern couple?</i>

267
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,450
<i>Stay calm. Be still, my heart.</i>

268
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,960
<i>If I act weird, she'll catch on
that I'm unpopular with girls.</i>

269
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,670
<i>Keep cool. Come on, me. Keep cool.</i>

270
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,710
Cool! Cool! Cool!

271
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,460
What's with him? Freaky.

272
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,680
Huh? What'd you just say?

273
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,760
I was marveling at how
manly and wonderful you are.

274
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,640
Oh no, I actually said wonderful.

275
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,060
Huh? I thought I heard two syllables.

276
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,230
It's the truth.

277
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,730
You really are wonderful.

278
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,700
<i>With my magic, I can make anyone
even slightly attracted to me fall in love.</i>

279
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,870
<i>He's completely fallen for me now.</i>

280
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,290
<i>Though, maybe he might
have fallen even without magic.</i>

281
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,630
<i>Next up, that mushroom head...</i>

282
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:55,510
Thank you too, kind sir.
You were a great help.

283
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,260
Oh, I didn't do anything.

284
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,760
<i>What? That's impossible.</i>

285
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,770
<i>There's never been a man
who hasn't fallen under my spell.</i>

286
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,770
<i>More like, any guy should be like “hurray!”
if a cute girl like me was flirting with him.</i>

287
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,280
<i>I'll have to put more magic energy into it.</i>

288
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,280
That's not true.

289
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,240
You really helped me out.

290
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,740
You're very wonderful.

291
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,080
<i>Sound, sight, touch.
My charm reaches all the senses!</i>

292
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,290
<i>There is no man who can resist this!</i>

293
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,670
I said, I didn't do anything.

294
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,430
<i>It's not working at all!?
What is wrong with this guy?</i>

295
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,550
<i>Does he seriously
not find me attractive!? Die!</i>

296
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,930
<i>Fine. It's ours for the taking
now that I have one of theirs.</i>

297
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,350
But you really did save me.

298
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,230
<i>Such a delicate facial expression.</i>

299
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,450
Do you have some kind of circumstance?
I'll lend an ear.

300
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,450
Actually, there’s a certain boy
threatening me.

301
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,780
A certain boy?

302
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,910
A second-year by the name of Silva.

303
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:10,330
He's someone I don't hear
many good things about.

304
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,590
He's trying to take advantage
of magic only I can use.

305
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,090
He's been stalking me for all this time.

306
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,590
I don't want to be involved
in anything that’s bad.

307
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,550
But he's forcing me to, like he did earlier.

308
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:28,730
I don't know what I should do.

309
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,980
I'm sorry to bring this up so suddenly.

310
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,280
It's all right.
I'm totally gonna beat that guy up.

311
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,320
Oh no.
Please don't go out of your way.

312
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,540
No. He's definitely
getting beaten to a pulp.

313
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,000
Kind sir...

314
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,870
Hey!

315
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,760
Who's gonna beat who to a pulp?

316
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,630
Huh?

317
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,090
So you're the guy...

318
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,640
I'll be the one to kill you.

319
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,640
You look like the cringiest punk out there.

320
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:16,520
Whenever I come across a deluded loser
like you, I can't help but give them a dose of reality.

321
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:21,360
And when I do, what kind of look
will you have on your face?

322
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,400
Explomb!

323
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,500
Machine Gun Explomb!

324
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,260
I'm not done yet!

325
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,170
Oi oi oi oi!

326
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,720
Explomb!

327
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,440
Die twice!

328
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,440
<i>Meanwhile...</i>

329
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,650
- I'm so glad you’re with us.
- I’m so scared!

330
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,450
Let go.

331
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,120
Don't leave us!

332
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,500
- Please don't! No! Don't leave us!
- You’re the only one we can rely on!
<i>Anyway, is he doing all right?</i>

333
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:11,790
- Please don't! No! Don't leave us!
- You’re the only one we can rely on!

334
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,330
<i>It seems that second-year
was targeting him.</i>
- Please don't! No! Don't leave us!
- You’re the only one we can rely on!

335
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,290
<i>They haven’t run into each other, have they?</i>

336
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,590
Heh! You weren't much of anything!

337
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:32,100
Your puny magic
can't break through mine.

338
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,430
Got it!?

339
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:44,110
Hey hey, what's wrong now?
Where'd all that energy go?

340
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,360
You're gonna kill me, right?

341
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,410
Why don't you try a bit harder?

342
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,790
But it's no wonder!

343
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,120
Because even a moron can tell
the difference...

344
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,670
once they've seen the difference
in our skills!
