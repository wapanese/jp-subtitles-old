1
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,310
Karaage.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,670
The wafting steam,

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,520
the nose-tingling spices,

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,700
the plump chicken and the hot juices that course along your lips.

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:21,120
One of the cornerstones of the Japanese dinner table is about to become a weapon

6
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,790
in the ultimate fight for supremacy:

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,300
the Sumire Avenue Shopping District Summer Karaage Campaign.

8
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,850
Let's go check out enemy territory!

9
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,530
I doubt you'd ever manage to duplicate our recipe.

10
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:22,280
So if our shopping district were to come up
 with karaage that's better than yours,

11
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,200
it'd be a <i>huge</i> embarrassment
 to Mozuya-san, huh?

12
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,500
You talk big, <i>boy</i>,

13
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,670
but don't you kid yourself for a moment!

14
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,420
What could a mere child like you possibly do?

15
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,550
What's the best way to enjoy karaage?

16
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,270
Well, of course you'd want to eat it
right after it's been fried.

17
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:48,890
Right?

18
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,190
But that's simply not possible
 with Mozuya's karaage.

19
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,940
Huh?

20
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,900
What do you mean?

21
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,190
They sell their karaage in sealed plastic packaging,

22
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,610
so that customers taking the train won't bother other passengers with the smell.

23
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,620
They assume their product won't be eaten right away,
 but rather when the customers get home.

24
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,620
You can't eat karaage while you're walking around that nice mall at the station.

25
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,080
I see.

26
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,330
It's not like there's a food court there,

27
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,040
so they only have takeout.

28
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,800
But a shopping district doesn't
 have that kind of constraint.

29
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,510
Some shopping districts specifically capitalize on being able to eat while walking around.

30
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,470
Biting into piping hot karaage,
 straight out of the fryer.

31
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,100
That's how karaage <i>should</i> be eaten.

32
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,440
Not to mention, there are 
tons of schools around here,

33
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,100
from elementary schools to universities.

34
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:39,610
You're right. There's no reason for us to go head to head with them in the take-home food arena!

35
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,740
We should take advantage of our location instead!

36
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,410
That's exactly what we'll do!

37
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,450
Our keywords are...

38
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,240
Walk-n-Eat Karaage!

39
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,080
We'll have a fighting chance this way, won't we?

40
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,870
Yup!

41
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,670
I'm feeling it!

42
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,090
Souma-chan, I'll do my best
 to improve my recipes too!

43
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,970
I own a bento store, after all!

44
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,010
Let's defeat Mozuya together!

45
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,060
All right!

46
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,100
Let's do this!

47
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,690
S-Sure. Good luck with that.

48
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:23,930
We're Mozuya, the famous
 three-time consecutive champion

49
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,740
of the National Karaage Competition!

50
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,700
Come buy our special karaage today!

51
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,160
President Kinu, we've just received
 the consultant's invoice.

52
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,170
<i>Hmph.</i>

53
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,130
<i>I think that brat has outlived his usefulness.</i>

54
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,090
<i>There's no reason to keep paying
 his high consulting fees.</i>

55
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,010
Ma'am?

56
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,220
Oh, it's nothing.

57
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,970
<i>All Mozuya needs is our secret marinade.</i>

58
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,340
<i>We do owe the consultant for getting us a spot in this impregnable fortress of a station,</i>

59
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,730
<i>but this castle belongs to me now.</i>

60
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:02,570
<i>We'll just keep sittin' pretty and
 scarf down this town's money!</i>

61
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,450
Packaging to let people eat the goods right away...

62
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,330
Maybe toothpicks.

63
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,080
Kind of like this?

64
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,290
Reusing milk cartons?

65
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,460
Huh.

66
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,540
I went with karaage that elementary school students might like.

67
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,880
This one is seasoned with curry powder,

68
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,010
and this one is topped with
 powdered cheese that'll melt.

69
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,020
How are they?

70
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,610
They're delicious!

71
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,980
Both the curry and the cheese one!

72
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,110
But...

73
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,110
I think Mozuya's karaage was more satisfying.

74
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,950
So... I'm not sure this measures up.

75
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,580
I see.

76
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,790
The pieces have to be small if you want to fit them into a small carton or eat them with a toothpick.

77
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,840
It can't compete with Mozuya's meaty pieces.

78
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,840
The seasoning is pretty superficial too.

79
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,470
You have to capitalize on
 the quality of the ingredients.

80
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,140
Say, what if you put the pieces on a skewer?

81
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,390
That'd let people eat it using only one hand.

82
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,810
Well, karaage skewers are a dime a dozen,

83
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,440
so it might not have much visual impact.

84
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,440
That's true.

85
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,650
The packaging needs to be novel and eye-catching,

86
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,780
and the flavor of the karaage needs more work.

87
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,740
To make us competitive with Mozuya,
we need something that'll tick both boxes.

88
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,530
I know!

89
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,580
I have a notebook containing
 all the recipes I tried as a kid.

90
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,080
Let me go get it from my room!

91
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,460
<i>Yukihira-kun's room?</i>

92
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,590
<i>Yukihira's room.</i>

93
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,510
<i>Ah! He left us all by ourselves!</i>

94
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,010
<i>I-Is there anything we can talk about?!</i>

95
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:50,800
<i>Um... Um...</i>

96
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,680
U-Um, Mito-san!

97
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:53,600
Yeah?

98
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,060
Um, uh, h-how...

99
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,520
How is high school going?

100
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,150
Huh?

101
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,770
<i>Oh, no! That's not what I meant to ask!</i>

102
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,820
<i>I wanted to ask what
 Yukihira-kun's like in high school,</i>

103
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,700
<i>but I blurted out something that sounds like what a junior high school teacher would ask in a letter!</i>

104
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,320
Um, um...

105
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,990
<i>She knew Yukihira back in junior high, huh?</i>

106
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,990
You see, what I really meant to ask was...

107
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,910
Um... well...

108
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,700
<i>I guess that makes them childhood friends.</i>

109
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,950
So... uh...

110
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,120
Um... uh...

111
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,790
<i>Wait, why am I so irritated all of a sudden?!</i>

112
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,090
<i>Recover, Mayu! Recover!</i>

113
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,550
M-Mito-san, you're really amazing.

114
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,970
You're in the most rigorous
 culinary school in Japan.

115
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,050
I don't have any special talents.

116
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,930
It's no big deal.

117
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,640
Most people are just hopeless.

118
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,560
I know a real deadbeat too!

119
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,980
Man, just thinking about him
 gets my blood boiling!

120
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,480
What a useless waste of oxygen!

121
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,940
Become the don of the Don RS!

122
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,140
I... I see.

123
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,940
Well... still...

124
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,950
I guess Yukihira's not so bad, though.

125
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,290
<i>Does Mito-san have feelings for Yukihira-kun?</i>

126
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,370
U-Umâ€”

127
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,290
Oh, sorry.

128
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,860
You okay, Nikumi?

129
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,960
What the hell do you think 
you're doing, Yukihira?!

130
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,590
Sorry, I didn't mean...

131
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,300
Huh?!

132
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,340
<i>Maybe that was just my imagination.</i>

133
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,390
Wow, it's so much juicier than before!

134
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,560
Right?

135
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,230
Mozuya's karaage is made from breast meat,
 which is very lean and low in calories.

136
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,280
That'll be more popular with women, sure,

137
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,280
but if you want a rich flavor
 right out of the fryer,

138
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,030
you gotta go with thigh meat.

139
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,080
Yeah!

140
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,200
It's got volume and taste.

141
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,250
At joints that serve fried chicken,

142
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,540
thigh meat's really popular among children.

143
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,670
This'll be a great crowd-pleaser for students.

144
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,170
Nice! Good job, Meat Master!

145
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,010
No big deal.

146
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,130
<i>"Miito" Master?</i>

147
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,510
<i>Oh, it's a pun on Mito-san's name.</i>

148
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,390
Okay, next up is the marinade.

149
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,060
We'll use soy sauce and
 cayenne pepper as the base.

150
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,150
Oh, let's try using cornstarch this time.

151
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,020
Crap! I don't have any.

152
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,780
Oh, I'll go buy some!

153
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,690
Thanks.

154
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,280
<i>We started from scratch,</i>

155
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,870
<i>but now we're just full of ideas.</i>

156
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,080
<i>Those two are amazing!</i>

157
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,580
All right!

158
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,830
I'd say we have the seasoning figured out.

159
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,040
Yup!

160
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,640
We just have to decide how
 to serve it to our customers.

161
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,040
Souma-chan!

162
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,380
Chairman?

163
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,930
I snuck in from the back door.

164
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:36,510
Snuck in?

165
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,640
I've finished it!

166
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,140
I created the perfect dish
 for eating while walking!

167
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,520
It's a revolutionary idea that represents all the knowledge Tomitaya can offer!

168
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,890
Look!

169
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,610
This... is the karaage rice ball!

170
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,550
You can already buy this everywhere.

171
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,110
I've seen it in convenience stores.

172
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,400
I'm so embarrassed!

173
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,530
<i>What a blockhead!</i>

174
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,370
And I was so confident this would be a success.

175
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,040
I mean, karaage and rice are a match made in heaven, y'know?

176
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,800
<i>A way of serving karaage that's
 innovative, memorable, portable,</i>

177
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,510
<i>and able to enhance its taste.</i>

178
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,550
That's it, Chairman!

179
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,050
Huh?

180
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:18,840
This?

181
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,050
No, not that.

182
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,100
What you just said!

183
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,260
That'll work!

184
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,600
It'll be the key to our karaage!

185
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,560
The battle will begin tomorrow at sundown!

186
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,260
Hey!

187
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
Open up!

188
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,270
We need you to print a bunch of these ASAP!

189
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,780
Yes, chicken thigh meat.

190
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,650
I need it, and I need it bad!

191
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:42,780
Have it delivered to Toudou Butcher Shop in the Sumire Avenue Shopping District tomorrow at 5AM!

192
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,790
Sis, what're you doing?

193
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,250
Oh, Hiro-kun! Please help me with this!

194
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,250
<i>It'll be a sneak attack.</i>

195
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,920
<i>Right before dinnertime,</i>

196
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,210
<i>when the war for selling side dishes is at its peak,</i>

197
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,920
<i>we'll strike right at the enemy's heart</i>

198
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,220
<i>without giving them any chance
 to launch a counterattack!</i>

199
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,140
From the time we were in kindergarten,

200
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,260
Yukihira-kun would make disgusting bentos,

201
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,980
force them on his friends, and make them cry.

202
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,440
All right!

203
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,570
It's evening! Time to rake in the big bucks!

204
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,030
Training was tough today too.

205
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,780
I was already starving during practice.

206
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,860
What's that?

207
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,080
<i>Are those brats holding karaage?</i>

208
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,200
Nah, I must be mistaken.

209
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,420
There's no karaage more enticing
 to customers than ours.

210
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,380
Our business is safe.

211
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,920
Welcome!

212
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,340
Welcome!

213
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:44,140
Would you like to buy Mozuya's karaage?

214
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,230
What the hell's going on?!

215
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:56,020
There're a whole bunch of people in the station holding that thing with a mark!

216
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,320
How are our sales looking?!

217
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,490
I emailed the information to you, as usual.

218
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,070
They're holding steady, aren't they?

219
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,830
Well, receipts have been down
 twenty percent over the past two days.

220
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,830
No way!

221
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,910
You lot had better be providing
 proper customer service!

222
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,120
I'll beat you up if you're slacking in any way!

223
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,540
Excuse me.

224
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,170
Yes, yes, welcome!

225
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,590
Is this where you can get
 the Sumire Mark Karaage?

226
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,840
I... I believe that'd be in the shopping district in front of the station.

227
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,220
Oh, really?

228
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,350
The shopping district, huh?

229
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,760
Thank you for the information.

230
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,770
Want to get something for dinner at Mozuya?

231
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,440
What? I want the Sumire Mark karaage.

232
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,110
Hm, okay. Let's go!

233
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,560
Yay!

234
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,280
<i>Customers are passing us by?!</i>

235
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,740
How humiliating!

236
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,070
Um, perhaps we should call <i>him</i>
 and tell him what'sâ€”

237
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,950
We can't rely on that brat, idiot!

238
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,540
<i>I'm going to see for myself 
what's happening on Sumire Avenue!</i>

239
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,670
<i>This place was a ghost town just three days ago!</i>

240
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,880
How can this be possible?!

241
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,130
One, please!

242
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:04,840
I want one too!

243
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,720
Me too!

244
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,090
I'd also like one!

245
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,430
I'll have three!

246
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,600
Thank you!

247
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,180
Please wait a moment!

248
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,060
Need a re-up here!

249
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,270
Got it!

250
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,770
Coming right up!

251
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:22,190
<i>We left large pieces of thigh meat to soak in our original marinade based on soy sauce and cayenne pepper.</i>

252
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,270
Breaded and ready!

253
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,360
Thanks!

254
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,610
Man, the anticipation is killing me!

255
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,960
I can't wait to dig in.

256
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,340
<i>And...</i>

257
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,760
<i>after frying it once to cook the meat,</i>

258
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,340
<i>we fry it a second time to crisp up the surface.</i>

259
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:54,270
<i>Then we put it in a special wrap
 along with herbs and leaf lettuce.</i>

260
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,770
<i>Add an extra hit of flavor
 with our special chili fish sauce,</i>

261
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,270
<i>as well as a dash of black pepper.</i>

262
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,020
Here you go!

263
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,860
Enjoy the Sumire Mark Karaage Roll!

264
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,740
Wow, it looks really filling!

265
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,240
It's still sizzling!

266
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,740
It looks delicious!

267
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,330
The chicken's really plump and juicy!

268
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,540
The fried chicken is crispy in parts and tender where the sauce has soaked in.

269
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,550
The way all the different flavors mingle between the juicy meat,

270
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,710
the black pepper, and the vegetables...

271
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,680
Yummy!

272
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,140
Delicious.

273
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,180
I want one!

274
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,500
Give me two, boy!

275
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,120
I want three!

276
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,980
Mommy, I want to try it.

277
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,480
Sure!

278
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,110
Oh.

279
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,810
Tomita-san, cover the fryer for a sec!

280
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:45,320
Whaâ€”

281
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,070
What?!

282
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,320
Hey, Souma-chan!

283
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,030
<i>What's it being wrapped in?</i>

284
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,740
<i>A crepe?</i>

285
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,620
<i>Or a tortilla like they use for tacos?</i>

286
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,000
<i>I have no idea.</i>

287
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,460
Well, well! If it isn't Mozuya-san!

288
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,690
There's no need to skulk about.

289
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,710
Why not line up with pride?

290
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,710
H-How long have you been at this?

291
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,550
Huh?

292
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,260
About three days.

293
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,510
What?!

294
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,430
The hardware store provided
 the kitchen equipment.

295
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,770
The sheet metal store crafted the Sumire Mark branding iron.

296
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,270
The grocer and butcher supplied
 us with the ingredients.

297
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,730
And the printer made the flyers and the packaging.

298
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,650
Everything was made here in the shopping district.

299
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,030
In a single night.

300
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,240
Who'd like ice-cold beer to go
 with that karaage roll?!

301
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,700
We're selling taiyaki at a discount right now!

302
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,160
We have cold ramune here!

303
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,620
Try our new dish!

304
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,040
Free dessert with each meal!

305
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,960
Beer with this karaage? How sinful!

306
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,960
It's like a festival!

307
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,550
Mister, please give me one of those.

308
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,520
I'll have a beer.

309
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,130
<i>What in the world?</i>

310
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,010
<i>With the karaage....</i>

311
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,140
<i>No, with this brat at the center,</i>

312
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,890
<i>the entire shopping district
 is coming back to life!</i>

313
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,310
<i>I underestimated him.</i>

314
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,310
<i>This brat's an extraordinary tactician!</i>

315
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,770
<i>He laid siege to Mozuya in an instant,</i>

316
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:11,240
<i>just like Sunomata Castle that
 Hideyoshi built in a single night!</i>

317
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,240
Remember what you said, Mozuya-san?

318
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,950
A place with no competitiveness or
 creativity deserves to die out, right?

319
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,210
Well, this place has it.

320
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:24,460
Our shopping district has what it takes!

321
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,590
Quit your yapping!

322
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,980
Who gives a shit about your karaage?!

323
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,060
Mozuya will crush you soon enoughâ€”

324
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,300
Come on, what's with that kind of talk?

325
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,520
Try it for yourself, Auntie!

326
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,470
It's really good, seriously!

327
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,930
This is none of your business!

328
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:42,020
And don't call me "Auntie"!

329
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,520
They're right, you know.

330
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,480
You let us try your karaage last time.

331
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,780
Why don't you give ours a shot?

332
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,740
Here's one. Dig in!

333
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,790
<i>This wrap...</i>

334
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,120
<i>is made from rice flour!</i>

335
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,460
<i>I see. This is similar to bÃ¡nh xÃ¨o!</i>

336
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:13,380
BÃ¡nh xÃ¨o is a Vietnamese dish.

337
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,970
A thin batter made of ingredients such as
rice flour, water, and coconut milk is cooked,

338
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,820
then stuffed with ingredients such as pork, shrimp, and bean sprouts.

339
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,600
<i>I get it now.</i>

340
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,020
<i>This is based on the idea</i>

341
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,110
<i>that piping hot rice and juicy karaage are a match made in heaven.</i>

342
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,530
<i>The pairing was reimagined,</i>

343
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:39,870
<i>then further strengthened by improving its portability, taste, and visual impact!</i>

344
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,460
<i>Students on their way home from club practice...</i>

345
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,420
<i>Mothers rushing home to get dinner on the table...</i>

346
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,380
<i>Commuters enjoying a break...</i>

347
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,590
<i>The hustle and bustle of
 the city are strangely relaxing.</i>

348
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,260
<i>This karaage...</i>

349
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,560
<i>This ambiance...</i>

350
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:09,350
<i>They invoke something far more brilliant than profits and returns.</i>

351
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,070
<i>In this final match, it's the bottom of the ninth,</i>

352
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,770
<i>with two outs and bases loaded.</i>

353
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,990
<i>The pitcher winds up! Here's the pitch!</i>

354
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,420
<i>This... is the taste of youth!</i>

355
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,590
Glad you liked it!

356
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,390
Nikumi, you're really awesome!

357
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,850
That marinade was super helpful.

358
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,520
I hope you'll teach me
 a lot more from now on!

359
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,900
S-Sure, if I'm free.

360
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,610
<i>I envy Mito-san.</i>

361
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,780
<i>After tonight, I won't get to spend any more time with Yukihira-kun.</i>

362
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,020
Kurase!

363
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,120
Um, it's up to you, but...

364
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,990
Y-Yes?

365
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,620
Can you help Tomitaya out part-time?

366
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What?!

367
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,340
We just have to hang on till
 the karaage rolls stick, y'know?

368
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,510
But it'll be a little shaky if we 
just rely on Tomita-san,

369
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,590
and I can't be around most of the time.

370
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,050
B-But I've never worked a job.

371
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,600
There must be someone better suited toâ€”

372
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,720
Is there?

373
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,390
I thought I could depend on you,
 because I know you're a responsible person.

374
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,230
What?

375
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:36,020
In junior high, you'd work really late doing class council stuff.

376
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,080
Even in elementary school,

377
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,530
you never skipped watering
 the flowers when it was your turn.

378
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,280
I'd feel a lot better if you were here.

379
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,120
<i>I always thought that he was out of reach...</i>

380
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,120
<i>but he was paying attention to me?</i>

381
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,480
Well, I won't force youâ€”

382
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,920
I'll... give it a try!

383
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,090
Really?

384
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,260
You're a lifesaver!

385
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,130
I'll come by sometimes to air out Yukihira,

386
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,800
so you should drop by.

387
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,010
I'll cook for you.

388
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,100
O-Okay!

389
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,100
<i>Yay!</i>

390
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,520
Huh?

391
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,850
What's the matter, Nikumi?

392
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,640
Nothing...

393
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,020
<i>It's great to be young.</i>

394
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,690
One here too.

395
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,570
Me too.

396
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,030
I've never felt so satisfied before!

397
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,110
I want to try it.

398
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,900
So that's the Sumire Mark Karaage Roll.

399
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,660
What's the verdict?

400
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,240
Here!

401
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,830
I give it twenty...

402
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,000
out of ten!

403
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,420
Sales have plummeted three days in a row.

404
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,880
Well, Mozuya-san?

405
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,840
What do you have to say for yourself?

406
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:16,730
Well, so much for vacation.
 It was over in a flash.

407
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,150
Who the hell are you guys?

408
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,380
Yukihira Souma, right?

409
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,610
You're coming with us.

410
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,910
There you are.

411
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,330
And who're you?

412
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,790
The Sumire Mark Karaage Roll wasn't a bad idea.

413
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,380
I'm the one who orchestrated
 Mozuya's Tokyo expansion.

414
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,800
And not just Mozuya.

415
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,350
Since junior high,

416
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:55,430
I've offered consulting services to over 500 businesses
 in the food industry and led each of them to success.

417
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:59,520
I heard about how you revived
 the shopping district.

418
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,730
Thanks to you, my record has been spoiled.

419
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,520
So you want to beat me up now, is that it?

420
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,440
No.

421
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,150
Come work for me.

422
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,060
I'll make sure you never go hungry.

423
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:16,080
I already have a goal: 
to carry on my family restaurant.

424
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,910
I have no plans to work for anyone else.

425
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,130
To be honest, I didn't think
 you'd accept my offer.

426
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,550
You're like everyone else.

427
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,970
Huh?

428
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,950
You're trapped in your own little world.

429
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,300
As long as you can pretend to be a professional, you're satisfied.

430
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,310
Your restaurant's small-time, isn't it?

431
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:40,140
Is your ambition so limited because you were born into that kind of place?

432
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,340
Well?

433
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,060
You talk big,

434
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,690
but you're a chef too, aren't you?

435
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,520
I am not.

436
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,820
What I am is the one whom all the chefs obey.

437
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,990
I've set my sights on an entirely different stage.

438
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,700
Yukihira Souma,

439
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:00,910
allow me to inform you that you've been chosen for the Autumn Selection.

440
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,920
But don't rejoice just yet.

441
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,960
The Selection will mark the end
 of your upward trajectory.

442
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,430
I'll make you pay for staining my career.

443
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,810
Those who know of me call me...

444
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,270
the Alchemist!

445
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:24,310
I'm the ninth seat of the Tohtsuki Elite Ten,

446
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,730
Eizan Etsuya.

447
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:32,320
I'll crush you on the best stage possible.

448
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:42,790
Next time, at Bento Shop Tomitaya... No, wait!

449
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,300
...on <i>Shokugeki no Souma</i>,

450
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,000
the nineteenth dish:

451
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,550
The Chosen One.

452
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,010
It's so delicious, Yukihira-kun!

453
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,840
I'll do my best at work today!
