1
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,940
will emerge from those who survive the preliminaries.

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,990
Of the sixty participants in the preliminaries,

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,200
only the four highest-ranked candidates from

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,530
Groups A and B will advance to the main tournament!

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,120
That'll be just eight people in all!

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,000
28 points!

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,250
31 points!

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,080
6 points!

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,420
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,750
<i>All the dishes have been very refined too!</i>

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,420
Sadatsuka Nao, 84 points!

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,970
So what will Arato Hisako's score be?

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,180
92 points!

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,850
Finally, a score in the 90's!

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,640
No surprise there! She's been
 acknowledged by Erina-sama as a chef!

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,610
Next up to present a dish is Houjou Miyoko!

17
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,900
How will the judges score her dish?

18
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,610
Here we go!

19
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,570
87 points!

20
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,160
She has pushed Sadatsuka Nao
 aside to take second place!

21
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,620
Fragrant with both spices and pineapple,

22
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,000
her pineapple curry fried rice 
is surely unforgettable!

23
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,800
The sweetness of the fruit and the savoriness of the stir-fried rice fill your mouth.

24
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,130
It's an experience not unlike sweet-and-sour pork,

25
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,970
another Chinese dish made with pineapple.

26
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,600
The dish was finished by placing the stir-fried rice into half a hollowed out pineapple,

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,270
capping it with the other half as a lid,

28
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,850
and then baking it in the oven.

29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,690
She salted the interior of the pineapple to
 control how sweet the rice would become.

30
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,990
That allowed her to impart just
 the refreshing fragrance of the fruit

31
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,570
to the rice and also prevent 
the dish from drying out.

32
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,330
This dish is an advancement in Chinese cuisine.

33
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,410
Invincible and indomitable.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
She is like a kung fu master
 cloaked in a dragon of flame!

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,880
She is the Iron Fire Dragon Girl!

36
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,010
Unsurprisingly, she's heir to the oldest dining establishment in Chinatown.

37
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,090
This dish is something that puts men to shame!

38
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,680
Or should I say blows them away?!

39
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,930
Wow, I had no idea you could turn curry into something like that.

40
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,490
Hurry! The judging's about to begin!

41
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,280
Yeah.

42
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,500
I bet there's a huge uproar in here tooâ€”

43
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,120
Huh?

44
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,260
What on earth just happened?

45
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,760
It's way too quiet.

46
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,510
Huh?!

47
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,470
Zero points?!

48
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,970
What the hell?!

49
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,140
How is that even possible?

50
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,270
86 points!

51
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,770
Talk about a dark horse candidate!

52
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,230
Candidate Yoshino Yuuki has
 leapt into third place!

53
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,740
The current rankings have
 Candidate Arato leading

54
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,740
by a wide margin at 92 points,

55
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,030
with Candidate Houjou in second place,

56
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,830
Candidate Yoshino in third place,

57
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,410
and Candidate Sadatsuka in fourth place.

58
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,860
Wow, I must say!

59
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,590
Your wild game curry was delicious beyond my wildest dreams!

60
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,300
Thank you!

61
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,640
Starting with the stock you made by sauteeing spices in duck fat,

62
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,680
your dish was saturated
 with the essence of duck.

63
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,600
One would expect the dish
 to be way too gamy,

64
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,810
but somehow you gave it a bright, clean taste!

65
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,480
Yet it retains a unique, wild flavor!

66
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,520
And to top it all off,

67
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,480
you literally topped it with a fried duck cutlet!

68
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,240
The gaminess was ameliorated by the flavors of turmeric and orange.

69
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,830
In French cuisine, it's traditional to pair duck with a sauce made from oranges.

70
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,040
Exactly!

71
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,330
I added orange pulp and zest
 into the roux as well.

72
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,830
They pair well with my custom
 garam masala mix!

73
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,210
<i>I see.</i>

74
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,760
<i>Autumn is the season for game meat, that's for sure.</i>

75
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,050
<i>But acquiring such high-quality
 game in time for these prelims</i>

76
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,760
<i>requires good connections with hunters.</i>

77
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,220
Miss...

78
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,230
I'll invite you to my gourmet club next time!

79
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,810
Oh, really?

80
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,770
How generous of you!

81
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,730
Think nothing of it!

82
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,320
<i>Is it her natural good cheer that changes people?</i>

83
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,820
Yuuki, your cheerful, open 
smile attracts everyone,

84
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,990
and your cooking pierces
 right through people's hearts.

85
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,910
One might call you...

86
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,660
the Little Red Riding Hood 
of the Forest of Wild Beasts!

87
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,880
And now, it's time!

88
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,050
The highly anticipated 
sibling face-off in Group B!

89
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,670
The Aldini Brothers!

90
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,840
First up is the younger
 Aldini, Candidate Isami!

91
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,340
I'll be going on ahead.

92
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,720
Yeah.

93
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,100
Please, do dig in before it gets cold.

94
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,850
Oh!

95
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,890
Is this a calzone?

96
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,360
A calzone is pizza dough folded in half and stuffed with a filling.

97
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,820
They can be baked or fried and can be found in a variety of forms throughout Italy.

98
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,120
They typically contain mozzarella cheese and other pizza toppings, don't they?

99
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,740
That means...

100
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,720
Ah!

101
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,290
There's curry inside!

102
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,170
So this is something like 
an Italian version of curry bread?

103
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,090
It's rather different from the previous dishes we've had. Very interesting!

104
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,760
Well, let's dig in.

105
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,050
Splash!

106
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,140
T-Tomatoes?

107
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,600
The curry's overflowing with the rich, 
juicy flavor of tomatoes!

108
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,980
Inside the calzone is a curry that was made primarily with tomatoes.

109
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,440
Oh, you didn't add stock or
any other liquids to the curry?

110
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,650
Right.

111
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,650
If you heat tightly packed tomatoes
at the bottom of a pot,

112
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,910
they release a surprising amount of liquid.

113
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,580
I added a special spice mix that pairs well with the tomatoes' acidity.

114
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,920
It resulted in a rich curry that's
 full of the tomato's umami.

115
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,380
As for the dough,

116
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,920
I used the grape yeast our family makes.

117
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,670
<i>The surface is so light and crisp!</i>

118
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,090
<i>Yet when you bite into it, it's chewy and sweet.</i>

119
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,430
<i>It's a perfect match for the rich curry.</i>

120
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,220
Wonderful!

121
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,590
You re-imagined curry bread as Italian cuisine

122
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,810
and created something 
completely new in the process!

123
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,560
<i>"The pitiable younger brother, forever doomed to sit in the shadow cast by his older brother."</i>

124
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,820
<i>Many have thought of Isami Aldini that way.</i>

125
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,530
<i>But that's not the truth.</i>

126
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,950
<i>He too is an explorer in a foreign land,</i>

127
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,080
<i>pursuing new culinary horizons on his own.</i>

128
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,960
<i>This time I will defeat Bro for sure!</i>

129
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,750
Isami's score is 87 points!

130
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,050
He's now in second place!

131
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,650
He got the same score as Houjou!

132
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,050
That means Sadatsuka Nao won't make it into the main tournament.

133
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,160
She's laughing for some strange reason.

134
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,810
Was falling to fifth place that big of a shock?

135
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,770
Hisako-onee-sama...

136
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,520
Such a tight race!

137
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,230
What passion! How fitting for
 a gourmet food festival!

138
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,360
And now, it's Candidate Takumi Aldini's turn!

139
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,570
Buon appetito.

140
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,570
Oh?

141
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,530
So it's a pasta dish now?

142
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,570
I guess we're getting Italian cuisine twice in a row.

143
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,740
Bacon, green bell peppers, and mushrooms.

144
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,370
It looks like spaghetti Napolitan,

145
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,210
but he used curry as the sauce instead of ketchup.

146
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,880
The pasta's shaped like fettuccine.

147
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,430
Otherwise, nothing really stands out.

148
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,220
Hm...

149
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,970
Next to the novel calzone we just had,

150
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,850
this doesn't look very promisingâ€”

151
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,060
<i>Wh-What?!</i>

152
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,850
<i>What is this rich depth of flavor?</i>

153
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,810
<i>It has struck me to the very core of my being!</i>

154
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,500
<i>The stock was made from beef flank and chicken</i>

155
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,070
<i>and seasoned with fennel and green cardamom.</i>

156
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,490
<i>The curry sauce tickles one's
nostrils in a delightful manner!</i>

157
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,120
<i>It coats the thick noodles well!</i>

158
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,370
What?!

159
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,580
The secret ingredient is soy sauce?

160
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,120
No.

161
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,950
It's tamari soy sauce.

162
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,600
It's manufactured primarily in the Tokai region.

163
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,340
It has a more concentrated
 umami than regular soy sauce,

164
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,010
while still retaining a sweet, mellow flavor.

165
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,930
But where is this mild cheese flavor coming from?

166
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,680
It's quite simple.

167
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,550
Please look more closely at the pasta.

168
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,020
Wh-What's this?

169
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,600
The pasta has three layers!

170
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,150
I incorporated turmeric in the outer layers,

171
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,770
and Parmesan cheese in the middle layer.

172
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,190
I see!

173
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,680
The tamari soy sauce and Parmesan
 combine to create this much depth.

174
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,870
S-Still, with the cheese in the dough,

175
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,460
the heat from boiling the pasta wouldâ€”

176
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,870
<i>So that's why there are </i>three<i> layers!</i>

177
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,540
<i>By sandwiching the cheese between two layers,</i>

178
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,670
<i>he prevented the cheese from melting and leaking out!</i>

179
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:14,050
<i>The curry sauce's depth of flavor is enhanced by the tamari soy sauce.</i>

180
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,880
<i>And when you bite into it,</i>

181
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,340
<i>the rich flavor of the Parmesan cheese spreads in your mouth, delivering a final blow!</i>

182
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,310
<i>Marinating cream cheese in soy sauce is a well-known technique,</i>

183
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,060
<i>but who would've guessed that Parmesan and tamari soy sauce would pair so well?</i>

184
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:33,570
Italian and Japanese cuisine have achieved a new harmony within the format of this curry dish!

185
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,650
Takumi Aldini...

186
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:42,160
He is yet another pioneer of the culinary world!

187
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,010
<i>They're both skilled chefs,</i>

188
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,830
<i>but maybe Takumi is a tad more sophisticated.</i>

189
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:54,550
<i>I'd like my main course to be made by Takumi today. Is that all right?</i>

190
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,050
<i>I can do that too!</i>

191
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,340
<i>Isami!</i>

192
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,550
<i>Why did you alter a finished dish?!</i>

193
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,300
<i>What you did diluted its taste.</i>

194
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,560
<i>Do you want us to lose our customers' trust?!</i>

195
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,270
<i>Bro, I'm sorry.</i>

196
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,820
<i>I ruined your cooking.</i>

197
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,070
<i>I wanted to show them that I'm just as good.</i>

198
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,570
<i>I didn't want to become a burden to Takumi.</i>

199
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,830
<i>Mezzaluna...</i>

200
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,370
<i>The blade named for the half-moon.</i>

201
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,710
<i>Don't you think it's perfect for us?</i>

202
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,050
<i>When two halves of a whole come together, 
perfection is born.</i>

203
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,380
<i>Aldini needs both of us, Isami!</i>

204
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,140
<i>I will move forward with every step you take.</i>

205
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:51,730
<i>One day, our restaurant will
 become the best in all of Italy!</i>

206
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,850
<i>Buon giorno!</i>

207
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,860
<i>Welcome to Trattoria Aldini!</i>

208
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,980
<i>Ciao, Aldini brothers!</i>

209
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,610
<i>Let us have the best possible meal today too!</i>

210
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,570
<i>We're counting on you!</i>

211
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,410
<i>He's an everyday sort of guy you can always tease,</i>

212
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,670
<i>but he becomes a totally different person once he puts on his chef's coat.</i>

213
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,410
<i>Guess I couldn't catch up with him today, either.</i>

214
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,290
My brother sure is amazing.

215
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,300
Takumi Aldini's score is 90 points!

216
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,790
Grazie!

217
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,130
Whoa!

218
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,180
Another score in the nineties!

219
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,510
He surpassed Houjou!

220
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,770
Group B is in the final stretch!

221
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,060
And with that, we only haveâ€”

222
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,040
Here you go!

223
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,690
<i>She didn't wait for my announcement!</i>

224
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,360
<i>Hey, don't you dare ignore me, you bitch!</i>

225
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,820
I just got tired of waiting!

226
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,450
Wh-What is this?!

227
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,700
You've got to be kidding.

228
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,200
Is that really food?

229
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,870
I put a lot of effort into this.

230
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,960
Please enjoy.

231
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,790
The twins on the box 
are us two.

232
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,340
Nostalgic, isn't it?

233
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,210
That picture was 
taken back in the 90's.

234
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,880
I think they can work 
out how old we are.

235
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,970
Maybe we should 
change the packaging?

236
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,970
Huh? J-Just what is this dish?

237
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,640
Is that really curry?

238
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,600
Is that amazing arch a garnish?

239
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,980
The sauce is a weird green color too.

240
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,190
I don't see the roux anywhere.

241
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,150
Oh, will you listen to yourself?

242
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:28,030
<i>Everything</i> on this dish is curry.

243
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,970
What's going on?

244
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,590
The judges had so much to say until now,

245
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,750
but now they're frozen in place!

246
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,190
U-Um...

247
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,300
How does it taste?

248
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:50,220
Um, I'm not sure how to describe this.

249
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,890
There's warmth... and something cold.

250
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:57,630
The veterans of gourmet are all tongue-tied.

251
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,860
Does that mean that dish is beyond even their comprehension?

252
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,440
The curry sauce is foamy and ever so slightly warm.

253
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,160
It melts in your mouth.

254
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,700
The tomato mousse is c-cold, and...

255
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,830
After I added the spices,

256
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,870
I solidified it with sodium alginate.

257
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,540
Huh?

258
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,670
Before you is a frozen mousse made from turmeric and powdered foie gras.

259
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,920
The white object in the center is a puree of potatoes and six types of cheese.

260
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,300
Its ingredients have been flash-frozen,

261
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,680
so it will melt in your mouth.

262
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,770
Once you feel its coldness inside your mouth, enjoy the flaky pie crust.

263
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,690
Flavored with coriander and other spices,

264
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,400
the pie crust will cleanse your palate.

265
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,180
"Thermal sense."

266
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,400
It's one of the themes of molecular gastronomy:

267
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,880
a dish composed of different elements at contrasting temperatures.

268
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,570
This dish embodies that theme.

269
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:55,790
S-So, then... does it taste good?

270
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,580
Of course it's delicious!

271
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:04,000
But I don't have the words to express how delicious it is in full!

272
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,960
Not even a gifted writer can describe how it tastes?

273
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,800
With spices at its core,

274
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,470
this dish manipulates texture and
 temperature and makes them shine.

275
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,930
It revolutionizes the entire field of cooking!

276
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,430
Indeed, if I were to give her a title,

277
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,020
she would be a Global Innovator!

278
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,610
N-Ninety-five points?!

279
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:31,030
Nakiri Alice has received the highest
number of points and is now in the lead!

280
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,120
Oh, not 100 points?

281
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,040
How unexpected.

282
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,740
But, I suppose...

283
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,890
Look, I received higher marks than Secretary-chan.

284
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,500
Wh-Who are you calling Secretary-chan?!

285
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,760
Wow!

286
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,170
Every judge gave her 19 points!

287
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,500
That's almost a perfect score!

288
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,750
I can't believe those gourmands would do that.

289
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,670
I haven't seen such a high score in a long time.

290
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,580
Candidate Nakiri Alice is in first place,

291
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,810
followed by Candidate Arato,
 then Candidate Takumi.

292
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:00,430
Candidates Houjou and Isami
 are tied for fourth place!

293
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,900
Only four may advance from
Group B to the main tournament!

294
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,230
It's time for the judges to decide,

295
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,070
"Who will advance to the main tournament?"

296
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,440
Well!

297
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,530
That dish was quite interesting,
and certainly made for a fitting end!

298
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,490
Indeed.

299
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,800
Adjudicating the top dishes was a difficult task.

300
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,870
As usual, this year was a close contest.

301
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,830
And on that note, let's proceed with the voting.

302
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,160
Excuse me...

303
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,420
M-My curry... is still waiting.

304
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,210
<i>She's the one who butchered the monkfish.</i>

305
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,510
Huh?

306
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,630
She was still here?

307
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,720
<i>Ugh, and here we were all
 revved up for the finale.</i>

308
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,830
I'm sorry!

309
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,730
So sorry!

310
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,560
Here it comes!

311
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,440
It's Megumi's turn!

312
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,230
Megumi!

313
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,770
Everyone?

314
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,260
What'cha doin' here?

315
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,610
We left fishin' to the young 'uns today.

316
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,700
We wanted to see you up on the big stage!

317
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,160
O-Oh, ya shouldn't have.

318
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:05,050
Hey, I guess those scary guys really like her.

319
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,380
Who is Tadokoro Megumi, really?

320
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,080
All right, Candidate Tadokoro,
 hurry up and come forward.

321
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,920
Oh!

322
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,270
Go on, Megumi!

323
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,300
Show 'em what ya got!

324
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,210
Yeah!

325
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,100
Okay!

326
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,060
<i>P-Please teach me!</i>

327
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,770
<i>I want to help at home!</i>

328
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,600
<i>Please!</i>

329
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,690
<i>I'm begging you!</i>

330
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,410
It's monkfish dobu-jiru curry!

331
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,980
Dobu-jiru...

332
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,370
That's a hot pot dish with monkfish as the main ingredient, no?

333
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,540
Correct.

334
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,840
It's a dish that has been passed down by fishermen
 of the Ibaraki and Fukushima prefectures for generations.

335
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,000
<i>Monkfish in curry?</i>

336
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,880
<i>Just what is she thinking?</i>

337
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,800
Whew...

338
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:02,090
I see. So this is why you used monkfish.

339
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:07,600
The main characteristic of dobu-jiru hot pot is that 
monkfish liver is sauteed and rendered into a paste.

340
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,610
Miso and sake are added to the liver to form the base of the broth.

341
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,530
However, this girl also added spices to that mix,

342
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,780
effectively creating a liver curry miso paste.

343
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,280
The deliciousness just seeps
 into you. How addictive!

344
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,790
The unctuous, deep flavor of the liver is
 a surprisingly good complement to the spices!

345
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,330
Still, I must say,

346
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,340
after the previous dish, it's all the more apparent to me that...

347
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,210
How should I put it?

348
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,710
It's a very <i>human</i> dish.

349
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:39,300
The ingredients are monkfish meat, skin, fin, and...

350
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:39,840
Hm?

351
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:45,520
Kogiku kabocha squash, Tachikawa burdock root, and Akasuji daikon!

352
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,480
Y-Yes!

353
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,980
They're all ingredients that
 are local to my hometown.

354
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,980
I wanted to highlight their strengths,
 so I've been experimenting a lot.

355
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,490
Curry is very assertive,

356
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,740
so it was hard to blend it with the sweetness and bitterness of other vegetables.

357
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,330
But I realized I could use dobu-jiru with 
monkfish liver to take advantage of the spices.

358
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:10,080
The broth could then bridge the gap between them and the flavor of the vegetables.

359
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,830
I wanted to make the kind of curry

360
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:16,670
where you can almost experience
 how it feels to be in my hometown!

361
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:17,960
<i>What?</i>

362
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,510
<i>Megumi really made this?</i>

363
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,090
<i>Yes!</i>

364
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,990
<i>No one here can beat her at cooking any more!</i>

365
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:30,060
<i>I've heard that there's a famous
 culinary school in Tokyo.</i>

366
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,520
<i>Would you like to go?</i>

367
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,190
<i>What?</i>

368
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,100
<i>I hear many of their graduates go on to awe the world.</i>

369
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:42,780
<i>B-But Mom, I want to help out at this inn when I'm done with school.</i>

370
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,910
<i>If that's your final decision, that's fine.</i>

371
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,250
<i>I'd be happy to have you here.</i>

372
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:53,820
<i>But before you make that choice,</i>

373
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,780
<i>I want you to catch a glimpse
 of a bigger world, at least once.</i>

374
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,050
What?!

375
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,910
How can Megumi's dish only score in the teens?!

376
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,930
I told ya already!

377
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,500
The five judges' scores all add 
up to a hundred, old man!

378
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,560
Good job!

379
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,310
That's our Megumi!

380
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,070
<i>Here, a good luck charm to help you stay focused on your studies.</i>

381
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,070
<i>Tokyo, huh?</i>

382
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,160
<i>It'll get lonely around here.</i>

383
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,080
<i>However, we can't let Megumi's talent go to waste.</i>

384
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,540
<i>Good luck, Megumi!</i>

385
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:34,250
<i>Megumi might become the biggest fish to come outta these parts!</i>

386
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,670
<i>Megumi...</i>

387
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,090
<i>How's school?</i>

388
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,500
<i>Mom, um...</i>

389
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,470
<i>It's going fine.</i>

390
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,430
<i>I'm having a lot of fun in my classes!</i>

391
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:51,440
<i>Megumi, you're pretty amazing, y'know?</i>

392
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,110
<i>Do you want to come practice cooking again?</i>

393
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,920
<i>We'll keep you company.</i>

394
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,110
<i>Oh, it's okay!</i>

395
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,150
<i>Thanks for the offer.</i>

396
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,610
<i>But I think I'll practice on my own today.</i>

397
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,130
Your time's finally come, Tadokoro-chan.

398
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,620
It's time for you to leave the
 tiny world you started off in...

399
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,420
and soar into the sky.

400
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,840
Candidate Tadokoro Megumi has 88 points!

401
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,960
She's in fourth place!

402
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,220
She passed the preliminaries!

403
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,230
Houjou Miyoko didn't make it
 out of the preliminaries!

404
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,150
This is a major upset!

405
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,730
Megumi! You did it!

406
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,700
Megumi!

407
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,840
Megumi!

408
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,950
Megumi!

409
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,780
Megumi!

410
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,500
<i>I thought I'd have to overpower the men to succeed.</i>

411
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,580
<i>But with the way I am now...</i>

412
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,760
<i>is that just a pipe dream?</i>

413
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,310
Okay, this is no good at all.

414
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,270
How could I possibly score a dish like this?

415
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:45,360
U-Um, wh-what is the score?

416
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,020
Didn't you hear me the first time?

417
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,320
I said it's no good.

418
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:53,950
Th-The total is 19 points.

419
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:58,370
Sendawara Natsume keeps awarding zero points to each dish.

420
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,750
She's already judged more than ten candidates,

421
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,910
and she's yet to give even a single point.

422
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:05,250
All the dishes looked pretty good too.

423
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,800
Wh-What the hell's going on here?

424
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,920
Maybe the judges for Group A
 are way more strict.

425
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,260
V-Very well, n-next up is
 Candidate Kurokiba Ryou!

426
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,040
Come on up, please!

427
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,000
Next time on <i>Shokugeki no Souma</i>,

428
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,410
the twenty-third dish.

429
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,540
Ryou-kun, say something already!

430
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,950
The Competition of the Blossoming Individuals.

431
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,910
I will be the one at the top!

432
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,760
Isn't that a bit much?

433
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,850
No way.

434
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,910
It's how these things go.
