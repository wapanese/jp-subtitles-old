1
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,980
<i>I</i> am the chef here.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:11,110
Underlings like you have no right to make changes to <i>my</i> recette!

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,440
Tadokoro Megumi.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:14,990
You're fired.

5
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:17,870
Cooking Battle.

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,450
If I beat you in a Cooking Battle,

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,960
will you rescind Tadokoro's expulsion?

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,880
A Cooking Battle?

9
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,220
Now <i>that</i> brings back memories!

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,140
What the hell is the transfer student thinking?

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,720
He'll be up against an alumnus,

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,510
a former first seat of the Elite Ten at that!

13
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:47,100
Plus, Chef Shinomiya is a seasoned veteran from the front lines of the culinary world!

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,440
A Cooking Battle with an opponent who's not currently a student is not without precedent.

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,320
But it <i>does</i> require the consent 
of both parties, doesn't it?

16
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,820
I'm afraid that I have no intention
 of accepting your challenge.

17
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,620
There is nothing you can do.

18
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,720
Tadokoro Megumi's expulsion is final—

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,330
Well, let's not be too hasty.

20
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:08,710
Looks like you have quite an interesting situation developing here, Shinomiya.

21
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,540
Doujima-san?

22
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,100
Hm, I see.

23
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,400
Tadokoro Megumi-san's dish is delicious!

24
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,650
Why not just let her pass?

25
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,770
You're so stubborn, Shinomiya-senpai!

26
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,070
How mule-headed!

27
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,200
Narcissist!

28
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,370
Poser!

29
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,950
Shut up, Hinako.

30
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,870
S-Sorry.

31
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,170
It hurts.

32
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,630
Doujima-san, I believe I was given full discretion for this task.

33
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,920
Of course, Shinomiya.

34
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,970
I have no complaints about the nature of the task or your evaluation criteria.

35
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,220
However, she <i>did</i> try to deal 
with the situation at hand.

36
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,690
Don't you think her courage might merit a certain degree of consideration?

37
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,190
I don't.

38
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,390
Not in the least.

39
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,110
I do! Give her another chance!

40
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,650
Wow, it seems that we have a tie.

41
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,570
We are at an impasse.

42
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,360
You guys...

43
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,610
I'm left with no choice.

44
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,280
I'll oversee the unofficial Cooking Battle.

45
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,320
Think of it as a street brawl.

46
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,370
However, we cannot let it interfere with the training camp.

47
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,290
Once all the afternoon tasks are complete,

48
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,210
the two of you will face Shinomiya.

49
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,210
Hold on a minute, Doujima-san!

50
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,550
Why do I have to participate in this farce—

51
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,920
Just play along, Shinomiya.

52
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,390
Fine, fine.

53
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,850
I'll accede to Monsieur Doujima's whims.

54
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,720
Okay, Yukihira.

55
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,480
If you win, I'll rescind her expulsion.

56
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,900
But if you lose, you'll be expelled 
right along with her.

57
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,150
So there you have it.

58
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,660
Come to the annex's basement
 when you're done.

59
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,450
Let's see your mettle.

60
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:36,000
Well, looks like we're still here
 by the skin of our teeth.

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,750
For now, let's do our best and get through the afternoon session, Tadokoro.

62
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,840
Souma-kun, how could you be so stupid?!

63
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,220
How could you make an insane challenge like that?!

64
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,010
You passed!

65
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,270
So you...

66
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,890
You shoulda just lemme be!

67
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,130
Tadokoro.

68
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,680
So your dialect slips out sometimes, huh?

69
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,580
Why are you bringing that up now?!

70
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,410
Come on, on your feet.

71
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,960
We'd better not be late to the afternoon session.

72
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,880
You're always helping me out,

73
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,380
and now I've dragged you into this mess.

74
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,630
I don't know how I'll ever make it up to you.

75
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,090
You don't need to.

76
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,600
It was my own decision, 
so you don't need to apologize.

77
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,520
Besides, the reason 
I challenged him should be obvious.

78
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,610
It's because you're not meant to drop out here.

79
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,360
Well?

80
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,540
Nope, she wasn't in our room either.

81
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,330
I can't reach her cell.

82
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,840
That's really weird.

83
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,000
I wonder if something happened to Megumi.

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,750
Everyone should be done 
with the afternoon session.

85
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,460
Maybe she...

86
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,670
I didn't see her name 
on the list of people who failed.

87
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,300
Why don't we ask people who were in the same sessions as her?

88
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,050
Oh, right!

89
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,390
Wasn't Yukihira with her?

90
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,100
So where's Yukihira?

91
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,590
Come to think of it, I haven't seen him.

92
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,510
Hm....

93
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:20,440
Those two managed to get themselves
 into a Cooking Battle over Don RS.

94
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,900
Well, that was mostly Yukihira-kun's fault.

95
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,980
<i>I have a really bad feeling about this!</i>

96
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,750
There are no plans to use this hotel's annex for the training camp.

97
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,370
You're in the basement kitchen.

98
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,840
No one will interfere.

99
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,060
Wh-Why are all the alumni here?

100
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,970
I asked them to serve as judges.

101
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,980
I suspect Inui might be biased.

102
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,730
An unofficial Cooking Battle
 in the middle of a training camp?

103
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,030
Not to mention, one between
 an alumnus and a current student.

104
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,570
What would Chappelle-sensei do if he found out?

105
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,280
I bet he'd bite our heads off.

106
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,660
If he finds out about this, I'm going to run.

107
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,830
I'll say it's all Shinomiya's fault.

108
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,460
I heard that, Mizuhara!

109
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,500
We will now have an unofficial 
match, two against one.

110
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,170
Use the vegetables and other ingredients
 left over from today's sessions to make the dish.

111
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,680
You may make anything you like,

112
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,510
but try to use vegetables as the main ingredient.

113
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,560
The time limit is two hours.

114
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,100
<i>I am the reason for this Cooking Battle.</i>

115
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,730
<i>I can't let Souma-kun get expelled over this.</i>

116
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,400
<i>I'll do my best not to drag him down—</i>

117
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,860
There's one more condition.

118
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,740
Tadokoro Megumi.

119
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,200
You will be the master chef.

120
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,580
What?

121
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,830
You will decide the recipe on your own.

122
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,500
Yukihira, you'll be the sous-chef supporting her.

123
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:02,920
What?!

124
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,790
Very well!

125
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,750
Let the Cooking Battle...

126
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,460
begin!

127
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,170
Doujima-senpai!

128
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,420
<i>I'm</i> the one who issued the challenge!

129
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,420
So why that condition?

130
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,010
You had no basis for issuing your challenge, yet I made it happen anyway.

131
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,180
There's no room to negotiate.

132
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:17,760
But—

133
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,310
Yukihira! Suppose you win 
this match with your cooking,

134
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,770
and Tadokoro's expulsion is rescinded.

135
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,730
But then what?

136
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,150
She'll still be your sidekick.

137
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,150
Soon enough she'll find herself
 kicked out of another session.

138
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,150
Will you save her next time, Yukihira? And the time after that?

139
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,180
At Tohtsuki, everyone must demonstrate their worth through their own skills.

140
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,040
Whether you deserve to stay is up to you to prove.

141
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,410
So tonight,

142
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,710
at this time,

143
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,790
and at this workstation,

144
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,880
Tadokoro-kun,

145
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
<i>you're</i> the chef.

146
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,760
Doujima-san.

147
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,850
I already know what I'm going to make.

148
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,230
May I begin?

149
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,400
Go ahead.

150
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,450
Heh! I feel for you, Yukihira.

151
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,830
What do you mean?

152
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,040
It's only natural to be in despair.

153
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,830
Your fate is riding on that half-wit's skills.

154
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,690
Did you hear that?!

155
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,420
He is <i>so</i> rude!

156
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,600
Shinomiya has a really nasty personality.

157
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,100
That's why your relationships 
never last, Shinomiya-san.

158
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,300
Quiet in the peanut gallery!

159
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,100
Wait, when did you slip out of those ropes?!

160
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,850
Good luck, my Megumi-chan!

161
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,130
Don't lose to that spiteful man!

162
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,020
Shut up!

163
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,480
<i>Chef Shinomiya Kojirou.</i>

164
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,980
<i>After graduating from Tohtsuki,</i>

165
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:01,330
<i>he went to France and opened a restaurant in Paris, 
the crucible for gourmet restaurants.</i>

166
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,250
<i>I'm facing someone like </i>that<i> with my recipe?!</i>

167
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,370
<i>I... I have to calm down.</i>

168
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,580
<i>I need to calm down!</i>

169
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,460
<i>I'm blanking out.</i>

170
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,070
<i>I can't stop shaking.</i>

171
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,050
Tadokoro!

172
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,970
I doubt that you need the reminder,

173
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,090
but you're not allowed to alter her recipe.

174
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,930
You are a sous-chef, nothing more.

175
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,640
The assistant, understand?

176
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,400
You felt Tadokoro was good enough
 to merit survival, didn't you?

177
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,940
If you can't trust her cooking,

178
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,820
remove yourself from this match now.

179
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,570
No way.

180
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,740
I'm a chef.

181
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,870
No chef would ever run away from a kitchen!

182
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,250
<i>A failure.</i>

183
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,920
<i>I'm a failure, after all.</i>

184
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,260
<i>I only made it this far because of Souma-kun.</i>

185
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,010
Hey, Tadokoro.

186
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,010
<i>I'm just...</i>

187
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,140
Put your hands together.

188
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,140
<i>I'm just a...</i>

189
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,260
Do it.

190
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:16,900
Ow...

191
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,150
It's a trick I learned long ago.

192
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,740
When you're nervous, 
doing that can help you relax.

193
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,990
The only problem is that
 you can't do it by yourself.

194
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,910
<i>That hurt, but...</i>

195
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,870
<i>I've stopped shaking.</i>

196
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,670
The first thing you need to do is calm down.

197
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,130
Then, take as much time as you need
 to figure out what to cook.

198
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,340
B-But...

199
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,800
Chef Shinomiya's dish will be French cuisine that was tempered in France.

200
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,430
If I can't make a dish that can surpass his,

201
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,970
you'll be expelled.

202
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,140
My dad used to say,

203
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,890
"Cooking is about putting all you've got out there on one plate."

204
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:59,150
Forget about what the other
 guy'll be making for now.

205
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,030
But my cooking isn't...

206
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:06,160
The rice balls you made for us back at
 the dorm's garden were really great.

207
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,330
Don't think about stuff that doesn't matter.

208
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,130
Just make your own food, Tadokoro.

209
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,250
That's enough.

210
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,260
My own food...

211
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,620
Well, this is a surprise.

212
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,590
You two still haven't started cooking?

213
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,170
Your chef seems to be a real half-wit.

214
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:08,140
Why don't you wait till after you taste
 her cooking before you bitch at her?

215
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,010
Souma-kun.

216
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,280
Um, I think I...

217
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,020
may have decided on a dish.

218
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,770
What're you doing, Shinomiya-senpai?!

219
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,730
How violent!

220
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,280
Untie me—

221
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,400
If you don't shut up right
this second, I'll put a gag on you.

222
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,450
Guess that got your attention.

223
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,460
A Cooking Battle with an alumnus?!

224
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,670
Yeah, a guy who was in the same session as Tadokoro told me.

225
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,540
But why?

226
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,130
How'd that even happen?

227
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,420
Sounds like Tadokoro was about to get expelled.

228
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,800
So then Yukihira—

229
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,010
Megumi's expelled?!

230
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,880
Ugh, no!

231
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,840
This can't be!

232
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,800
Yuuki, calm down!

233
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,650
That's what I'm thinking of making.

234
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,700
How interesting!

235
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,860
Really?

236
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,950
Seriously?

237
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,700
Yay!

238
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,700
Oh, b-but this recipe would require a lot
 of prep work with different ingredients,

239
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,540
so I'm not sure we can manage.

240
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,330
Who do you think I am?

241
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,550
I was holding the fort as the number two chef at Yukihira Diner!

242
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,550
Well, it <i>was</i> only the two of us, 
just my dad and me.

243
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:36,520
I'll give you everything I've got,
experience and all, to support you.

244
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:41,270
Just for today, we'll open Tadokoro Diner!

245
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,820
O-Okay!

246
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,070
Great!

247
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,070
Let's do this,

248
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,440
Chef Tadokoro!

249
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,400
Okay!

250
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,530
I'll prep the tomatoes.

251
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,620
Souma-kun, please get the other ingredients ready.

252
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,370
Got it!

253
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,870
Shinomiya-senpai!

254
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,080
What, Hinako?

255
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:03,130
The "dokoro" in "restaurant" and
 the "dokoro" in "Tadokoro" overlap.

256
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,880
It makes the name really catchy!

257
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,170
Take her somewhere far away!

258
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,170
Seriously?!

259
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,840
Why?!

260
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,260
<i>I'll only get more nervous
 if I focus on beating Chef Shinomiya.</i>

261
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,220
<i>Just focus on my own cooking.</i>

262
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,730
<i>I'm the chef right now.</i>

263
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,060
<i>Oh, no!</i>

264
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,480
<i>I was supposed to prepare the shoulder cut first!</i>

265
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,980
<i>Now the order's all wrong—</i>

266
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,900
The shoulder's done.

267
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,640
I removed all the tendons too.

268
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,780
Which do you want me to do next,
 the chicken liver or the fatback?

269
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,660
U-Um, the liver, please!

270
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,540
Got it!

271
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,290
Souma-kun!

272
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,250
Is the mold ready?

273
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:41,960
Yup!

274
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,500
Just gotta get the pâté ready.

275
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,500
By the way, I'll be done sauteeing
 the vegetables in twelve seconds.

276
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,380
Th-Thanks.

277
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,720
<i>He's amazing!</i>

278
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,390
<i>He's delivering all the prepped ingredients to me right when I need them!</i>

279
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,970
Is this how finely you wanted it chopped?

280
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:57,720
Yeah!

281
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,060
<i>He's the only one helping me,</i>

282
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,650
<i>but I feel like I'm able to cook several times
 faster than I'd be able to by myself.</i>

283
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,860
What's going on?

284
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:12,610
He's staying several steps ahead of her and
providing support without neglecting his own tasks.

285
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,660
Yet he doesn't rush ahead and
 go beyond what's necessary.

286
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,580
He's monitoring her very carefully
 to avoid getting in her way.

287
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,170
Hm, Yukihira Souma.

288
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,960
He's the sole transfer student this year.

289
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,750
His family runs a diner.

290
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,510
It seems he was trained there.

291
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,760
I find it hard to believe he gained
 that much skill from helping out at home.

292
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,060
His skill clearly surpasses that of any student.

293
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,310
Both contestants should begin finishing up!

294
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,230
We'll start plating the dish!

295
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:49,980
Got it!

296
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,610
We will now begin the judging.

297
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,530
Shinomiya's dish will be presented first.

298
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,200
Serve your dish.

299
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,200
<i>A dish made by a Tohtsuki alumnus...</i>

300
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,330
<i>I wonder how amazing it'll be.</i>

301
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,830
Well, I can't help but feel anticipation!

302
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,590
Indeed.

303
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,170
Hm?

304
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,500
Chou farci!

305
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,720
This is rather unexpected.

306
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,430
It's from the regional cuisine of Auvergne.

307
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:24,890
A filling of finely chopped meat and vegetables
 is wrapped in cabbage leaves, then steamed.

308
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,940
It resembles the more familiar
 cabbage roll found in Western cuisine.

309
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:32,040
It's a dish often made in French homes.

310
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,860
I'm taken aback.

311
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,700
I thought Shinomiya-senpai only
 knew how to make fancy dishes—

312
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,040
Wait, where's my share?

313
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,040
I didn't make any for you.

314
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,370
Ask Mizuhara to share.

315
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,620
Well, then.

316
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,710
Ah!

317
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,460
The aroma of herbs whets the appetite.

318
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,020
M... Me...

319
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,020
Meraviglioso!

320
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:12,820
Th-This stuffing is different from the typical
 pork and onion stuffing used in chou farci!

321
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,320
It's a farce of Jidori chicken breast meat!

322
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,700
First, he butterflied the chicken breasts.

323
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:30,290
Farce

324
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:30,290
m 1632 135 l 1792.5 135 1792.5 670.5 1632 670.5

325
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:23,040
Then he prepared a stuffing of morels, asparagus,
 and fois gras sauteed in beef fat,

326
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:28,620
along with a smooth mousse-like paste made from
the chicken breast, butter, eggs, and heavy cream.

327
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,420
The chou farci was then steamed.

328
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,420
<i>This mousse coats the tongue,</i>

329
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:38,430
<i>then dissolves instantly into a rich burst of flavor in your mouth.</i>

330
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:42,550
And the most fearsome ingredient of all
 is the cabbage that envelops the filling.

331
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,680
<i>The Savoy cabbage.</i>

332
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,560
<i>In Japan, it's called the crepe cabbage.</i>

333
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,850
<i>It has a strong grassy smell when raw,</i>

334
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,070
<i>but it develops a delicate,
 sweet flavor once cooked.</i>

335
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,900
<i>Blanchir... blanching.</i>

336
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,530
<i>Vapeur... steaming.</i>

337
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,070
<i>At each step,</i>

338
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:03,980
<i>he cooked the dish at its optimal temperature.</i>

339
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,960
<i>That resulted in a delicate sweetness
 that elevates the flavor of the entire dish.</i>

340
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,250
<i>It's as if he cast a spell over the whole dish.</i>

341
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:24,470
<i>Immediately following graduation,
 he went to France by himself.</i>

342
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,810
<i>He opened a restaurant in Paris
after several years of training</i>

343
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,140
<i>and became an owner-chef.</i>

344
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,980
<i>While most dishes in French cuisine use meat,</i>

345
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,730
<i>Shinomiya shone a fresh spotlight
 on légumes, or vegetables,</i>

346
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,200
<i>shocking gourmands throughout the nation.</i>

347
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:46,910
<i>Eventually, the chef from Japan gained the respect of the residents of the capital of gourmet cooking.</i>

348
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,870
<i>He was honored with the name,</i>

349
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,300
<i>"The Magician of Légumes."</i>

350
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,790
<i>I hate to admit it...</i>

351
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,550
<i>I hate to admit it, but it's delicious!</i>

352
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,550
<i>He took a common regional dish and 
reinterpreted it with his sharpened senses...</i>

353
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,140
<i>...and elevated it to something that could be served at a high-end restaurant.</i>

354
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:09,220
<i>The light chicken mousse that melts in your mouth,</i>

355
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:15,690
<i>and the fresh sweetness of the cabbage
envelops your mouth and beyond!</i>

356
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,820
<i>It's as if the power of this dish's flavor is coursing through your body!</i>

357
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,820
<i>This...</i>

358
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,820
<i>...is magic!</i>

359
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,820
<i>Indeed.</i>

360
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,160
<i>Yes!</i>

361
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,620
<i>It is a spell cast by a magician from the East!</i>

362
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,250
<i>Légume Magic!</i>

363
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,220
Cabbage Red.

364
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,390
Ca...

365
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,640
Cabbage Blue.

366
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,350
Cabbage Pink!

367
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,150
Yes!

368
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,110
Magical Cabbage!

369
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,480
Magic, magic!

370
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,660
That was fantastic.

371
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,870
Well done, Shinomiya-san.

372
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,460
It is no wonder that you are called
 the Magician of Légumes.

373
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,000
So, how did it taste, Mizuhara?

374
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:49,340
It was perfect once I wiped
 all my memories of you.

375
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,970
Well, how unfortunate for you.

376
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,560
Still, I wasn't expecting this, Shinomiya.

377
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:00,310
I thought I'd be able to try the specialty 
of your restaurant, Shino.

378
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,150
That's a joke in poor taste, Doujima-san.

379
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,110
My opponent's only a student.

380
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,610
Would I be so cruel as to serve my signature dish?

381
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,120
You would.

382
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,620
You would crush them, 
so that they'd never be able to cook again.

383
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,770
<i>An up-and-coming chef who's opened a restaurant in a prime location in Paris,</i>

384
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,500
<i>the battleground of gourmet food.</i>

385
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,550
<i>He believes he can't possibly lose to a student,</i>

386
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,470
<i>an arrogance that may well be justified.</i>

387
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,340
<i>If he has an Achilles's heel, it'd be...</i>

388
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:35,560
All right. Tadokoro, Yukihira, serve your dish.

389
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,260
'Kay.

390
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,850
O-Okay.

391
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,690
<i>Our dish will finally be judged.</i>

392
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,990
Let's go, Tadokoro!

393
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,360
Tadokoro?

394
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:51,070
<i>I poured everything I had into this dish.</i>

395
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:54,070
<i>I didn't think that having 
someone judge it would be so...</i>

396
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,280
<i>so terrifying.</i>

397
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,060
<i>I wonder what they'll say.</i>

398
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,560
<i>What if they say it's disgusting?</i>

399
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,690
<i>I even had Souma-kun's help!</i>

400
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,630
It'll be fine.

401
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:09,130
Go!

402
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,060
Hm?

403
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,020
Hm!

404
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,730
This is...

405
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,110
It's a terrine!

406
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,210
Next time on <i>Shokugeki no Souma</i>,

407
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,330
the twelfth dish.

408
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,010
You're fired.

409
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,680
Yes!

410
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,590
Magical Cabbage!

411
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,580
Yeah!
