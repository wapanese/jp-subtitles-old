1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,250
This is the last one.

2
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,620
Disgusting!

3
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,320
Ow!

4
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,480
It's incredible that you lot have managed to come up with this many train wrecks.

5
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,190
That last oyster gruel, in particular,

6
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,230
was as if... yes,

7
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,440
as if I were taking a bath with a western lowland gorilla!

8
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,860
Again, we have no idea what you mean.

9
00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:00,410
Family: Hominidae; Genus: Gorilla; 
Western Lowland Gorilla 
 The largest living primate.  
 Eats primarily fruit, grass, leaves, and vines. 
 The fur on the back of adult males turn 
greyish-white, hence the name "silverbacks."
 One male forms a harem with several females...

10
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,410
Her palate is incomparable to that of a mere mortal.

11
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,750
I can tell that you omitted one of the steps in prep work.

12
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,040
I am aware that your restaurant group is expanding,

13
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,710
and that you're trying to increase your efficiency for that reason.

14
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:17,590
But how dare you presume that gives you the right to defile my tongue with such garbage?

15
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,770
M-My apologies, Lady Erina!

16
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,410
<i>It's time for you to go, Souma.</i>

17
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,790
<i>Go figure out what you've got.</i>

18
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,930
I stick out like a sore thumb.

19
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,270
Why do all the other applicants have butlers and guards and stuff?

20
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,770
<i>Oh, I didn't tell you?</i>

21
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:38,490
<i>You're taking the transfer admission exam 
for one of the best culinary academies in the country.</i>

22
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,420
<i>The graduation rate is less than 10 percent.</i>

23
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,570
<i>It's a super-elite institution.</i>

24
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,530
<i>Best of luck with that, Souma.</i>

25
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,540
<i>At that school—</i>

26
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,700
<i>Hey, Jo!</i>

27
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,560
<i>Please wait a moment!</i>

28
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,960
Where are you right now, Dad?

29
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,920
<i>New York City.</i>

30
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,270
<i>In the Manhattan Royal Hotel's reception hall for VIPs.</i>

31
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,930
That's where I'm cooking now.

32
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,350
Hey, Jo!

33
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,810
I'm so happy you came back to New York!

34
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,680
This is the best dinner ever!

35
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,310
Simmer down, Dr. McFly!

36
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,940
Your blood pressure will go up again!

37
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,030
Delicious.

38
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,080
After taking a medical leave of absence from Congress,

39
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,160
I resigned myself to my fate and thought my life would be complete

40
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,790
if I could eat Yukihira's cooking just one last time.

41
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,250
But this only makes me greedy for more!

42
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,910
Let's come again, sir!

43
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,260
Yes, as many times as possible!

44
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,090
Is Yukihira here?!

45
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,180
Please come back, Master!

46
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,120
We're in the middle of a fast!

47
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,370
What example are you setting—

48
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,810
Bah, silence, silence, silence!

49
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,270
You're telling me to spurn Yukihira's cooking
 when it's right in front of me?!

50
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,980
In that case...

51
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,940
I reject my calling!

52
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,330
Master!

53
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,200
Yukihira!

54
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,720
First I went to India, then Italy and Spain.

55
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,950
I just arrived in America yesterday.

56
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,910
The plan is for me to be cooking up and down the East Coast for a while.

57
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,910
<i>Huh?</i>

58
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,920
<i>I don't understand.</i>

59
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,420
Well, let's just say someone called in a favor.

60
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,800
Hey, Souma.

61
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,760
If you can't survive that academy,

62
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,260
<i>you can kiss your pipe dream
 of surpassing me goodbye.</i>

63
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,810
<i>Just watch me!</i>

64
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,680
Good.

65
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,520
Then let me tell you the secret to improving your—

66
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,610
He hung up on me.

67
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,400
Where did you go, Yukihira?!

68
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,440
Coming!

69
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,030
<i>Listen up, Souma.</i>

70
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,030
<i>The trick to becoming a good chef is...</i>

71
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:58,210
<i>finding a woman you want to cook for
for the rest of your life.</i>

72
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,010
So what's next on my plate?

73
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,340
This, Milady.

74
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,930
Judging transfer exams?

75
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,600
So this is the kind of boring work I get for joining the council.

76
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,180
I'll head over after I change.

77
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,320
<i>Damn it...</i>

78
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,320
<i>A pipe dream? Yeah, right.</i>

79
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,570
<i>I'll definitely make it to graduation, damn it!</i>

80
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,700
S-Sorry!

81
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,160
I didn't notice you sitting there.

82
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,080
No need to apologize.

83
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,660
You also wish to transfer in, right?

84
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,660
Take a seat, won't you?

85
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,330
High school qualifying exam results are being announced for Tohtsuki's junior high school,

86
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,090
and exams are being held for people like us hoping to transfer in,

87
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,300
so it's pretty lively today.

88
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,920
I'm Nikaido Yoshiaki.

89
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,390
My family runs a French restaurant.

90
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,350
Oh, what a coincidence.

91
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,060
Mine runs a restaurant too.

92
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,180
That may not be such a coincidence.

93
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,980
The man over there is the heir
 to a national restaurant chain,

94
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,030
and that one's family runs a wholesale seafood business that supplies the entire Kanto region.

95
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,730
Almost everyone here has
some sort of tie to the culinary world.

96
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,160
Oh?

97
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,910
What's the name of your place?

98
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,350
It's called Yukihira.

99
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,580
Yukihira...

100
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,870
You serve traditional fare, perhaps?

101
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,880
No way, it's nothing that fancy.

102
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,210
We're a diner downtown.

103
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,430
How dare you sit next to <i>me</i>,

104
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,640
you low-class commoner!

105
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,100
Listen up!

106
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,140
This academy isn't for the likes of you!

107
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:47,400
It is a sacred grove, an institution of learning for
denizens of the upper echelons of the food industry!

108
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,820
<i>That's</i> the kind of place Tohtsuki Teahouse Culinary Academy is!

109
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,620
A low-born like you won't even make it 
past the screening of applications.

110
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,240
Huh?

111
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,920
You haven't even tried Yukihara's food!

112
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,620
You don't get to pass judgment!

113
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,330
Young Master!

114
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,330
Young Master!

115
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,260
Look, someone from a <i>diner</i> thinks he can attend this academy.

116
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,050
You've got to be kidding me.

117
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,720
He should know his place.

118
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,720
<i>This isn't giving me high hopes for this place.</i>

119
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,680
<i>If this is how things are right off the bat,</i>

120
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,730
<i>who knows what sort of pompous ass
 I'll get as the examiner.</i>

121
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,310
Hey, is that...

122
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,610
Y-Yeah.

123
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,360
Greetings, transfer applicants.

124
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,070
I am Nakiri Erina, and I have been 
assigned to judge today's transfer exam.

125
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,780
<i>A girl?</i>

126
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,950
<i>And she's wearing the school's uniform.</i>

127
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,170
<i>She's the examiner?</i>

128
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,210
What do the instructions from the exam department say?

129
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,170
I'll read it now.

130
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:51,630
Examinees will first undergo interviews in groups of ten based on their applications.

131
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,470
They will then complete a practical,
 in which they will cook up to three dishes.

132
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,260
Those who pass will—

133
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,970
Hmph.

134
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,260
What a waste of time.

135
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:00,640
I have an idea.

136
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,810
Bring a kitchen work table here.

137
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,100
Y-Yes, Milady!

138
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,770
Cooking ingredients?

139
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,150
What's she up to?

140
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,040
The main ingredient will be eggs.

141
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,410
Make one dish.

142
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:28,960
Only those whose creations impress my palate will be allowed to transfer into this academy.

143
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,590
C'mon.

144
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,420
Furthermore,

145
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:38,590
anyone who wishes to withdraw
his application has one minute to do so.

146
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,390
What? One minute?

147
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,390
I'm withdrawing!

148
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,560
What?!

149
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,910
Hey, wait!

150
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,150
Why are you all running?!

151
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,570
You don't know who <i>she</i> is?!

152
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,440
Huh? Nope.

153
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,070
Who is she?

154
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,780
Nakiri Erina has the finest palate known to mankind! A divine tongue!

155
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,360
The God Tongue!

156
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,240
Huh?

157
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,750
Humans typically begin talking
between the ages of one and two.

158
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,880
But her first spoken words, at three months old, were...

159
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,920
<i>Not enough depth of flavor.</i>

160
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,430
Given the small glimpse of her genius already present at birth,

161
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:25,980
she has been asked to be the taste tester at famous restaurants across the nation since she was young.

162
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,650
All the heavyweights in the food world are her clients!

163
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,690
Any evaluation she makes will spread far and wide in the industry!

164
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,400
If she...

165
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,840
If she were to brand you as an talentless imbecile,

166
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,040
your career in the food world would be over!

167
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,000
I figured most of them were hopeless incompetents.

168
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,500
I can't be bothered to waste my time on such fools.

169
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,720
I believe that clears my schedule for the day?

170
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,130
Uh, yes.

171
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,090
I will be testing new dishes in my private quarters.

172
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,380
<i>Erina-sama's new dishes...</i>

173
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,690
What's the matter, Hisako?

174
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,730
It looks like you wish to ask me something.

175
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,900
Oh, no, well...

176
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,840
Would you like the privilege of trying my cooking?

177
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,410
I... I would!

178
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,870
What a shameless hussy you are.

179
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,170
Oh, please forgive me!

180
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:38,790
First we'll have to report that no one passed.

181
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,420
Yes.

182
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:46,560
Hey, so are there no other restrictions on the dish?

183
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,180
<i>What?</i>

184
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:51,850
<i>I...</i>

185
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,560
<i>have a challenger?</i>

186
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,620
As long as you use eggs,

187
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,820
you can make anything you want.

188
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,200
But are you sure about this?

189
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,870
This is your last chance to—

190
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,330
Man, I was so worried!

191
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,500
I thought you might fail me
 before I even got to cook!

192
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,500
How dare you!

193
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,210
Do you know who she is?!

194
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,210
Who is she?

195
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,410
She's the top of her junior high class

196
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,430
and the youngest member
 <i>ever</i> of the Elite Ten Council,

197
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,960
the highest decision-making body in the academy:

198
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,390
Nakiri Erina-sama!

199
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,640
Whoa.

200
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,310
What a magnificent knife.

201
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,520
Don't wander off!

202
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:35,610
Huh?

203
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,980
Let me ask you one last time.

204
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,610
Are you really going to take <i>my</i> exam?

205
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,940
Huh?

206
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,610
But...

207
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,490
I just have to get you to say it tastes good, right?

208
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,200
Of course I'll take the test.

209
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,870
<i>This boy...</i>

210
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,250
Erina-sama.

211
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,130
Yukihira Souma.

212
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,630
His family runs a diner.

213
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,970
It's clear that he's a second-rate cook.

214
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,220
He has no conception of my noble pedigree,

215
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,430
just like a stray dog would have no idea of a gemstone's value.

216
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,480
If that's your attitude,

217
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,810
I'll taste your food.

218
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,560
The food of the bottom feeders of the culinary world.

219
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,280
Then I'll be happy to...

220
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,990
serve you...

221
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,610
our specialty!

222
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,410
Hang onto your seat,

223
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,460
Examiner Nakiri!

224
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,080
Eggs are a fundamental ingredient

225
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,630
in Japanese, Western, and Chinese cuisine across all culinary genres.

226
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:46,630
Erina-sama tastes egg-based <i>haute cuisine</i> every day.

227
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,820
What will he serve her?

228
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,400
<i>I see that he's using beaten eggs,</i>

229
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,020
<i>but I have no idea what dish he's working towards.</i>

230
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,160
Yukihira Souma-kun, what are you making?

231
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,830
Huh?

232
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,880
You still can't tell at this stage?

233
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,630
Do you want me to fail you right now?!

234
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,960
Listen!

235
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,590
I don't have time to waste on ill-conceived food.

236
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:31,120
I'm asking you if you have any intention of 
making a dish that is suitable for my palate!

237
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,430
Fine, I'll tell you.

238
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:39,390
What I'm making is the eighth item on Yukihira Diner's secret menu!

239
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,270
Secret menu?

240
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,480
And what manner of elaborate dish would this be?

241
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,110
Rice with seasoning!

242
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,950
Huh?

243
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,450
Cut the crap!

244
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,410
I knew you were a good-for-nothing cook.

245
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,370
What a waste of time.

246
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,650
Erina-sama...

247
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:05,250
It goes without saying that
 it's no ordinary seasoning.

248
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,880
What I'm making...

249
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,680
is rice with transforming seasoning!

250
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,540
Transforming seasoning?

251
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,350
All right!

252
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,570
Almost done!

253
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,940
<i>Yukihira Souma...</i>

254
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,860
<i>What dish is he about to serve?</i>

255
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,410
Thank you for waiting!

256
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,710
<i>No.</i>

257
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,380
<i>Like I initially thought, he's just messing with me!</i>

258
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,010
<i>It really is ordinary.</i>

259
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,660
In the end, it's still the work of a second-rate cook.

260
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,680
It fails to arouse my appetite.

261
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,730
<i>My palate has been called the God Tongue.</i>

262
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,010
<i>Only the most elaborate and refined
</i>haute cuisine<i> graces </i>my<i> dining table.</i>

263
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,640
<i>Indeed, I reside in a gourmet paradise!</i>

264
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,280
<i>How dare he serve something like this to me?</i>

265
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,680
This examination is over.

266
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,950
Erina-sama!

267
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,750
But you haven't seen its true form yet.

268
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,380
What do you mean?

269
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,610
<i>There's something hidden beneath the egg.</i>

270
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,850
Well, keep your eyes peeled.

271
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,390
The true value of a rice seasoning

272
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,150
is only revealed when it's served on rice.

273
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,610
Well, then...

274
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,650
Here we go!

275
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,660
<i>It's melting... from the rice's heat?</i>

276
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:18,220
<i>And as it melts, it coats the egg.</i>

277
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,310
<i>What is this aroma?</i>

278
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,350
<i>Chicken?</i>

279
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,940
<i>The fragrant, mellow aroma of gently simmered chicken is wafting through the air.</i>

280
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,320
<i>So this is rice with transforming seasoning?</i>

281
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:38,120
<i>It looks completely different from before.</i>

282
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,080
<i>I wonder what it tastes like.</i>

283
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,540
I suppose I can deign to take one bite.

284
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,460
Hand it over!

285
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,380
Here you go!

286
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,950
<i>I can't believe this!</i>

287
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,280
<i>I forgot to judge it and just savored the taste?!</i>

288
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,790
<i>What was that texture?!</i>

289
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,790
Oh?

290
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,250
You're going for a second bite?

291
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,670
I thought I heard you say one bite only.

292
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,370
Do you have any complaints about that?!

293
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,890
I'm just kidding.

294
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,090
Take your time and eat up.

295
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,600
It's aspic, isn't it?

296
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,200
Bingo!

297
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,570
The cubes are aspic made from chicken wingtips.

298
00:18:54,030 --> 00:19:01,070
Aspic is formed when meat or fish broth 
with high gelatin content congeals into jelly.

299
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:05,330
I simmered chicken wingtips with bonito stock, sake, and light soy sauce,

300
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:09,460
then finely chopped the aspic
 once it cooled and solidified.

301
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,130
When that's sprinkled over hot rice,

302
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:16,760
the aspic melts and the gelatinous broth coats the egg soboro.

303
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:22,470
<i>In effect, this aspic is a rich soup infused with the umami of chicken.</i>

304
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,640
<i>The rich flavor and saltiness of this broth...</i>

305
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,940
<i>are enhancing the fluffy egg
 soboro's subtle sweetness.</i>

306
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:36,440
<i>With every bite, the fluffy and gelatinous textures caress the insides of your mouth.</i>

307
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,960
<i>The melted aspic elevates the egg
 to entirely new heights.</i>

308
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,900
<i>This is unlike any dish I've ever eaten.</i>

309
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,870
<i>It's an entirely new world of flavor.</i>

310
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,820
So how is it?

311
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,500
Good thing you didn't storm off earlier, right?

312
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,330
S...

313
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,680
Silence!

314
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,260
The evaluation has yet to be concluded!

315
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,920
Even if the menu item is humble in the extreme,

316
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,880
we use our creativity to transform it into a masterpiece!

317
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,590
<i>That</i> is Yukihira cooking.

318
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,260
<i>Even so...</i>

319
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,970
<i>how can I, a denizen of gourmet paradise, accept this?</i>

320
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:14,860
<i>This, a dish by the personification of all things déclassé!</i>

321
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,910
<i>I can't... accept this.</i>

322
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:22,280
<i>I just... can't.</i>

323
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,800
<i>This flavor...</i>

324
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,830
<i>It's as if...</i>

325
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,370
<i>I'm being caressed by angel feathers!</i>

326
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,650
<i>Go away!</i>

327
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,360
<i>Stay away!</i>

328
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,320
<i>Stay away, I say!</i>

329
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,700
<i>No!</i>

330
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,400
<i>I don't want to accept it.</i>

331
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,960
<i>but my palate... my body can't help but react.</i>

332
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,470
Sure, we may be a small diner,

333
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:28,040
and I'm sure you're one of the elites of the culinary world.

334
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,430
But, you know,

335
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,100
I bet there are some things you can't make

336
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,980
if you get too comfortable sneering down at people from your throne.

337
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,480
Erina-sama.

338
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,190
Well? What is it?

339
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,150
Yukihira-style rice with seasoning.

340
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,610
Is it delicious or disgusting?

341
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,070
Tell me!

342
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:56,370
It's...

343
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,000
disgusting!

344
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,540
<i>What?!</i>

345
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,470
How dare he, how <i>dare</i> he, how dare <i>he</i>?!

346
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,430
Talking down to me like that!

347
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,890
To <i>me</i>, Nakiri Erina!

348
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,350
Unforgivable!

349
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,770
<i>Yukihira Souma...</i>

350
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:25,650
<i>Tohtsuki Academy has no need for people like you!</i>

351
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,780
Hello? It's Erina.

352
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,410
Please tell Grandfather,

353
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,490
the director of the academy,

354
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,750
that no one passed the exam today.

355
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,330
Next time on <i>Shokugeki no Souma</i>,

356
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,580
