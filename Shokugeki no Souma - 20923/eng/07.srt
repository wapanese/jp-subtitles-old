1
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,860
Too boring.

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,490
This one's no good.

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,570
Not this either.

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,290
I have to put my game face on today.

5
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,120
Let's go with this one!

6
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,010
Did you all hear about the Cooking Battle today?

7
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,140
Yeah, it's between Nikumi and the Don RS, right?

8
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,150
I feel bad for the Don RS, getting into Nakiri Erina's crosshairs like that.

9
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,610
Hey, did you read today's <i>Tohtsuki Sports News</i>?

10
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,030
They've changed the matchup.

11
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,150
See, Nikumi's facing off against
that cocky transfer student,

12
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,740
Yukihira Souma!

13
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,700
Here are the ingredients and tools for the match.

14
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,210
I got everything you asked for.

15
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,790
Yup. Thanks, Konishi-san!

16
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,750
Did you get any sleep at all, Yukihira?

17
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,960
I spent some more time tweaking the sauce.

18
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,670
I think I maybe got about two hours.

19
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,020
<i>So many people!</i>

20
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,900
S-Souma-kun, d-don't get too nervous!

21
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,690
D-Don't get nervous, okay?!

22
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,640
A-At times like this,

23
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,190
you write the character for "person" like so.

24
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,110
Okay, sure.

25
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,150
On your palm, okay?

26
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,910
Why don't you take care of that for me, Tadokoro?

27
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,990
On your palm, got it?!

28
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,910
On your palm-

29
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,490
Huh?

30
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,320
Aren't you nervous at all?

31
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,910
You're going to be cooking
 in front of that huge crowd.

32
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,870
Nope.

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,080
This isn't scary in the least.

34
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,950
It's nothing like cooking in front of customers,
placing our restaurant's reputation on the line.

35
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,930
<i>If I beat you,</i>

36
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,720
<i>will that make me the seventh best at Tohtsuki?</i>

37
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,730
Ladies and gentlemen!

38
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:37,530
The Council has certified this match as an official Cooking Battle!

39
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,350
I am Kawashima Urara,

40
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,570
a first-year in the high school division.

41
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,950
I'll be your host for this event!

42
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,330
Super cute!

43
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,330
Urara-chan!

44
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,040
Hi!

45
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,710
Cute!

46
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,470
Cute!

47
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,860
The contestants will now be making their entrances from those corners!

48
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,520
The first one to enter is...

49
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:23,650
the Meat Master, Mito Ikumi!

50
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,200
<i>Hmph! Quit flaunting your giant melons,</i>

51
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,540
<i>you Holstein cow!</i>

52
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,500
I'm <i>the only one here who should have fanboys!</i>

53
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,080
All right!

54
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,630
Here comes the other contestant!

55
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,800
Die, dipshit!

56
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Eat it!

57
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,840
Die, transfer student!

58
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,800
I still remember the shit you pulled at the opening ceremony!

59
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,190
The transfer student who's already gained widespread notoriety,

60
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,940
Yukihira Souma-kun!

61
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,360
Between him and Mito,

62
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,230
it's obvious who'll win.

63
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,070
Yeah, I can't wait to see him get expelled!

64
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,570
Hey, what's with this massive crowd?

65
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,490
I'll never forget it.

66
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,710
When I had a Cooking Battle with the 
Stand-up Dining Soba Research Society,

67
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,250
there wasn't a host, much less an audience.

68
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,590
The only witnesses were stray dogs attracted by the smell of food.

69
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,170
And what's with this hostility?

70
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,640
Didn't you just transfer in this spring?

71
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,850
Why do you already have so many haters?

72
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,810
Dunno. I haven't done anything weird.

73
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,310
And now, here are the terms of this match!

74
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,480
There will be three judges.

75
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,190
The theme is the don.

76
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,070
The main ingredient is meat!

77
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,330
If Mito-san wins,

78
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,490
the Donburi Research Society will be shut down,

79
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,540
and Yukihira-kun will be expelled.

80
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,630
If Yukihira-kun wins, 
the Don RS's budget will be increased,

81
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,670
and their cooking facilities will be renovated.

82
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,920
Finally,

83
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,420
Mito-san will join the Don RS!

84
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,930
Hey, transfer student.

85
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,220
Today'll be the last day that you can talk to me.

86
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,430
If you've got any last words, now's the time.

87
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,140
Really?

88
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,440
I don't see why we can't talk anytime we want

89
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,690
when we're in the Don RS club room.

90
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,460
Hey, look!

91
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,030
It's Nakiri Erina.

92
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,410
Erina-sama...

93
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,200
Erina-sama!

94
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,630
Wow, seriously?!

95
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,830
Why?

96
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,460
Why would one of the Elite Ten bother to attend

97
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,260
a small-time Cooking Battle
 involving the Don RS?

98
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,720
It's because Mito is part of
 Nakiri Erina's faction, isn't it?

99
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,220
Really?

100
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,220
Is that the only reason?

101
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,020
<i>All right, Yukihira-kun.</i>

102
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:03,400
<i>Show me how you lose in utter disgrace.</i>

103
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,110
<i>Erina-sama has come all this way to watch us?</i>

104
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,570
Let us proceed!

105
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,990
Contestants, to your stations!

106
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,490
Everything is at stake

107
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,990
in this battle of the palates!

108
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,450
Let the Cooking Battle...

109
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,410
begin!

110
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,920
Transfer student!

111
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,510
Let me show you something that a low-life like you could never hope to touch in his whole sorry life!

112
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,390
Behold, the ultimate meat!

113
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,270
I told you that's what she would use!

114
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,310
It's A5 beef!

115
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,830
That's a cleaver for butchering meat.

116
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,990
She's wielding that big knife with precision

117
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,120
to sever the tendons.

118
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,670
Her strength is incredible!

119
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,510
I've never seen marbling that fine!

120
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,550
The glistening of the fat and muscle is unbelievable!

121
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,400
<i>Attaboy.</i>

122
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,230
<i>There's a faint sweetness that tickles the nose.</i>

123
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,490
<i>As meat ages,</i>

124
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,240
<i>the quantity of umami factors
 like glutamic acid increases,</i>

125
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,490
<i>which results in a sweet smell.</i>

126
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,450
<i>I'm going to prepare the finest meat</i>

127
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,710
<i>with the finest skills!</i>

128
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,200
First, I'll sear the meat...

129
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,470
while basting it with butter!

130
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,310
The rich scent of butter is permeating the arena!

131
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,350
Just a whiff of it is enough
 to whet your appetite!

132
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:16,200
<i>I've now built a wall around 
the meat to trap the juices inside.</i>

133
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,030
<i>Next...</i>

134
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,280
Put the meat in the oven,

135
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,870
and cook it all the way through.

136
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,160
Well, then.

137
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,540
<i>How's the transfer student doing?</i>

138
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,170
As for Yukihira-kun,

139
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,880
it seems he has just finished mincing a large number of onions.

140
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,510
Just what could he be planning to do with them?

141
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,050
Oh!

142
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,050
Looks like he's finally taking out his meat!

143
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,060
Let's see how his meat measures up to Mito-san's A5-grade wagyu beef!

144
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:45,730
What?

145
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,480
"Cheap."

146
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,320
"Half off"?

147
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,830
I lucked out! It happened to be on sale!

148
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,870
This is bullshit!

149
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,000
Oh, please stop!

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,710
Please stop throwing things!

151
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,920
Yukihira, are you sure you know what you're doing?

152
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,880
I've seen enough.

153
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,590
You can just use the rest of your time to pack up.

154
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,940
Can you tell what the foundation of her cooking is?

155
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:38,450
Could it be her sheer strength, 
which allows her to carve up a carcass with ease?

156
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,280
That's certainly one of her talents.

157
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,120
But her true strength lies in the opposite direction.

158
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,580
It's her delicate sensibility.

159
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,330
64—

160
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,830
No, 65 degrees Celsius.

161
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,040
Okay.

162
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,720
The lips are among the most
temperature-sensitive body parts we have.

163
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,840
Even so,

164
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,140
her ability to precisely determine
the temperature of meat is unique.

165
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:09,600
Mito Ikumi's sensibility shines brightest when she handles meat.

166
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,270
You're right.

167
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,440
Look at her fingertips,

168
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,740
the depth of her affection toward the meat.

169
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:23,030
It's like watching a piano soloist 
in a flowing performance.

170
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,700
Can't you hear the heavenly melody?

171
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,040
The sonata of meat?

172
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,170
<i>I will present this victory to Erina-sama!</i>

173
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,130
What, you're still here?

174
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:46,140
Why have you grown quiet all 
of a sudden, transfer student?

175
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,600
What happened to that bravado
 from three days ago?

176
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,020
Say something, you pathetic wretch.

177
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,110
I don't need to say a word.

178
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,160
Soon my don will be telling an eloquent tale.

179
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,070
Huh?

180
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,340
Besides...

181
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,810
it's common knowledge that any chef who talks too much in the kitchen

182
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,210
can't be trusted to have any actual talent.

183
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,330
Are you mocking me?!

184
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:22,880
<i>What?</i>

185
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,220
<i>What's he trying to pull?</i>

186
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,390
Time's running out!

187
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,280
Time's up!

188
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,990
I love reading fairy tales!

189
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,620
I love romance movies too!

190
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,080
My dream is to become a bride!

191
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,710
The judging will now commence.

192
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,210
Mito-san's dish will go first.

193
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,140
Mine's a "Rôti" Don made with A5 wagyu beef!

194
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,600
Rôti is French for "roast."

195
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,080
It's often used to denote
 dishes cooked in the oven!

196
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,020
The sliced meat is like a flower.

197
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,490
I'm honored to be presented with such a beautiful don.

198
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,950
Thank you for the food!

199
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,750
It's so delicious that it's paralyzing!

200
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,960
This is it!

201
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:38,670
This profound umami is the A5's true strength!

202
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,750
And this meat...

203
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,130
She even accounted for the angle at which the heat was applied.

204
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,840
When heat is applied perpendicular to the grain of the meat,

205
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,760
that energy is spread evenly,

206
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,560
and more juices are released.

207
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,100
The best chefs take even the grain
 of the meat into account!

208
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,310
And note what's beneath the "petals"!

209
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,860
The garlic rice sautéed in beef fat and butter is exquisite!

210
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,280
I could eat three bowls of this rice alone!

211
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,600
This dish is fantastic, even seductive!

212
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,910
It's superb!

213
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,950
<i>Do you get it now, transfer student?</i>

214
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,460
This<i> is the pleasure of meat!</i>

215
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,460
It's a blowout.

216
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,930
Just let us see the transfer student's face when he loses already.

217
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,950
We're in trouble.

218
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,760
The crowd seems to think Mito-san's won.

219
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,730
Let's have the judges evaluate Yukihira-kun's dish now!

220
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,440
What would you call your don?

221
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:46,070
Well, how about the Yukihira-style
 Chaliapin Steak Don?

222
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,660
Chaliapin steak, huh?

223
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,450
So you used onions to tenderize cheap meat.

224
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:57,080
But how could it measure up
 to what we've just tasted?

225
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,240
Indeed, I'd just rather go home while 
savoring the lingering flavor of A5 beef.

226
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,590
W-Well, it looks more promising
 than I'd initially thought.

227
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,470
Guess we'll give it a try.

228
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:22,400
<i>There's no way he could turn that
cheap meat into anything decent—</i>

229
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,900
How can this be?

230
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,520
I can't... I can't stop eating!

231
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,780
The meat is most tender, but—

232
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,990
This sauce!

233
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,840
This fantastic minced onion sauce is an excellent spur to the appetite!

234
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,250
What <i>is</i> this?!

235
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:43,440
This full-bodied flavor must be from the red wine he added to the pan after the steak was done!

236
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:49,130
He deglazed the pan with it, 
then sautéed the onion in the pan!

237
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,410
Thickened with potato starch,

238
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:55,050
the creaminess of the sauce, 
coating the meat and rice, is irresistible!

239
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,720
Not to mention, the flavors are
rounded off by the burnt soy sauce!

240
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,520
He leveraged the burnt soy
 sauce to enhance the flavor!

241
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,770
Yukihira!

242
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,610
Seems like he tweaked the onions,
 a key ingredient in the Chaliapin steak,

243
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,610
and the sauce to boot.

244
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,450
But is that all?

245
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,520
<i>In the end, sauce is just sauce.</i>

246
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,200
<i>It's got nothing on my premium meat!</i>

247
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,610
Even though the meat and sauce
 are both strong in flavor,

248
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,420
I only get hungrier with every bite.

249
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,920
It sure does feel like I could eat this forever!

250
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,090
This hint of acidity...

251
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,090
Could it be?

252
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,430
Yes, the trick's in the rice.

253
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,300
The rice?

254
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,720
I mixed handmade pickled plum 
paste into the don's rice.

255
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,180
It's Refreshing Plum-Flavored Rice!

256
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,310
I knew it!

257
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,940
Pickled plums were behind
 this refreshing aftertaste!

258
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,360
The texture of this steak is so light, yet the flavors are so fragrant!

259
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,280
The superb sauce with its signature creaminess!

260
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,740
And the refreshing pickled plum-flavored rice!

261
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:01,250
Each component builds upon the others' flavor!

262
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,920
You can't stop shoveling it all in!

263
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,630
<i>Pickled plum? That's it?</i>

264
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,380
<i>He may have used a few gimmicks,</i>

265
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,220
<i>but it doesn't change the fact
 that each ingredient is cheap!</i>

266
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,890
Man, I'm already done!

267
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,350
How about seconds?

268
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,850
Can we have seconds?

269
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,020
The Rôti Don was fantastic as well,

270
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,520
but this don is better at
 making you want to eat more.

271
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,230
What?

272
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,190
Wh-What about my garlic rice?

273
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,110
None of you finished it!

274
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,650
Oh, yeah.

275
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,610
I was wondering what you
were going to do about the rice,

276
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:41,620
ever since Konishi-san said you'd be using marbled wagyu beef.

277
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,750
If you beef up the rice after amplifying the wagyu beef's umami,

278
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,830
of course the two would clash.

279
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,800
Your dish may <i>look</i> like a don, 
but it's not a real don.

280
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:00,300
The Don RS's leader said that the don has to be a complete package in one bowl.

281
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,140
Shut up.

282
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,020
I'm not interested in your twisted logic.

283
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,560
There's no way you could defeat my premium meat—

284
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,440
If you're not convinced,
 why not try it yourself?

285
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,650
Listen to the story my don tells.

286
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,860
Dig in.

287
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,270
<i>Yeah, he's right.</i>

288
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,140
<i>This don talks to you.</i>

289
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,860
<i>"Shovel in as much of me as you want."</i>

290
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,820
<i>Happy ninth birthday, Ikumi.</i>

291
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,530
<i>Thank you very much, Mother!</i>

292
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,830
<i>Darling, please stop!</i>

293
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,960
<i>Shut up!</i>

294
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,170
<i>The Mito clan has no need for
an heir with a ladylike demeanor!</i>

295
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,340
<i>Listen, Ikumi.</i>

296
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,920
<i>Be strong.</i>

297
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,880
<i>That's what you need to focus on.</i>

298
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,050
<i>Understand?</i>

299
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,440
<i>Shit. Why am I remembering that now?</i>

300
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,450
<i>It's because of this don.</i>

301
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,540
<i>This don's whispering to me
 that I can just be myself,</i>

302
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,960
<i>be who I really am.</i>

303
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,880
<i>Damn it!</i>

304
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,300
<i>Damn it!</i>

305
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,440
What an upset! The victor is Yukihira Souma!

306
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,070
Glad you liked it!

307
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,570
Souma-kun's amazing!

308
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,110
He did it!

309
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,570
Yukihira!

310
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,280
What?

311
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,080
I lost.

312
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,330
<i>I</i> lost.

313
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,870
<i>Erina-sama!</i>

314
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,800
Evict her from the kitchen we provided to her.

315
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,010
As you wish.

316
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,970
Hey, Nikumi.

317
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,430
Let me try some of your don too.

318
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,330
Who the hell do you think you are?!

319
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,520
Don't you dare call me that!

320
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,690
Why not?

321
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,900
It's pretty cute when you write it out in hiragana.

322
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,400
H-Huh?

323
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,650
I'm looking forward to working with you,

324
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,700
Nikumi-chan.

325
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,160
Wh-What did you say?

326
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,160
You idiot!

327
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,120
Don't forget to come to the club room!

328
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,250
Yukihira.

329
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,590
You're really something, man.

330
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,420
You're the only one who can 
lead the Don RS going forward.

331
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,800
You'll be the next "don" of the Don RS,

332
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,680
Yukihira!

333
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,170
<i>It's pretty cute.</i>

334
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,970
I-I'm coming in!

335
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,790
Oh, hey, Mito!

336
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,510
So you came.

337
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,640
Y-Yeah.

338
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,060
G-Guess Yukihira's not here yet.

339
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,360
I'm only here because he told me I had to come.

340
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,820
Oh, well...

341
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,240
<i>Huh?</i>

342
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,570
<i>But I'm not joining the Don RS.</i>

343
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,070
<i>What?!</i>

344
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:53,570
<i>Huh?</i>

345
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,950
<i>I just wanted to check it out.</i>

346
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,170
<i>But hey, thanks to the Don RS,</i>

347
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,210
<i>I came up with a new don menu that 
I could serve at our restaurant someday.</i>

348
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,830
<i>Well, good luck with everything.</i>

349
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,920
<i>I'll drop by sometimes.</i>

350
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,480
That's what he said.

351
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,380
But because our budget was increased,

352
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,590
let's work together to build up the Don RS!

353
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,010
You're the only one who can lead
 the Don RS going forward.

354
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,520
You'll be the next "don" of the Don RS,

355
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,520
Nikumi!

356
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,780
Shut up!

357
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,610
Don't you dare call me Nikumi!

358
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:34,490
It's said that from that day forward,
 Mito Ikumi-san became even more violent.

359
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,580
Next time on <i>Shokugeki no Souma</i>,

360
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,790
the eighth dish:

361
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,000
The Concerto of Inspiration and Imagination.

362
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,210
Looks delicious!

363
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,010
Cute!

364
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,510
What a demanding body you have.

365
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,120
I'm moe-moe-ed out.
