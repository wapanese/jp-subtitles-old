1
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,920
Well, sorry to spring this on you,

2
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,880
but I need you to show me 
how much you've grown...

3
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,210
or how much you haven't.

4
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,640
Let's have our first cooking 
contest in a long time...

5
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:39,760
Souma.

6
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,860
I was wondering why you'd
 showed up out of the blue.

7
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,190
That's what you're here for, old man?

8
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,480
Well? Are you in, or are you out?

9
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,360
As if you needed to ask!

10
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,950
Who would've guessed that Souma-kun

11
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,870
was the son of a former Elite Ten member?

12
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,550
I don't blame you for being surprised.

13
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,840
The only cooking techniques I taught Souma
 were ones that'd be useful in a diner.

14
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,180
Next to all the elites at this academy,

15
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,850
he must stick out like a sore thumb.

16
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,850
You're certainly right about that.

17
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,980
But from the very first time
 I faced off against Souma-kun,

18
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,480
I understood that he would
 stir things up around here.

19
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,570
Really?

20
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,240
Well then, for the theme...

21
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,830
Hey, Judge.

22
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,330
What do you have a hankering for?

23
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,330
Judge?

24
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,380
I see that the competitive streak runs in the family.

25
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,880
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, now does it?

26
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,920
Fumio-san?

27
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,260
Jouichirou asked me last night
 to oversee this match.

28
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,390
Well, this will be quite the spectacle.

29
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,600
Don't scare me like that!

30
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,440
Why are you even here, Isshiki?

31
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,070
I caught a whiff of an interesting match
 on the way back from my morning fieldwork.

32
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,320
Unfortunately for you, you may only observe.

33
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,480
After all, we can't have an even number of judges.

34
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,030
Hm?

35
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,200
T-Tadokoro?

36
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,870
Oh, Souma-kun.

37
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,850
Morning.

38
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,250
Whoa, what happened?

39
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,580
What's with the huge dark circles under your eyes?

40
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,880
Oh, those? Yeah, I'm really tired,

41
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,710
but whenever I try to fall asleep,
 I end up thinking about camp.

42
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,510
<i>We need to finish fishing ASAP and get cooking!</i>

43
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,060
<i>Watch where you're going!</i>

44
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,310
<i>What should I do? What should I do?!</i>

45
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,770
<i>I'm so sorry!</i>

46
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,680
I'm kind of amazed that I survived all that.

47
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,900
Well, it's all over now, so you should relax and get a good night's rest.

48
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,360
Oh, but this is perfect timing.

49
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,360
Come here, Megumi.

50
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,820
Huh?

51
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,870
With her here, we have three judges.

52
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,700
No objections, right?

53
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,870
Yeah.

54
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,660
Yup.

55
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,830
You know, I'm no spring chicken.

56
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,630
I can't eat anything heavy in the morning,

57
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,630
and the girl pulled an all-nighter.

58
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,880
With that in mind, the theme should be...

59
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,850
Serve us a dish that'll give us a boost
 and get us ready to start the day!

60
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,730
You may use anything you can find in this kitchen.

61
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,940
You have one hour.

62
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,690
Now, begin!

63
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,820
It has to be light and easy to eat,

64
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,320
and yeah, it has to be nutritious of course.

65
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:09,950
Okay!

66
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,790
Huh?

67
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,750
Uh...

68
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,710
Why are they competing against each other?

69
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,920
G'morning, Tadokoro-chan.

70
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,300
I guess you're finally awake.

71
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:22,880
Huh?

72
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,710
What?

73
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,460
Why?

74
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,050
What?

75
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,680
S-Souma-kun, your father was a member of the Elite Ten, right?

76
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,970
How can you possibly win?

77
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,100
Hey, it's not like this is
 the first time we've done this.

78
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,190
I think the first time I had a face-off with him was in sixth grade.

79
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,020
An elementary school student versus an adult?

80
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,360
I guess I <i>can</i> see Souma-kun doing that, but...

81
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,150
Hold on, have you ever beat him?

82
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,530
Oh, I can't really remember.

83
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,450
Not even once.

84
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,200
Quit pretending.

85
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,870
I think you're on over 500 losses by now.

86
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,690
No way! I've only lost 489 times!

87
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,380
So you <i>do</i> remember.

88
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,880
<i>A cooking match?</i>

89
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,760
<i>Yes. And I'd like you to be the judge.</i>

90
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,180
<i>Well, I'll get to see you in a match for the first time in a very long while,</i>

91
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,810
<i>so I'm fine with adjudicating.</i>

92
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:24,020
<i>But you'd better not take it easy on your opponent just because he's your son.</i>

93
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,980
<i>You needn't worry about that.</i>

94
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:31,660
<i>When it comes to Souma, 
I've never pulled any punches.</i>

95
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,960
<i>Huh? An apple?</i>

96
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,170
<i>Souma-kun...</i>

97
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:45,710
<i>He may be your father, but we're talking about the former second seat of the Elite Ten.</i>

98
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,130
<i>So why do you look so confident?</i>

99
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,590
<i>I see.</i>

100
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,720
<i>This is how he got started.</i>

101
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,050
<i>Souma-kun never backs down from a challenge,</i>

102
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,720
<i>no matter how insurmountable it may seem.</i>

103
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,850
<i>And now I know why.</i>

104
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,600
<i>He's been trying to surpass his father,</i>

105
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,100
<i>someone who far exceeds his own abilities,</i>

106
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,070
<i>even after 489 losses.</i>

107
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,830
Who'll be the first to finish?

108
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,210
Thank you for waiting!

109
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,210
That looks like...

110
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,210
An apple risotto.

111
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,090
Go on, have a taste!

112
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,050
A risotto?!

113
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,460
It's true!

114
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,340
I can see the finely diced apples.

115
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,340
<i>Fruit in a risotto?</i>

116
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,350
<i>He sure likes surprising us, doesn't he?</i>

117
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,930
A refreshing aroma that's both sweet and tart.

118
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,400
Did he also use lemons in this dish?

119
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,230
He did.

120
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,860
The dish's fragrance is invigorating.

121
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:53,070
Just a whiff of it is enough to shake my leaden stomach awake and rouse my appetite.

122
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,450
It's enough to banish any fatigue.

123
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,370
An apple risotto, huh?

124
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,410
Well, why don't we see how it tastes?

125
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,800
<i>The apples lend a crisp texture
 and a mellow sweetness.</i>

126
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,630
<i>The simmered onions impart
 a silky texture to the risotto.</i>

127
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:18,760
<i>Meanwhile, the crunchy bacon accents the gentle apple flavor that permeates the entire dish.</i>

128
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,700
<i>It's as though it's...</i>

129
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,630
<i>gently waking me up from a long sleep.</i>

130
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,970
<i>Such a gentle kiss...</i>

131
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,180
<i>from the prince of apples!</i>

132
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,970
Apple...

133
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,730
It's delicious!

134
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,100
Now try seasoning it with black pepper.

135
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,440
It makes for a novel flavor that's just as good!

136
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,400
Let's see.

137
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,120
The subtle sweetness of the apples and onions...

138
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,540
...contrasts with the peppery
 bite of the black pepper!

139
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,040
The black specks on the white dish...

140
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,090
...create a contrast in both taste and appearance.

141
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,210
It's like a waltz in black and white!

142
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,920
I think I'm going to melt!

143
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,890
It feels like it's sinking into my sleep-deprived body!

144
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,100
You're getting vitamins, fats, and carbohydrates.

145
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,610
The rice is on the soft side, 
so it's gentle on your stomach.

146
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,070
It's perfect for eating right after you wake up.

147
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,120
But there's something I find puzzling.

148
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,160
What is it?

149
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:06,120
The rice and onions have been infused with the flavor of apples,

150
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,210
but if the apples had been cooked that long,

151
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,420
they should've become mush.

152
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,840
Instead, they still have a crisp texture.

153
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,170
You're right.

154
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,590
How's that possible?

155
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,800
About that...

156
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,640
I used this!

157
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,180
Apple juice?!

158
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,470
While I was simmering the sauteed rice and onions,

159
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,600
I added the juice bit by bit as the dish was reduced.

160
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,770
The diced apples were added later, and they were cooked just long enough to warm them.

161
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,730
That's why they retain their raw texture.

162
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,190
<i>I see.</i>

163
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,030
<i>What an innovative idea.</i>

164
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,360
<i>The flavor of apples permeates the dish,</i>

165
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,700
<i>and it was the apple juice that was behind it!</i>

166
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,700
<i>Even though he was presented with the theme right before he started,</i>

167
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,830
<i>he was able to produce a dish 
on the fly that was spot-on.</i>

168
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,880
<i>Is there any limit to his talent?</i>

169
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,670
<i>The apple risotto was an excellent
 response to the assignment!</i>

170
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,260
<i>I can hardly imagine a better dish.</i>

171
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,270
<i>What a terrifying man.</i>

172
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:17,740
<i>I can sense how he might be able to surpass</i>

173
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,450
<i>this near-perfect dish by Yukihira Souma with ease!</i>

174
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,700
Thank you for waiting.

175
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,660
Now, please eat.

176
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,830
This is revolting!

177
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:34,080
It's as if 50,000 blue crabs had run rampant through idyllic farmland!

178
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,000
Absolutely horrid!

179
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,380
<i>The dishes he prepared yesterday</i>

180
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,830
<i>were all meticulous and polished.</i>

181
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,650
<i>What would he make for a contest?</i>

182
00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:01,190
I'm honored to witness a dish made by a predecessor of the Elite Ten.

183
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,660
During his time here, Jouichirou was well-known for his inventive dishes.

184
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,790
Take a long, hard look!

185
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,330
Have a taste.

186
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,330
It's Jouichirou's Special Rich Ramen.

187
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,710
R...

188
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,180
Ramen?!

189
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,170
Ramen for breakfast?!

190
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,010
Wow. The broth looks really rich.

191
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,550
<i>I've heard of places where ramen 
is eaten in the morning,</i>

192
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,970
<i>but this appears to be made
with a thick seafood-based broth.</i>

193
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:34,600
<i>This dish is too much for the sleep-deprived
 Tadokoro-chan and the elderly Fumio-san.</i>

194
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,140
Jouichirou!

195
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,980
Your obsession with novelty has gone too far!

196
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,990
I've warned you about this before!

197
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,490
You would serve up untested
recipes with bizarre ingredients

198
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,990
at a Cooking Battle without any hesitation!

199
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,790
And that's why you would lose
 Cooking Battles from time to time!

200
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,660
I <i>was</i> pretty ornery back then.

201
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,540
As if you've changed at all!

202
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,290
Hm?

203
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,000
Fumio-san, the broth may <i>look</i> rich,

204
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,090
but it has a surprisingly light and mellow scent.

205
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,260
You're right.

206
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,100
Well anyway, let's see how this dish fares.

207
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,230
It's... not bad.

208
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,900
Yuzu citrus was kneaded into these noodles.

209
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,200
Despite how rich the ramen is, I can keep eating.

210
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,830
<i>Or, rather, I...</i>

211
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,240
<i>...I...</i>

212
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,440
<i>...just...</i>

213
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,480
<i>...can't stop!</i>

214
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,580
The broth is a combination of
 soy milk and scorched miso.

215
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,420
But how would that alone be enough to produce such depth of flavor?

216
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,890
The ebi-imo taro I grated into the soy milk 
and miso has an elastic texture and a rich taste.

217
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,350
Doing so imparted a creamy depth to the broth.

218
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,450
I feel like I'm being warmed from within.

219
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:04,190
It must be the effect of the chili oil,
 grated ginger, and garlic.

220
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,930
The mild soy milk masks 
the bite of those ingredients,

221
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,780
letting them gradually warm you up.

222
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,720
A lot of work and attention to detail went into these toppings too.

223
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,400
Lotus and burdock roots were thinly sliced and fried to a golden color.

224
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,140
Carrots and turnips were grilled over charcoal until lightly scorched,

225
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,630
then seasoned with rock salt to bring out their natural sweetness!

226
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,680
Just like in French cuisine,

227
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,800
each ingredient was prepared using a method uniquely suited to it,

228
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,700
in order to bring out its flavor.

229
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,020
And to top it off, he used tempeh!

230
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,980
Tempeh?

231
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,940
A fermented soy-based food product originating in Indonesia.

232
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,580
It's made by fermenting soybeans with tempeh mold,

233
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,840
which is found on hibiscus and banana leaves.

234
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,910
Tempeh is a traditional food that's been made for over 400 years.

235
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,000
It's light, but at the same time very filling.

236
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,000
It's almost like char siu pork!

237
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,380
The texture of tempeh is close to that of meat,

238
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,380
so it's often part of vegetarian and macrobiotic diets.

239
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,640
People who don't eat meat or dairy products can still enjoy tempeh.

240
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,260
For this dish, I prepared the tempeh by cooking it in soy sauce and sake.

241
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,520
Could this be... a vegetarian broth?

242
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,960
That's right.

243
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,560
It's made with kelp and shiitake mushrooms. No meat involved!

244
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,050
When I was traveling overseas a long time ago,

245
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,690
I met a priest who was lamenting

246
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,950
that he had to abstain from meat and fish
 for several weeks for religious reasons.

247
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,200
<i>I want to eat something filling!</i>

248
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:42,040
This ramen is based on what I learned through trial and error while making dishes for him.

249
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,420
<i>I see.</i>

250
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:49,230
<i>The umami components of kelp and shiitake mushrooms have a synergistic effect when used in combination.</i>

251
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:53,550
<i>It makes it possible to attain a rich broth without using bonito fish.</i>

252
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,130
Wait, Jouichirou!

253
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,810
If that's the case, then this ramen...

254
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:03,100
You achieved this much complexity in flavor without using any meat or fish?

255
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,520
It's easy to use animal products to create umami and depth of flavor.

256
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,530
But this is a rich ramen
 that uses neither meat nor fish!

257
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,950
Isn't that more interesting?

258
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,880
<i>What a guy!</i>

259
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,040
<i>By combining the flavor of soy and other vegetables,</i>

260
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,590
<i>he created a dish that is deeply satisfying.</i>

261
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:31,420
<i>How many ideas are crammed into this single dish?</i>

262
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:37,300
<i>It contains the knowledge of a man
 who's spent a lifetime traveling the world.</i>

263
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,310
<i>Even though every bite leaves quite an impression,</i>

264
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,730
<i>you never get overwhelmed!</i>

265
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,680
<i>What a pleasant, perfect spiciness!</i>

266
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,730
<i>I can just feel the energy coursing through my veins!</i>

267
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,480
<i>Ah, I feel so warm inside!</i>

268
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,650
<i>My cells are rejuvenating!</i>

269
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,740
<i>Rejuvenating!</i>

270
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,740
<i>Rejuvenating!</i>

271
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,910
<i>Rejuvenating!</i>

272
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,990
Thank you for the food!

273
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,250
The clock's been turned too far back!

274
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,750
Let's get down to the judging!

275
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,540
Thank God, I was just seeing things!

276
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,740
But you <i>do</i> look somewhat younger.

277
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,750
In fact, you're kind of glowing.

278
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,130
Yukihira Souma or Jouichirou.

279
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,340
Set forth the dish that was 
more delicious in front of you!

280
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,510
It's unanimous.

281
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,770
The victor is Jouichirou!

282
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,230
Glad you liked it!

283
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,730
<i>Both demonstrated more than sufficient surprises,</i>

284
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,070
<i>innovation, and consideration 
of the diner in the morning.</i>

285
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,030
<i>But after tasting that ramen so full of vitality,</i>

286
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,710
<i>Yukihira's dish feels lacking in comparison.</i>

287
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,500
It's a complete victory for Jouichirou!

288
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,130
Souma-kun, your dish was certainly delicious,

289
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:55,050
but it seemed a bit lackluster to me.

290
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,430
It <i>is</i> morning,

291
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,630
but I'd just finished fieldwork.

292
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:02,890
I guess I wanted something more substantial.

293
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,390
Jouichirou-san's dish hit the spot.

294
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,230
<i>I see.</i>

295
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:13,140
<i>When I made that dish, all I thought about was
how to minimize discomfort and meet their needs.</i>

296
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,070
Minimize

297
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:18,700
<i>On the other hand, Dad aimed to maximize their enjoyment by fulfilling their desires.</i>

298
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,570
Maximize

299
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,580
But it's good to see you've grown up a little bit.

300
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,460
Apple risotto, huh? Not bad.

301
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,380
Listen up, Souma.

302
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,060
While you're at Tohtsuki, you'll find
 yourself with plenty of battles to fight.

303
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,840
Until the next time you lose to me,

304
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,630
you'd better not lose to anyone else.

305
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,080
So they communicate through their cooking, huh?

306
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,640
What a pair those two make.

307
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,530
But all that aside...

308
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,020
Yeah?

309
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,400
This is your 490th loss, huh, Souma?

310
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,900
Hey!

311
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,320
Another win for me.

312
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,190
It's not as satisfying when I don't have a single defeat to my name.

313
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,070
Shut up!

314
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,530
I'll show you next time!

315
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,450
Th-They're taking notes?!

316
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,120
Have they been recording every single win and loss since the beginning?

317
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,370
They're oddly meticulous about things like that.

318
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,130
<i>So you've been facing him over
 and over again, Souma-kun.</i>

319
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,590
<i>You've been up against this amazing father
 and experienced frustration many times over.</i>

320
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,100
Souma-kun, I'm going to keep trying too!

321
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,260
Huh?

322
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,340
Uh, okay.

323
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,730
Your father's amazing.

324
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,400
I guess that's the power of the second seat!

325
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,150
I guess.

326
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,780
It's not like my goal's changed, though.

327
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,620
I want to see what it's like up at the top,
 where not even Dad's been.

328
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:49,370
This has only made me even more fired up!

329
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,830
Souma-kun...

330
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,060
All right!

331
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,220
Let's aim for the Elite Ten together, Tadokoro.

332
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:54,830
Huh?

333
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,580
What?!

334
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,050
That's impossible for me!

335
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,260
Don't be silly!

336
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,810
What, leaving already?

337
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,150
Do you ever relax?

338
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,030
You should give him some more advice.

339
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,650
I'm pretty laissez-faire about parenting.

340
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,490
He'll figure it out.

341
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,120
Yeah, right.

342
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,580
That match was meant to encourage him, wasn't it?

343
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,330
Since the Autumn Selection is coming up.

344
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,250
Hm?

345
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,880
I just wanted to see my son's crestfallen face again.

346
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,840
You could be more honest, you know.

347
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,010
Well, I'll leave it at that.

348
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,870
Besides, I had an errand to take care of at Tohtsuki.

349
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,850
An errand?

350
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,390
Oh, it's nothing important.

351
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,630
Well, later, Fumio-san.

352
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,820
I'll come by sometime to cook for you.

353
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,030
My goodness.

354
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,420
No matter how old you get, 
you'll never shake off your wanderlust.

355
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,160
My apologies, Erina-sama.

356
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,120
I'm sure you're tired from the training camp,

357
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,340
but here is the schedule for today.

358
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,800
The owner and head chef of Kishoan will be arriving shortly to give you their regards.

359
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,260
They'd like you to taste their new menu.

360
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,510
Following that will be a group luncheon with Food Executive Company board members...

361
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,850
Stop the car!

362
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,720
Erina-sama?

363
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,580
Ah, no, it's nothing.

364
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,670
What?!

365
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,400
Jouichirou-san already left?

366
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,640
Wh-When did he leave?

367
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,550
Just now.

368
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,680
I have no idea where he's off to, though.

369
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,060
He's too footloose.

370
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,440
He should've at least let us say goodbye.

371
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,310
Aw, I wanted to let him try some eggs from my Polar Star chickens.

372
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,820
I wanted his advice.

373
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,320
And I wanted to thank him for the breakfast ramen.

374
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,160
Ramen?

375
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,490
Yeah...

376
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:57,120
Souma-kun and Jouichirou-san had a cooking face-off this morning.

377
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,110
What?!

378
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,070
How could you?!

379
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,720
You should've called us!

380
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,080
Sorry! Please forgive me!

381
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,500
We're not going to forgive you!

382
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,500
By the way, Yukihira.

383
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,240
Jouichirou had a message for you.

384
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,090
A message?

385
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,130
Yeah.

386
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,550
"Air out the restaurant once in a while."

387
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,260
The restaurant?

388
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,510
Why don't you go home for a bit
 during the next holiday?

389
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,740
Holiday, huh.

390
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,990
I wonder what's going to happen
 to this shopping district.

391
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,870
Next time on <i>Shokugeki no Souma</i>,

392
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,790
the seventeenth dish:

393
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,150
The Sensuous Karaage.

394
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,010
It's only planned for now.

395
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,010
Crap. I haven't seen even
 a single car come this way.
