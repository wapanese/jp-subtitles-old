1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,390
Hey, you hungry?

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,110
What are you thinking, ice cream maybe?

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,280
Nah, I want something more filling.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,350
Definitely!

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,010
I want something filling too.

6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,670
So what do you want to eat?

7
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,200
Kurase Mayumi

8
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,200
Kurase Mayumi

9
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,200
First-Year, High School

10
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,200
First-Year, High School

11
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,240
Meat!

12
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,740
Hey, good idea!

13
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,740
What do you want?

14
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,200
Meat!

15
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,370
<i>Would you like some?</i>

16
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,290
<i>Grilled squid tentacles in a peanut butter dressing.</i>

17
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,210
<i>Here, dig in.</i>

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,640
Every single day,

19
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,850
when we pass by this place, 
you stop and stare.

20
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,520
Huh?

21
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,680
Th-That's not—

22
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,140
Don't lie!

23
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,230
You were thinking about Yukihira again.

24
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,360
That's why, back in junior high,
 I <i>told</i> you to ask him out

25
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,150
when you learned that you'd be going to different high schools!

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,740
Oh man, sorry!

27
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,910
I'm sorry, Mayu!

28
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,380
Well, it might not be too late, y'know?

29
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,910
Maybe try to win him over by calling or texting him.

30
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,260
No way.

31
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,370
I'm a very plain girl.

32
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,040
Something like that would never work.

33
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,920
Oh, hey, Kurase.

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,420
Been a while.

35
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,430
Yukihira?!

36
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,550
Long time no see, you guys.

37
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,260
You should've told us you were coming back!

38
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,850
Are you going to reopen the diner?

39
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,100
Nah, I just came by to air the place out.

40
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,060
Whoa!

41
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,480
Yukihira's open again!

42
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,510
What?!

43
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,270
It's true!

44
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,110
Souma-chan, make me something!

45
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:34,900
Me too!

46
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,530
For me too!

47
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,570
Me too, please!

48
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,070
I miss your diner's cooking so much.

49
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,530
All right!

50
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,290
I'll have to make a supply run first.

51
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,880
Diner Yukihira's gonna be open once again for a limited time!

52
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,100
Your Chicken-and-Egg Rice Bowl
 and Ma Po Tofu Sets!

53
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,140
Yahoo!

54
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,810
I've waited so long for this!

55
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,020
Say, where's your dad?

56
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,520
You're not with him?

57
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,940
Oh, I ran into him the other day.

58
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,780
I guess he's off globetrotting again.

59
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,490
Souma-chan, can I add sauteed snow pea sprouts to my order?

60
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,950
Sure thing!

61
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,070
<i>Yukihira-kun...</i>

62
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,700
<i>A cooking contest?</i>

63
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,390
<i>He's going to face off against his dad and needs a judge.</i>

64
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,540
<i>You've never been over to his place, right?</i>

65
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,750
<i>You can eat really yummy food!</i>

66
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,950
<i>Better not pass this up!</i>

67
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,930
<i>I've been in the same school as
 Yukihira-kun since kindergarten,</i>

68
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,390
<i>but we've never really talked.</i>

69
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,730
<i>Dig in!</i>

70
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,060
<i>Thank you!</i>

71
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,980
<i>I don't have any special skills or hobbies.</i>

72
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,020
<i>I'm pretty ordinary. So to me...</i>

73
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,240
<i>you're really amazing.</i>

74
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,330
<i>It's only been two months since we graduated from junior high,</i>

75
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,540
<i>but you already look a bit more mature.</i>

76
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,670
<i>It feels like you're even more out of reach now.</i>

77
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,880
Thanks for the food!

78
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,880
Thanks!

79
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,000
Thanks for coming.

80
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,640
Huh. Is it me or are there a lot fewer people around than normal?

81
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,850
This street should be busier at this time of day.

82
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,770
You guys run this shopping district.
 What's going on?

83
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,270
Are mega-investors really that great?!

84
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,480
Calm down, Tomi-chan!

85
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,490
What happened here, Chairman?

86
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,110
It's pretty simple.

87
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,080
About a month ago,

88
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,670
the station's commercial complex completed its renovations.

89
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,540
Oh, yeah, it's a lot nicer now.

90
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,880
Well, it's another one of those
 train station shopping malls.

91
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,750
They have a bunch of stores selling clothes, books, and other goods.

92
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,380
And there's this pretty popular shop that sells karaage.

93
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,510
It's supposed to be really good.

94
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,260
Huh.

95
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,640
Have you guys tried it?

96
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,430
Yeah, my parents brought some home the other day.

97
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,260
Mine too.

98
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,520
It was good, yeah.

99
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,730
They showed it on TV the other day.

100
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,240
<i>It's crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside!</i>

101
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,200
<i>Well, that's a 10 out of 10 from me!</i>

102
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,450
All the customers are going to the in-station mall for the karaage.

103
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,420
Commuters don't pass through
 this street any more.

104
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,040
My bento store's sales have plummeted.

105
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,300
I'm not sure how much longer we can stay open.

106
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,800
Seriously?

107
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,890
Maybe you shouldn't be
 wasting time chowing down.

108
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,720
Seconds.

109
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,140
Hey.

110
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,970
I guess it's a sign of the times.

111
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,640
This shopping district may be on its last legs.

112
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,360
Well, I'll figure something out.

113
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,770
Figure what out, exactly?

114
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,750
Their main attraction is the karaage, right?

115
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,360
So let's cook up a new karaage here
 that'll knock their socks off.

116
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,410
What?

117
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,530
That's impossible, Souma-chan!

118
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,700
They have us beat in everything.

119
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,580
Money, marketing, you name it.

120
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,210
You don't want to pick a fight with them!

121
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,420
It's better than sitting around and doing nothing.

122
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,630
Customers are insatiable, y'know?

123
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,630
<i>Yukihira's open!</i>

124
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,550
<i>Souma-chan, make me something!</i>

125
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,680
If you make something really good,

126
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,470
they'll track it down.

127
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,020
I'm one of you guys.

128
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,060
I can't let this place become a ghost town.

129
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,020
Let's steal our customers back with a new karaage recipe and revive the shopping district!

130
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,620
Well said, Souma-chan!

131
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,700
You're not the future owner of Yukihira for nothing!

132
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,740
We can count on you!

133
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,240
All right, I'm gonna use my vacation
 to come up with a great dish!

134
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,200
This is going to take a lot of prep work.

135
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,710
Okay, first off...

136
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,000
Guess I'll get back to work.

137
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,380
Not that there's much to do.

138
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,170
Thanks, Souma-chan.

139
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,760
Your face is saying, 
"I'd like to help Yukihira-kun too,

140
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,180
but I doubt I can be of any help, ugh."

141
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,890
You're an open book.

142
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,180
Hey, Yukihira.

143
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,350
You need a taste-tester, don't you?

144
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,850
Huh?

145
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:48,610
She's not in any clubs, 
and I bet she's got good taste!

146
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,480
Oh...

147
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,280
What?!

148
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,940
Wh-Why me?!

149
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,780
I don't know anything about cooking!

150
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,610
Now, now.

151
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,280
You never know, input from
 a layperson might be important.

152
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,500
But why <i>my</i> opinion—

153
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,460
"I'll try my best!"

154
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,120
Oh, okay.

155
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,790
Thanks for helping me out, Kurase.

156
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,000
We'd better check out their karaage first.

157
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,630
Then we'll brainstorm our menu.

158
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,130
Okay!

159
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,510
I'll see you tomorrow morning!

160
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,180
Are you sure about this?

161
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,520
I'm not discerning enough to be a taste-tester.

162
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,400
You've been a judge for a cooking contest.

163
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,820
This is totally different.

164
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,550
We have to come up with a brand new dish.

165
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,610
Listen, Mayu.

166
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,940
This is your chance!

167
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,360
Huh?

168
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,820
A guy and a girl sharing the same goal,

169
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,220
in a room by themselves...

170
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,250
Of course you're gonna get close!

171
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,420
G-Get close...

172
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,500
Time to get your game face on, Mayu!

173
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,960
Aki-chan, you're scaring me!

174
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,050
<i>Hm...</i>

175
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,090
<i>Karaage, huh?</i>

176
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,010
<i>We've made that here plenty of times,</i>

177
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,470
<i>but maybe I need some special insights</i>

178
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,270
<i>into take-out dishes like I did for the buffet assignment at camp.</i>

179
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,190
<i>Who do I know that might have
 that kind of knowledge?</i>

180
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,360
<i>Karaage...</i>

181
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,570
<i>Chicken...</i>

182
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,190
<i>Meat...</i>

183
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,830
Man, who's bugging me now?

184
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,330
I'm trying to enjoy my break here.

185
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,910
Huh?

186
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,080
Who <i>is</i> this?

187
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,210
I don't recognize this number at all.

188
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,210
Hello?

189
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,340
Hey, Nikumi?

190
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,400
It's Yukihira.

191
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Wh-Why do you have my number?!

192
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,670
Oh, sorry 'bout that.

193
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,170
I asked Konishi-san for it.

194
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,350
S-So why are you calling me?

195
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,100
I have to come up with
 a new karaage dish pronto.

196
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,270
I'm back home right now.

197
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,230
Do you think you can come over and help?

198
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,230
Come over? To your home?

199
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,810
Did you already have vacation plans?

200
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,190
W-Well, I guess I gotta bail you out, don't I?

201
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,570
I'm <i>super</i> busy, but I'll come!

202
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,990
I'm busy, but I <i>guess</i> I can make it!

203
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,820
It's not like I have any choice here, do I?

204
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,540
Hey, if you're busy, I can ask someone else.

205
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,990
I said I'd come, didn't I?!

206
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,640
What's this run-down place?

207
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,350
Okay, so Diner Yukihira...

208
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,120
<i>Maybe I should've picked out a more normal outfit.</i>

209
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,610
<i>Nah, I'm fine being me!</i>

210
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,410
Sorry, Kurase,

211
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,360
can you hang on for a second?

212
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,580
S-Sure, I'm fine!

213
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,370
<i>I'm so nervous.</i>

214
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,330
I hope I'll be able to help him.

215
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,310
Get close!

216
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,290
Get close, okay, Mayu?!

217
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,300
<i>Aki-chan, don't pressure me!</i>

218
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,720
Hey!

219
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,970
<i>What?!</i>

220
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:06,430
This is Yukihira Souma's place, right?

221
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,810
Y-Yes!

222
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,690
Oh, hey, Nikumi!

223
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,690
Thanks for coming!

224
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:16,150
Right, this is Kurase. She's one of
 my old classmates from junior high.

225
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,570
I asked her to be a taste-tester.

226
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,070
Huh?

227
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,860
This is one of my classmates from high school.

228
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,530
She's a meat expert.

229
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,820
You can call her Nikumi.

230
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,700
"Nikumi"?

231
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,490
D-Don't spread that nickname around!

232
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,160
I'll punch you!

233
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,920
Anyway, now that everyone's here,

234
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,460
let's go check out enemy territory!

235
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,840
Welcome!

236
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,010
Come try the karaage
 that's the talk of the town!

237
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,930
Crap, what should I wear?

238
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,390
Should I try to be more refined?

239
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,140
What about just being myself?

240
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,060
Or is that no good?

241
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,560
Dammit!

242
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,020
Bah!

243
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,960
Wow!

244
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,120
This place is so huge now!

245
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,620
It looks pretty trendy too.

246
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,230
It's no surprise that our shopping
 district's on the ropes!

247
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,460
Th-This is no laughing matter, Yukihira-kun.

248
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,880
<i>Whatever! It's not like I expected to be all alone with Yukihira in his home!</i>

249
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,170
<i>The reason I'm here is to think up a new dish!</i>

250
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,680
<i>She said her name's Mito-san.</i>

251
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,640
<i>She's like an actress, or a model.</i>

252
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,310
<i>I've never met anyone this sexy before.</i>

253
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,140
<i>High school students are amazing.</i>

254
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,600
<i>I'm nothing like her.</i>

255
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,860
<i>That's right.</i>

256
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,570
<i>It's nothing out of the ordinary
 to have someone else around.</i>

257
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,740
<i>So why am I so irritated?</i>

258
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,120
<i>He said this girl's his childhood
 friend or whatever,</i>

259
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,370
<i>but is she his type?</i>

260
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,700
<i>Is that it?!</i>

261
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,830
<i>Oh, could Mito-san be Yukihira-kun's girlfriend?!</i>

262
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,500
What're you staring at, huh?!

263
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,170
S-Sorry!

264
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,430
Hey, don't be mean to Kurase, Nikumi.

265
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,180
Quit calling me that!

266
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,800
Are you upset that I called you on vacation?

267
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,970
Not really.

268
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,470
Sorry, Kurase.

269
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,640
It's okay.

270
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,390
<i>Well, they're meeting each other for the first time.</i>

271
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:17,610
<i>I should try to smooth things over by putting myself between them!</i>

272
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,610
Hey!

273
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,780
Isn't that it?

274
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,940
The karaage place.

275
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,400
The line starts here!

276
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,910
Thank you for waiting.

277
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,870
You can get a discount on a box of twelve!

278
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,450
Welcome!

279
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,810
Come to Mozuya for karaage!

280
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,540
This is Mozuya!

281
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,850
So Mozuya's the karaage place 
you were talking about.

282
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,090
You know of it?

283
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,500
They're a really famous chain in Kansai.

284
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,130
That's Nakamozu Kinu.

285
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,800
She's the owner of the Mozuya chain.

286
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,010
They started out in Kyoto and now have branches all across Kansai.

287
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:55,140
They've won the National Karaage Competition
 three years in a row, a historic feat,

288
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,100
and everyone says they'll win this year as well.

289
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,810
I see.

290
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,320
A lot of the customers are housewives.

291
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,680
Yeah, and there'll be even
 more people in the evening.

292
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,990
The packaging is stylish, 
so it's really popular with the ladies.

293
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,240
A lot of people even take the train here just to buy it.

294
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,360
So they have a nice storefront with a bunch of staff.

295
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,080
The business looks good.

296
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,040
Huh?

297
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,340
Chairman?

298
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,540
Whoa!

299
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:22,880
Souma-chan?

300
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,010
What're you doing here?

301
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,670
O-Oh, I was thinking maybe I could do something to help out.

302
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,470
What's with the getup?

303
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,850
We're behind enemy lines.

304
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:34,310
It'll be dangerous if they realize who I am.

305
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,180
How so?

306
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,270
You should be more careful, Souma-chan.

307
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,560
There's no need to skulk about.

308
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,480
Why not line up with pride, Chairman?

309
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,400
Are you folks from the shopping district?

310
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,820
Would you like to try some?

311
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,310
Really?

312
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,290
Don't mind if I do.

313
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,630
<i>Inside the crisp, light batter,</i>

314
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,710
<i>there's fat bursting out of the plump chicken</i>

315
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,550
<i>and making war inside your mouth with umami!</i>

316
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,050
<i>It's like umami arrows are raining down on you!</i>

317
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,220
Wow!

318
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,020
How do you make this taste so good?

319
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,350
Let me tell you!

320
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,650
We're using Omi local chicken.

321
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,320
They're a premium breed fed only on herbs.

322
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,610
The finishing touch is Mozuya's proprietary
 super secret soy sauce marinade!

323
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:33,070
Along with grated apples, we use more than a dozen ingredients in the marinade to dress up the chicken.

324
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:37,540
We then fry up the chicken nice and crispy by exposing it to air as it cooks!

325
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:43,000
There are those who call our chicken "The World's Greatest Karaage."

326
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,550
Are you sure you want to tell us all this?

327
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,500
After all, we're here to spy on you.

328
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,240
Oh, I don't mind at all!

329
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,930
I doubt you'd ever manage to duplicate our recipe.

330
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,680
Still, what a pathetic loser of a man you are,

331
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,220
relying on women and children to save you.

332
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,890
You just stood by and watched
 as the customers left one by one.

333
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,230
Don't you have <i>any</i> self-respect?

334
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:11,570
Oh, but I'd be worried about my business too
 if someone depressing like you were on <i>my</i> storefront!

335
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,950
<i>This weakling reminds me of someone I know.</i>

336
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,160
The next don of the Don RS is you!

337
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,090
I guess you're really confident, huh?

338
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:31,880
So if our shopping district were to come up
 with karaage that's better than yours,

339
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,220
it'd be a <i>huge</i> embarrassment
 to Mozuya-san, huh?

340
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,350
You talk big, <i>boy</i>,

341
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,480
but don't you kid yourself for a moment!

342
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,230
What could a mere child like you possibly do?

343
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,190
Hm? Well?

344
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:52,510
Well, a wimpy shopping district that has no competitive streak or shred of imagination

345
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,240
deserves to wither away and die, no?

346
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:01,000
I hope you'll continue your
 patronage of Mozuya at the station!

347
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,340
Please come again.

348
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,120
Th-That was scary.

349
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,550
I felt like I was in a yakuza film.

350
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,520
Do you want to try and see how far we can get
 by doing what the competition's doing?

351
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,720
Yeah, let's give it a shot.

352
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,270
<i>Neither of them are discouraged in the least.</i>

353
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,770
<i>They sure are tough!</i>

354
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,730
All right!

355
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,810
Operation Defeat Mozuya!

356
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:27,730
On with the trials!

357
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:32,110
Knead the marinade into chunks of breast meat.

358
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,360
Like Mozuya, we'll add ingredients like grated apples and onions,

359
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,670
and modify it with ginger for added measure.

360
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,330
This'll form the base of the karaage's flavor.

361
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,790
Make sure the marinade coats
 each piece, and let it sit.

362
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,250
This is just a test, so we'll fry it right away,

363
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:50,210
but I bet Mozuya lets their chicken rest
 in the marinade for about ten hours.

364
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,500
Ten hours? That long?

365
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,340
Then dredge the pieces in katakuri starch.

366
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,430
Dusting off the excess starch is key to frying the chicken up nice and crisp.

367
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,340
I see.

368
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,180
And here I thought it would taste better
 with more of it left on.

369
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,140
Okay, the temperature's perfect.

370
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,480
Let's go!

371
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,900
Test number 1, complete!

372
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,690
Kurase, try it.

373
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:14,400
Okay.

374
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,290
It's delicious!

375
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,670
It's great, Yukihira-kun!

376
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:33,800
But it doesn't pack the same punch as Mozuya's.

377
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,560
That high-quality marinade contains soy sauce,
 garlic, and many different spices.

378
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,010
All of them combine to create a complex flavor.

379
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:47,020
I bet it took them years to perfect that recipe.

380
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,020
We're going up against something like that?

381
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:54,270
Hey, is there some reason it has to be chicken?

382
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,650
Even if we stick to meat, there's beef, pork—

383
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,530
really, there's all sorts of options.

384
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,700
Huh, you're right.

385
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,790
How about A-5 beef?

386
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,830
In terms of quality and brand name recognition,

387
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,750
we'd totally win.

388
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,420
But isn't it really expensive?

389
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,590
I'll give you the special Mito
 conglomerate discount,

390
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,800
since you're a classmate and all.

391
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,050
I'll get you the best ingredients,
 and to hell with the profits!

392
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,430
Hold on, let me figure out the price.

393
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,050
<i>Thanks a ton, Nikumi!</i>

394
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,720
<i>If we can keep the price down to about 1,000 yen per 100 grams—</i>

395
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,060
That'll be 3,500 yen per 100 grams!

396
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,810
You know what? Never mind.

397
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:32,440
Huh?

398
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,700
Don't hold back just because it's so cheap!

399
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,530
Uh, no, I'm not worried about it being too <i>cheap</i>.

400
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,740
How about you, Kurase? Any ideas?

401
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,530
Huh?

402
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:43,280
Um, well...

403
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,240
C-Can you capitalize somehow on the fact
 that we're a shopping district?

404
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,750
Oh... Um...

405
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,580
I don't really have any specific ideas.

406
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,380
I'm sorry.

407
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,630
Customers use the station as a hub to catch trains and buses.

408
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,130
And customers come to the station building for other reasons.

409
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,390
This location gives us a twofold
 advantage in terms of customer draw.

410
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:08,560
It was the right decision to choose this spot.

411
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,780
Of course, it's only to be expected,

412
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,560
given that we contracted your consulting services for our Kanto expansion.

413
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,900
Don't let your guard down.

414
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,860
You haven't established your brand in Kanto yet.

415
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,990
Let me know if you catch the slightest whiff of any potential issues.

416
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,790
For someone so young, you're such a worrywart!

417
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,490
We're making steady progress.

418
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:33,960
Observing the market and reacting optimally as soon as possible is a basic rule of business.

419
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,500
Well, if anything,

420
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,960
there's this brat from the shopping district who's trying to pull something.

421
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,420
Brat?

422
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,130
Oh, it's nothing to worry about.

423
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,760
At any rate, the store's getting a constant stream of customers!

424
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,020
It's only a matter of time before
 Mozuya takes over this entire city!

425
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,020
Just in case,

426
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,020
keep an eye on what he's up to.

427
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,440
Don't forget to follow up with me, got it?

428
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,190
Sure, sure.

429
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,320
Kids these days are all so uppity.

430
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,890
None of these are bad per se,

431
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,160
but they're not great either.

432
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,980
We've tried changing the marinade and the batter...

433
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,910
...but none of them have stood out so far.

434
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,870
<i>What should I do?</i>

435
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,880
<i>What kind of karaage will let 
us take back our customers?</i>

436
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,710
<i>If we don't succeed, the Sumire
 Avenue Shopping District will...</i>

437
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,390
Huh.

438
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,470
It's a holiday, but students are passing through.

439
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,640
There're quite a few of them, actually.

440
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,110
Must be junior high students on their way home from club practice.

441
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,060
There are a lot of schools around here.

442
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,400
Junior highs, high schools, and universities too.

443
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,740
<i>C-Can you capitalize somehow on the fact that we're a shopping district?</i>

444
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,110
That's it!

445
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,570
Y-Yukihira-kun?

446
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:48,910
That's right!

447
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,580
I spent all this time thinking inside the box!

448
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,830
We don't need to fight them on <i>their</i> turf!

449
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,160
So we're going with A-5 beef, then!

450
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,380
Nah, we'll be doing chicken karaage.

451
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:57,930
Huh?

452
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,380
But you just said we won't fight them on their turf.

453
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,350
We won't.

454
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:05,440
We just have to think about doing
 what the other side can't.

455
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,720
Doing what only we can,
 because we're a shopping district.

456
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,890
We're going to come up with the best way for people to enjoy karaage.

457
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:19,060
We're going to set the stage for our victory.

458
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,220
My word is law.

459
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,330
That's the condition for my consulting services.

460
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,450
Fine. I accept.

461
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,670
Mozuya isn't the only one who wants my magic.

462
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,630
It's almost time.

463
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,960
Shut up. I know.

464
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,760
What's on the agenda today?

465
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,180
You didn't read the message?

466
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,250
It's the Autumn Selection.

467
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:17,100
We're going to start narrowing down
 which first-years will get to compete.

468
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,680
What a waste of time.

469
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,390
Why do we have to do that during break?

470
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,770
What choice do we have?

471
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,860
It's one of our important responsibilities...

472
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:32,200
as the Elite Ten of Tohtsuki!

473
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,990
End

474
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,990
End

475
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,790
Next time, we'll talk about karaage in a train station!

476
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:46,000
Mozuya, Mozuya, Mozuya!

477
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,620
The Karaage of Youth.

478
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,060
Have one!

479
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,140
Please continue your patronage!
