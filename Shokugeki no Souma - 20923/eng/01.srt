1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,720
Disgusting!

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,400
<i>They don't go together at all.</i>

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,870
<i>What a devastatingly poor pairing.</i>

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,450
<i>Squid tentacles and peanut butter...</i>

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,290
<i>I can't help but laugh.</i>

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,460
<i>It's so </i>disgusting<i>.</i>

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,880
Souma.

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,290
Your friend is here.

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:28,960
Okay!

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,880
Let's do this!

11
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,690
Enjoy.

12
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,940
Dig in!

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,900
Thank you!

14
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,620
Oh, the cooking battle's on!

15
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,230
So Mayumi's the judge today?

16
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,760
You think...

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,840
...today's the day he'll...

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,220
Shh! Mayu's making up her mind!

19
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,180
This one!

20
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,590
It's over!

21
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,150
The old man wins once again!

22
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,070
Souma.

23
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,030
You still need more training.

24
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,490
Looks like I've lost today.

25
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,950
Say that after you win at least once.

26
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,000
You're closing in on 500 losses, aren't you?

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,050
Huh?!

28
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,670
Don't get cocky! 
That was only the 489th time you've won!

29
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,040
So like I said, you're getting close.

30
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,670
Shut up, old man!

31
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,850
The owner's Chinese fried rice is seriously the best!

32
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,190
It's amazing we can eat food 
this good so close to home!

33
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,820
We're so lucky!

34
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,310
I can't get enough!

35
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,020
B-But yours was really good too, Yukihira-kun!

36
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,150
I've never had such delicious Chinese fried rice!

37
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,860
Thanks.

38
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,620
I have a new dish that I came up with earlier today.

39
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,100
Would you like some?

40
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,500
Really? I'd love to try it!

41
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,410
Grilled squid tentacles in a peanut butter dressing.

42
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,080
Huh?

43
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,040
Mayu!

44
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,790
Whoa, he's at it again!

45
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,340
This one's even crazier than last time!

46
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,840
Here, dig in. It's so outrageous that you'll be howling in laughter.

47
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,760
N-No...

48
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,230
No!

49
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,850
<i>The taste of the tentacles took 
a turn in the wrong direction.</i>

50
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,520
<i>It was as if my entire body was being violated.</i>

51
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,780
Well, that's what the girl said some time later.

52
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,450
Cooking is an endless wasteland.

53
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,750
A wasteland littered with countless flavors, both delicious and disgusting.

54
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,590
And I want to see what lies beyond that horizon.

55
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,930
Shut up, idiot! Keep your wanderlust to yourself!

56
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,600
Hang in there, Mayu! How are you feeling?

57
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,970
The squid... The squid is...

58
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,100
Yukihira is always so happy
to make people eat his mistakes.

59
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,770
If it weren't for that quirk, 
he'd be a decent chef.

60
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:41,820
But the dried sardines with strawberry jam combo
 I dreamed up was worse still, huh, Souma?

61
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,240
Oh, I remember that.

62
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,700
That was a nasty mess of epic proportions.

63
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,910
Right?

64
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,370
But the peanut butter tentacles are worse!

65
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,860
No way! Sardines with jam are worse!

66
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,250
Peanut butter tentacles are worse!

67
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,280
<i>Well, with a dad like that, 
I guess he </i>would<i> turn out that way.</i>

68
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,960
Mine was worse!

69
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,140
Here's your liver and garlic chives.

70
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,160
Could I get the pork and tofu set?

71
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,820
I'll have today's special.

72
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,370
Got it.

73
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,030
One pork and tofu, one special!

74
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,410
Got it.

75
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,910
Whew, I'm stuffed.

76
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:55,790
That was great.

77
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,600
Thanks for the meal.

78
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,420
Thanks for coming!

79
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,250
Thank you for coming!

80
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,260
Souma.

81
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,130
When you're done, kill the flame on the charcoal grill.

82
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,390
For that Chinese fried rice, I should've shaken the pan three more times.

83
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,840
<i>I'll be graduating from middle school soon.</i>

84
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,690
<i>Then I'll be able to spend more time on my cooking.</i>

85
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:29,200


86
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,070
<i>I want to surpass Dad as soon as I can!</i>

87
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,200
<i>Then I'll take over as chef of this restaurant!</i>

88
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,660
Welc—

89
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,410
Pardon us.

90
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,330
It looks like you're still open,

91
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,380
but please forgive us for barging in.

92
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,510
I'm an urban planner, Minegasaki.

93
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,680
What would you like?

94
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,500
Huh?

95
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,260
Today, we recommend the 
splendid alfonsino sashimi and...

96
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,350
No, I'm not here for that.

97
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:01,600
I'm following up on what we discussed the other day.

98
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,760
We'd love to bring this comfortable and luxurious urban apartment building,

99
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,970
designed in the "Garden Residence" style, to this town—

100
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,870
We get it.

101
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,950
You people are land sharks,

102
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,660
and you want us out of here.

103
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,410
We've heard all this before.

104
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,640
Go home.

105
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,160
We have no intention of shutting this place down.

106
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,290
Then...

107
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,520
I'll just leave my card here.

108
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,710
You can call me any time.

109
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,920
But, sir, with the economy as it is,

110
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,180
running a hole-in-the-wall like this will become increasingly difficult.

111
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,680
I hear many restaurants agonize every day
about managing their stock.

112
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,980
We don't have that problem.

113
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,390
Is that so?

114
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,810
Yukihira takes the responsibility...

115
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,270
of giving our customers what they want.

116
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,270
Oh, how wonderful!

117
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,490
You're everything the service industry should be!

118
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,030
But if you can't serve what your customers want,

119
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,600
how will you take responsibility?

120
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,660
If that day ever comes,

121
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,880
we'll close up shop gracefully and go out of business.

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,380
Can I hold you to that?

123
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,640
Yeah.

124
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,100
Then I'll see you again soon.

125
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,150
Dad! The salt! Throw the salt!

126
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,070
Nope. That'd be a waste of salt.

127
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,320
What do you wanna do now?

128
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,610
Hm, karaoke?

129
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,910
With what rules, then?

130
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,530
How about anime songs?

131
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,200
You say that every time.

132
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,200
Mayu!

133
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,160
Don't make fun of anime songs!

134
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,130
Hey, Dad?

135
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,050
<i>Yeah. You home yet?</i>

136
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,430
No, I picked up some stuff for breakfast.

137
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,100
What's up?

138
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,040
<i>I'm out taking care of some business.</i>

139
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,650
Yeah? That's unusual.

140
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,410
<i>I won't be home until tomorrow,</i>

141
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,250
<i>so you don't have to open the restaurant.</i>

142
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,190
Okay.

143
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,440
<i>Hey.</i>

144
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,820
<i>What do you plan to do after middle school?</i>

145
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,330
What else? I'll study cooking at the restaurant.

146
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,200
<i>I see.</i>

147
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,040
What was that about?

148
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,370
<i>And...</i>

149
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:31,840
<i>what's so important that he'd close
 the restaurant for a day?</i>

150
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,010
<i>My dad doesn't talk about himself much.</i>

151
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,470
<i>Now that I think about it, I know very little...</i>

152
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,640
<i>about my dad as a chef.</i>

153
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,770
<i>Huh?</i>

154
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,440
<i>The meat is ruined?</i>

155
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,910
<i>The fridge is completely...</i>

156
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,620
<i>A burglar? No, a burglar wouldn't do this.</i>

157
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,510
Oh, my!

158
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,260
The ambiance is so much more 
pleasant compared to yesterday.

159
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,220
Maybe it's because that ugly sign is covered up.

160
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,270
Ah, today I'm in the mood to eat some meat.

161
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:34,070
That marbled steak I always have in Roppongi is just the best!

162
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:39,320
The juice just fills up my mouth.

163
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,450
Hey, little boy,

164
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:48,960
give me the juiciest meat dish you can make.

165
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,880
Oh? Don't tell me you can't satisfy me.

166
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,420
Your customer is asking for meat.

167
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,170
Can't you serve it?

168
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,890
Silly boy, didn't you tell me yesterday...

169
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,390
that if you couldn't serve a customer, you'd go out of business?

170
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,430
Someone decided to give this joint a new coat of paint.

171
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,850
I don't think it's a coincidence.

172
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,440
It must be a sign that you should shut this place down.

173
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,240
A juicy meat dish?

174
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,570
Is that your order?

175
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,410
Swear that you'll never enter this restaurant again,

176
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,420
if I serve a meal that satisfies your palate.

177
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,680
The battle's on!

178
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:28,890
Wait.

179
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,400
Didn't I tell you to trash the fridge?

180
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,670
W-We did.

181
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,900
There isn't a single scrap of usable meat left.

182
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,230
I asked you for juicy meat!

183
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,820
What are you playing at?
 There's nothing you can use!

184
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,430
Impossible!

185
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,380
How did you...

186
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,680
...make such a perfect...

187
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,180
...pork roast?!

188
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,770
It's simple.

189
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,110
I wrapped some potatoes in...

190
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,820
the thick-cut bacon I bought for tomorrow's breakfast.

191
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,070
It's "Gotcha" Pork Roast!

192
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,610
Potatoes?

193
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,990
"Gotcha"?

194
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,030
Roast?

195
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,830
That's right. First, I steam the potatoes.

196
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,500
Huh? What's this atmosphere?

197
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,630
Are you making a fool of me?

198
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,550
I told you to serve me meat!

199
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,670
There's no room for negotiation anymore.

200
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,510
Give this restaurant to me!

201
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,720
Listen to me! Truly successful chefs

202
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:55,730
work in first class restaurants or luxury hotels 
like the ones I've promoted.

203
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,230
This is a failure!

204
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,770
If you ask me, this restaurant 
isn't even worthy of existing!

205
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,650
Yukihira

206
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,690
This one dish will tell you whether or not Yukihira...

207
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,160
is worthy of existing.

208
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,540
Dig in.

209
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,210
<i>With every bite,</i>

210
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,920
<i>the fragrant juice of the slow-roasted bacon...</i>

211
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,840
<i>pours into my mouth!</i>

212
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,390
You look like you're enjoying that.

213
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,940
This was devised at the restaurant you just ridiculed.

214
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,280
Should I tell you the secret of this flavor?

215
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,160
Once I've steamed the potatoes to a fluffy consistency,

216
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,330
I chop up fibrous mushrooms, 
which will soak up the fat.

217
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,670
Then I dice some sweet onions for sweetness and knead them all together.

218
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,980
After that, I wrap thick-cut bacon around it all...

219
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,340
and roast it slowly in the oven.

220
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,590
That makes the bacon crispy on the outside...

221
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,810
while the potatoes and mushrooms soak up all the savory flavor and fat from the pork.

222
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,520
And so...

223
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,440
a sensual new mouthfeel,

224
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,150
crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, is born!

225
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,830
A long time ago, while preparing potato salad for a customer,

226
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:25,540
I made a mistake while plating it, 
letting meat drippings soak into the potatoes.

227
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,260
That's where I got the idea for this dish.

228
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,630
From a mistake.

229
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,140
So what?

230
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,560
You can't call this a meat dish!

231
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,940
But... I can't...

232
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,020
stop eating it!

233
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,070
I want to taste more of this meat juice!

234
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,240
Wh-What are you doing?!

235
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,950
If you want any more of this, promise me...

236
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,410
that you'll never come after this restaurant again.

237
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,130
What? Who would promise that?

238
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,590
Oh, I see.

239
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,840
It's a shame, but you leave me with no choice.

240
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,470
I'll have to take this and...

241
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,010
Wait!

242
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,560
I promise! I promise, okay?!

243
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,440
What?

244
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:33,490
Let me... um...

245
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,950
have some more, please?

246
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:28,710
Meat juices!

247
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,890
Glad you liked it!

248
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,920
<i>No matter what happens,
 I won't let this restaurant go under.</i>

249
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,880
<i>Yukihira is my castle for perfecting my cooking!</i>

250
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:24,930
Dad...

251
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,220
Looks like something happened.

252
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,850
Nothing important.

253
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,790
Just a rude customer.

254
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,610
Souma.

255
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,240
For the next two or three years, I'm going to...

256
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,660
close the restaurant.

257
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,420
Yeah, I know, I'll have to apologize to our regulars.

258
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,170
Apologize to your son first!

259
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:01,050
An old friend of mine suggested we work together.

260
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,050
Wha—

261
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,760
I'll be living with them for a while,

262
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,680
so I won't be around.

263
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,440
But you can't just...

264
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,400
Hey, Dad!

265
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,820
As soon as I get my stuff together, I'm leaving.

266
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,610
Wait.

267
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,110
I'll be sending you some money to live on.

268
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,030
I said, wait!

269
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,030
I want to... stay at this restaurant and...

270
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,210
It's time for you to go, Souma.

271
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,130
Go figure out what you've got.

272
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,100
Cooking school?

273
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,560
Why do I have to go to a school like this now?

274
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,320
It's perfect timing, isn't it?

275
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,020
I'm closing the restaurant, and you can earn high school credits there.

276
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,110
Just go study there for three years.

277
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,200
Paying to learn how to cook is so stupid.

278
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,540
A culinary school is just gonna be like...

279
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:19,000
Okay, today I'll teach you a dish that you can make nice and easy.

280
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,750
Yes, sir!

281
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,170
Gah!

282
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,380
I failed the advancement test!

283
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,600
I'm done for. My life is over.

284
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,060
I beg you!

285
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,020
I'll donate ten million, no, twenty million!

286
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,230
Just rescind my son's expulsion!

287
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,190
What's going on?

288
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,700
<i>Oh, didn't I tell you?</i>

289
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,700
<i>That's Japan's top culinary academy,</i>

290
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:56,160
<i>with a graduation rate of less than 10%.</i>

291
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,670
<i>It's a super elite institution.</i>

292
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,590
How revolting!

293
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,050
What a terrible soup.

294
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,220
It tasted like I was standing
peacefully under a waterfall,

295
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,310
and then a jukebox came
 crashing down on me!

296
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,140
A jukebox?

297
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,560
That's hard to understand.

298
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:27,020
I-I'm sorry, Lady Erina!

299
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,570
Honestly, I can't even laugh at this.

300
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,450
Not in the least.

301
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:43,830
Next time on <i>Shokugeki no Souma</i>,

302
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,080
the second dish:

303
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,980
God Tongue.

304
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,010
Please enjoy.

305
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,500
Peanut butter tentacles...
