1
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:04,400
I object!

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:09,040
We should re-evaluate whether this student should be chosen for the Autumn Selection.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,240
His record hardly merits his inclusion in a time-honored gourmet festival.

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,840
Nakiri-kun.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,140
On matters concerning food,
 your judgment has been indisputable.

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,250
However, when it comes to Souma-kun,

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,170
your views border on the irrational.

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,250
Perhaps something happened between you two?

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,000
Something personal?

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,880
C-Certainly not.

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,300
I simply believe this man to be unworthy!

12
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,180
Isshiki-san,

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,850
perhaps <i>you</i> are biased in his favor because he's from your dorm.

14
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,270
Of course not!

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,270
Yukihira Souma...

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,200
He seems like an interesting guy.

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,230
I say we let him take part.

18
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,110
It's true that he has accomplished little of note at the academy.

19
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,990
He hasn't been here long.

20
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,110
<i>Nice to meet you!</i>

21
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,870
But at the camp, he made a last-minute comeback to serve 200 dishes.

22
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,620
He received commendations
 for the first day's task as well.

23
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,630
A maverick like him would surely

24
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,420
make the festival more entertaining, don't you think?

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,380
I don't get why you're so against the idea.

26
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,850
No further objections, I suppose?

27
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,810
Then let this be the final decision.

28
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,450
Hey, hurry up!

29
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,660
They finally posted the results!

30
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,700
Yeah!

31
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,170
I didn't make it!

32
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,470
So these are the Autumn Selection contestants.

33
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,550
Oh?

34
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,640
Heck yeah!

35
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,650
Wh-What do I do now?

36
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,060
Hey!

37
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,530
So all three of you were selected too?

38
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,030
Souma-kun!

39
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,530
Good job, guys.

40
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,370
It seems we'll get to face off

41
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,370
before we'll ever have a Cooking Battle, Yukihira!

42
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,290
Hey, Nikumi!

43
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,040
Looks like you made it in.

44
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,500
Y-Yeah.

45
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,960
What about you?

46
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,840
Yup!

47
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,880
Good luck to you too, Takumi!

48
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,090
D-Don't treat me like a sidekick!

49
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,840
Isami, quit laughing!

50
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,260
But of course.

51
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,770
Um... Oh, I'm on the list too.

52
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,480
As if you wouldn't be!

53
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,690
It'd be embarrassing if my close
 aide failed to be selected.

54
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,530
Failure is not an option during the prelims, got it?

55
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,490
Don't worry.

56
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,860
Even if I were to end up facing you,

57
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,410
I'm invested enough to still try to win.

58
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,290
Why are you upset?

59
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,160
What's with you?

60
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,540
It looks like you don't respect me very much!

61
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,920
I'm always trying to show you how much I respect you.

62
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,740
More!

63
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,250
I want you to show me more respect!

64
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,090
You should emulate Erina's secretary!

65
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,300
Oh, hey! You're Nakiri's cousin!

66
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,890
Well, well, if it isn't Yukihira Souma-kun.

67
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:47,930
How have you been?

68
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,680
Hey, why are all these famous
 people flocking to Yukihira?

69
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,350
When did he even meet them?

70
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,350
Oh, yeah!

71
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,480
I'd better tell Fumio-san about this!

72
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,440
I bet she'll be so happy that
 the "golden age" has returned!

73
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,450
Hello, everyone!

74
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,780
I have the honor of being your host for the Autumn Selection!

75
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,540
My name is Kawashima Urara!

76
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,920
Smile!

77
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,130
Urara-chan!

78
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,670
Glower...

79
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:25,380
My heartfelt congratulations to those of you who have been selected!

80
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,060
As I'm sure you're already aware
 from the announcement,

81
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,680
the sixty contestants have been
 split into Groups A and B.

82
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,440
Each group will undergo
 the preliminaries separately.

83
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,150
Only those who attain a high enough rank within each group will advance to the actual tournament!

84
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,820
Let's see.

85
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,700
I have a message from Eizan-senpai,
 a member of the Executive Committee.

86
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,620
"Many VIPs and heavyweights of the food industry will attend the preliminaries.

87
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,130
This is the perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your talents."

88
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,090
"However...

89
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,800
...should you have the misfortune of presenting an unworthy dish,

90
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,010
any hope of pursuing a career in the food industry will be forfeit."

91
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,600
"Well, best of luck preparing for it...

92
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,850
...over your summer break."

93
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,310
That's all, everyone!

94
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,150
We have no choice!

95
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,940
I'll make it into the tournament!

96
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,990
Congratulations on being selected.

97
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,030
It was only to be expected, given your talent.

98
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,530
Thank you.

99
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:35,290
As your aide, I will not disappoint you, Erina-sama.

100
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:41,460
And please rest assured that
 I will punish Yukihira Souma!

101
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,460
Oh, my deepest apologies! 
I shouldn't have mentioned him!

102
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,800
<i>You'd do well to flounder at
 the very bottom of the barrel.</i>

103
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,060
<i>I doubt you'll be chosen for the Selection.</i>

104
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,260
<i>Selection?</i>

105
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,730
<i>Like I said, there's no way someone
 like you would be chosen!</i>

106
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,400
<i>Don't get too ahead of yourself, Yukihira-kun.</i>

107
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,400
<i>Nakiri Erina stands far above you.</i>

108
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,360
Nakiri's not participating?

109
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,740
Right.

110
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,490
The Autumn Selection is overseen by the Tohtsuki Elite Ten every year,

111
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,240
so Erina will be on the other side of the table running things.

112
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,750
Oh, well. I suppose it'll be a while before I can face off with Erina.

113
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,670
<i>I was afraid of this.</i>

114
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,880
<i>Everyone's so talented that I feel out of place!</i>

115
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,630
Why'd that dropout get picked when we didn't?

116
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,640
I have higher scores than her in classes and labs.

117
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,890
It doesn't make any sense.

118
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,430
What's going on?

119
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,850
Shut up!

120
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,310
You're all so pathetic.

121
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,560
Listen up!

122
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,400
The selection isn't based solely on grades.

123
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,530
Candidates are assessed based on a range of factors,
 including their individuality and potential.

124
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,700
Anyone satisfied by mere grades
 would never be chosen.

125
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,290
Look at that deep footprint!

126
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,000
U-Um, thank you!

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,250
Um, who are...

128
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,880
I'm Houjou Miyoko.

129
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,300
You're Tadokoro Megumi, aren't you?

130
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,300
I'm <i>very</i> interested in you.

131
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,770
Shinomiya Kojirou was one of the Elite Ten.

132
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,020
I heard you had a Cooking Battle
 with him. Is that true?

133
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,770
And on top of that, I heard it was a draw.

134
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,280
Oh! But, um...

135
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,860
But I didn't officially get a draw!

136
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,570
No way!

137
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,990
You mean you won?

138
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,910
N-No, not at all! I mean—

139
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,580
What is it?! Speak up!

140
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,790
Well...

141
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,450
S-Souma-kun, he...

142
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,080
It was all th-thanks to him.

143
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,250
I wasn't any good by myself, so...

144
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,550
Yukihira Souma. You mean the transfer student?

145
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,680
What the hell? So it was only
 because you had help from a guy?

146
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,640
Sorry to waste your time.

147
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,310
I misjudged you.

148
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,260
Did you know, Yukihira-kun?

149
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:09,770
Most of the current Elite Ten have fought in the main tournament.

150
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:16,070
In other words, the next Elite Ten will emerge from those who survive the preliminaries.

151
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,500
Ah, Erina-sama...

152
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,750
She's as beautiful as always.

153
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:36,880
I want her noble eyes and words to despise me!

154
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,010
That bitch!

155
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,620
Oh, how I hate her!

156
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,480
I am more worthy of Erina-sama!

157
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,820
The groups should be getting
 announced right about now.

158
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,650
Yes.

159
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,150
Marui-kun.

160
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,570
You'll have to win this if you're going to have any chance at all.

161
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,370
I hope the day will come when Erina, you,

162
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,620
and I can all compete over the Elite Ten seats!

163
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,320
<i>In the middle of the room, </i><i>there's a scorch mark.</i>

164
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,940
<i>It used to be my room.</i>

165
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,060
<i>Until the next time you lose to me,</i>

166
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,940
<i>you'd better not lose to anyone else.</i>

167
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,440
<i>I'll crush you.</i>

168
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:42,070
I'm getting hyped up.

169
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,580
Well! What a beautiful morning!

170
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,580
It's the perfect way to start off summer break!

171
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,880
Hey!

172
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Look, everybody, look!

173
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,880
It's here!

174
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,380
It's from the Autumn Selection office!

175
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,140
C'mon, let's open it.

176
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,100
Curry...

177
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,640
dish?

178
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,230
So we just have to make curry rice?

179
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:20,070
It says "dish," so it doesn't <i>have</i> to be curry rice.

180
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:25,370
I guess it can be any dish
 that uses curry in some form.

181
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,620
Right, Isshiki-senpai?

182
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,410
Well, I wonder.

183
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,000
Aw, you're avoiding the question!

184
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,630
<i>Curry....</i>

185
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:36,670
<i>It's such a broad theme that
 I don't know where to begin.</i>

186
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,880
Sakaki-kun, you make good tea.

187
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,380
May I have seconds?

188
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,380
Hm?

189
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:43,340
<i>What was Polar Star Dormitory like back then?</i>

190
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,010
<i>It was fun.</i>

191
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,350
<i>Everyone worked on perfecting
 their craft however they could.</i>

192
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,850
<i>Oh, there was one student who always made curry.</i>

193
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,940
<i>Her name was Shiomi.</i>

194
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,440
<i>I think she became an instructor at Tohtsuki.</i>

195
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,150
<i>If you ever meet her, mention my name.</i>

196
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,950
<i>I looked after her a lot back then.</i>

197
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,240
<i>I think she'll look after you.</i>

198
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,450
That's what my dad told me.

199
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,960
I guess that's the place up ahead.

200
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,410
Huh?

201
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,710
It's more run-down than I expected.

202
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,880
Maybe she's scary, like Chappelle-sensei.

203
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,630
Hello!

204
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,090
Shiomi, Shiomi...

205
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,050
Excuse me!

206
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,100
Huh?

207
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,010
No one's here?

208
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:31,770
Holy crap!

209
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,100
Um...

210
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,400
A visitor?!

211
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,110
Um, um...

212
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,900
Sorry!

213
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
I'll put on some tea!

214
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,360
<i>She's so short.</i>

215
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,150
Oh, sorry for being so inconsiderate!

216
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,400
<i>Is she in junior high?</i>

217
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,780
I'm sorry, please don't mind us!

218
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,120
Sorry, I'm always spacing out!

219
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,710
I'm sorry for barging in like this!

220
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,000
Oh, don't worry about it!

221
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,950
I'm sorry.

222
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,720
Sorry.

223
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,580
I'm sorry.

224
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,870
<i>They're apologizing for making 
the other one apologize.</i>

225
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,120
Sorry.

226
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,750
I'm sorry.

227
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,500
Sorry.

228
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,120
I'm so sorry.

229
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,870
Sorry.

230
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,380
So, uh, is the instructor in charge of this lab around?

231
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,340
If you could tell her that Saiba
 Jouichirou's son came by to see—

232
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,060
You're Saiba Jouichirou's son?

233
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,690
Please get the hell out!

234
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:18,360
What?

235
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,150
Um, he's unconscious right now,
 so that might be difficult.

236
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:27,700
I don't even want to <i>think</i> about Saiba-senpai!

237
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,660
Hey, Jun. I got you what you wanted—

238
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh, sorry for the intrusion!

239
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,320
Hey, c'mon!

240
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,750
Are you even trying?

241
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,880
Find the best angle!

242
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,780
But you're beautiful from every angle.

243
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,010
You don't have to tell <i>me</i> that!

244
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,300
Okay.

245
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,470
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

246
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,720
<i>M-My name is Shiomi Jun.</i>

247
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,390
<i>Welcome to Polar Star Dormitory.</i>

248
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:58,770
<i>I heard you passed Fumio-san's
 entrance test on your first try.</i>

249
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,150
<i>You sound quite promising.</i>

250
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,960
<i>Th-Thank you!</i>

251
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,610
<i>Mornin'!</i>

252
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,050
<i>Jouichirou, go get dressed.</i>

253
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,780
<i>Huh? Fresh meat?</i>

254
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,950
<i>Okay, it's time for a welcome.</i>

255
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,560
<i>Want to try a new recipe of mine?</i>

256
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,330
<i>S-Sure, I'd love to!</i>

257
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,670
And so it came to pass that, as the most junior resident of Polar Star Dormitory,

258
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:30,840
I was subjected to Saiba-senpai's experiments at every turn and tortured like you wouldn't believe.

259
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,310
No!

260
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,190
That was how I became scarred for life.

261
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,270
Hey, you haven't changed one bit!

262
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:45,760
Well, that's perhaps because I've always been partial to spices.

263
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,560
Many spices are good for your looks.

264
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,320
There's no way that's the whole story!

265
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:55,440
Man, my dad really treated
 his underclassmen poorly,

266
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,080
Stare...

267
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,080
didn't he, Tadokoro?

268
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,590
Um, so, the two of us are from Polar Star,

269
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,070
and we wanted to learn more about curry.

270
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,350
That's right.

271
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,400
The Autumn Selection—

272
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,340
I don't mind teaching the girl what I know.

273
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:17,060
But I'll never speak with Saiba-senpai or any of his family members.

274
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,620
Sorry. As our guests, she should be
 treating you two with more respect.

275
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:26,060
I'm Hayama. I'm a first-year in high school, just like you guys.

276
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,780
I'm an assistant here.

277
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,280
Really?

278
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,650
I thought you could only join a lab
 once you're a second-year.

279
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:37,000
Well, it's because this woman needs me.

280
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,900
She's incapable of anything besides fiddling around with spices.

281
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,930
Isn't that so, Jun?

282
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,130
Don't call me Jun!

283
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,330
Call me Professor Shiomi!

284
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,700
Hayama-kun, you're my assistant!

285
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,160
You should show me some respect—

286
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,550
Jun, you were supposed to water the plants today.

287
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,930
You forgot.

288
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,300
I did it in your stead.

289
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,530
Yes, sorry.

290
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,550
You forgot last week too,

291
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,920
and the spice plants almost died.

292
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,110
Yes. That was my fault.

293
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,800
And who took care of the guests
 that you ignored entirely last month?

294
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,130
It was you, Hayama-kun.

295
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,030
<i>She's getting even tinier.</i>

296
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,240
Look, Souma-kun.

297
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:16,200
Yeah, there are a ton of spices.

298
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,660
Oh, this smells a lot like curry!

299
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,120
It's a spice called kadi patta.

300
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,620
It also goes by the name "curry leaf."

301
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,750
Huh?

302
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,890
Is this fresh?

303
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,490
You know this, Tadokoro?

304
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,090
Yeah.

305
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,910
The tree is very susceptible to cold weather.

306
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,810
It will die in the winter.

307
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,750
So in Japan, you usually only see dried curry leaf.

308
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,040
It's very difficult to get fresh leaves.

309
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,060
It's one of Jun's research projects.

310
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:51,400
She's devised a way to reliably
 cultivate tropical spices in Japan.

311
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,360
Aside from pioneering new freezing
 techniques for long-term storage,

312
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,830
she's managed to extract many
 never-before-seen flavor compounds.

313
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,260
Wow, you're more accomplished
 than you look, Sensei!

314
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,750
Y-Your flattery doesn't make me happy.

315
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,040
Still, yes.

316
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,460
That shows how much potential 
is locked inside the spices.

317
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,800
To start with, spices speak to these three factors:

318
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,160
fragrance, spiciness, and color.

319
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,510
Blending spices creates synergy.

320
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,850
The more spices you blend,
 the less their own attributes stick out.

321
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,520
But if you are not mindful in selecting your spices,

322
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,100
blending may combine to produce off-flavors.

323
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,900
Twenty different spices is the limit!

324
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,720
In addition, fat is indispensable for making the most of spices!

325
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,740
By heating spices in oil,
 you can amplify their fragrance.

326
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,740
What, we're being subjected
 to a full-on lecture now?

327
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:39,700
The flavor is best enhanced
 through emulsification!

328
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,700
Ugh, she'll be stuck like this for a while.

329
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,300
Hey, maybe it'll be faster for you
 to learn by experiencing it firsthand.

330
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,210
Come have a taste.

331
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,420
I'll show you how deep the spice world goes.

332
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,880
Here's the first dish.

333
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,340
Kozhi vartha curry.

334
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,300
It's a traditional south Indian dish.

335
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:58,570
I used the curry leaf you saw earlier to flavor it.

336
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,600
Wow, it looks really good!

337
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,290
<i>What's this?</i>

338
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:08,620
<i>First, the strong fragrance of
 the curry leaf pierces your nose.</i>

339
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,610
<i>Then the spicy umami of chili peppers and onions follow, filling your mouth!</i>

340
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,570
That's the power of fresh curry leaf.

341
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,450
It's ten times as potent
 as the dried version.

342
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,490
All right.

343
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,910
Here's the next dish.

344
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,810
Goan fish curry, which uses whitefish such as marlin and salmon.

345
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,420
Huh?

346
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,690
Two servings of the same curry?

347
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,720
They both use the same ingredients and spices.

348
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,680
Compare how they taste.

349
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,180
The second one I ate... tastes much better?

350
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:47,890
That's right.

351
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,240
For the second dish,

352
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,190
I toasted red peppers and
 coriander in a frying pan.

353
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,940
Dry-roasting is the key to that difference.

354
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,010
What?

355
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,640
Just doing that changed the dish this much?

356
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,700
The fragrance in this one
 is worlds above the other!

357
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,200
<i>I understand what she was talking about now.</i>

358
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,870
<i>All the ingredients' flavors are grounded
 and unified by the dry-roasted spices!</i>

359
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,500
Here's the last one.

360
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,880
It looks just like the kozhi vartha curry we first tried.

361
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,960
Right, but it's totally different.

362
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,790
The curry leaf flavor is stronger
 in this one, several times over!

363
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,480
The burst of spiciness in your mouth
 is much stronger in this one too!

364
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,310
The flavor is much more distinct!

365
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,260
Note that I haven't added any
 new ingredients for this curry.

366
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,450
I simply simmered the ingredients
 in water instead of stock.

367
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,910
Water?!

368
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,520
I applied what Jun said earlier.

369
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:51,050
The more flavors you blend together,
 the less pronounced each flavor becomes.

370
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,260
This is the other side of the same coin.

371
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,920
By <i>removing</i> the flavor of the stock,

372
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,300
I magnified the flavor of 
the spices in this curry.

373
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:04,000
<i>But that usually means 
the taste will lack depth.</i>

374
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,560
<i>And yet, this fragrance is really assertive.</i>

375
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,860
<i>It's piercing me!</i>

376
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,560
<i>I wouldn't have imagined a dish
 could undergo such a dramatic change</i>

377
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,270
<i>just by handling the spices a little differently!</i>

378
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:23,450
<i>He didn't look into the pot
 even once while cooking.</i>

379
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,410
The fennel's fragrance is starting to come through.

380
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,410
Five seconds until the fennel's been heated through.

381
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,370
Forty seconds until the coconut paste's flavors are melded with the rest.

382
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,650
<i>He monitored what he was cooking
 just through the fragrance</i>

383
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,550
<i>of the ingredients and spices
 wafting up from the pot!</i>

384
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,220
I told you.

385
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,510
She needs me.

386
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,100
I transform her principles into actual cooking.

387
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,010
Huh?

388
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,260
Everyone's gone!

389
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,760
That's the role I play here.

390
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,660
A scientist who generates theory,

391
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,310
and a chef who puts it into practice!

392
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,520
I must admit, I laughed when I saw what the preliminaries' topic was.

393
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,530
Who knew it'd be a curry dish?

394
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,990
You're in the Autumn Selection too?

395
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,820
And in the same group as you, Yukihira Souma.

396
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,640
Huh?

397
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,980
Did I tell you my name earlier?

398
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,120
Come now, <i>everyone</i> knows your name.

399
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,560
Or at the very least, any first-year 
who attended the opening ceremony.

400
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,510
Your cooking's quite interesting.

401
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,210
Even when faced with all kinds of obstacles,
 you use inspiration to overcome them.

402
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,680
But that's not enough to climb
 to the top of Tohtsuki.

403
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:31,180
There's something that reaches the diner long before flavor and appearance.

404
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,640
And it lingers on long after
 the diner chews and swallows.

405
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,100
That's fragrance.

406
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,810
The one who dominates the field of cooking
 is the one who dominates its fragrance.

407
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:43,960
In other words, the one who'll
 take the top spot at Tohtsuki...

408
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,700
is me, Hayama Akira!

409
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,620
Well, thanks for the food.

410
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,360
Your curry was seriously good.

411
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,960
I'll repay you for that next time.

412
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,750
Next time?

413
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:59,020
I'll let you taste curry
 that's even better than yours...

414
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,000
at the preliminaries.

415
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:05,260
You think you can defeat <i>me</i> at curry?

416
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,260
You still don't get it after eating my curry?

417
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,990
Oh, I get it all right.

418
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,010
It was scary.

419
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,440
Huh?

420
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,490
Here's a guy who can make something I can't.

421
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,980
Of course I'm super envious.

422
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,110
Thanks for teaching me a lot!

423
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,280
I'll see you again at the prelims—

424
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,900
Hey!

425
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,740
I was still in the middle of my lecture!

426
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,160
The doorknob stabbed me in the gut.

427
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,580
I'm so sorry!

428
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,660
Yukihira Souma.

429
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:39,070
Facing curry means facing the spice head-on.

430
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,830
You have to face the fragrance.

431
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,630
My sense of smell is unparalleled.

432
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,840
You don't have a snowball's
 chance in hell of beating me.

433
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,410
Oh, sorry, I spaced out!

434
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,140
Next time on <i>Shokugeki no Souma</i>,

435
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,070
the twentieth dish:

436
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,910
The Dragon Lies Down 
and Ascends the Skies.

437
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,790
Oh, I'm sorry. What am I supposed to say?

438
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,910
Um, um, um...

439
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,440
Summer break!

440
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,120
S-Summer break!

441
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,200
Summer break...
