1
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,070
<i>It's heavenly!</i>

2
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,910
<i>This dish makes the most of
the seasonal ingredients of spring.</i>

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,370
<i>How could he put together such a delicate dish in so little time?</i>

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,380
<i>He's head and shoulders above all the other students in this dorm!</i>

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,130
Allow me to re-introduce myself.

6
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,130
I am one of the Tohtsuki Elite Ten:

7
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,680
the seventh seat,

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,680
Isshiki Satoshi.

9
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,900
You're one of the Elite Ten?

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,400
Now...

11
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,110
I'd like to try <i>your</i> cooking, Souma-kun.

12
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,530
What sort of dish will you make?

13
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:05,120
Show me the story you'll create on your plate.

14
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,720
<i>I'm beginning to understand
 why Dad sent me here.</i>

15
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,010
Hang onto your seat!

16
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,700
<i>Isshiki-senpai's dish:</i>

17
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,330
<i>peppered mackerel dressed
with a spring cabbage purée.</i>

18
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,540
Does your family run a traditional
Japanese restaurant, by any chance?

19
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,710
What gave you that idea?

20
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,130
Spanish mackerel grilled with Sichuan pepper is a common Japanese dish,

21
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,760
but not just any establishment could produce such a fine example.

22
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,100
<i>The mackerel is grilled to delicate perfection.</i>

23
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,440
<i>The accompanying purée of
spring cabbage surprised me.</i>

24
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:38,120
<i>But its mild, smooth sweetness is
 a perfect complement to the mackerel.</i>

25
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,950
<i>Spring is the season for Spanish mackerel,</i>

26
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,570
<i>while the spring cabbage brings
 out the mackerel's flavor.</i>

27
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,990
<i>It's so festive,</i>

28
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,370
<i>it's as if I'm basking in spring sunshine.</i>

29
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,610
Spanish mackerel...

30
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,630
All right!

31
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,250
I'll base it on a dish from Yukihira's secret menu, item number 20.

32
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,880
Yukihira's?

33
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,340
It's the name of my family's diner.

34
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,800
Using the same ingredients as you did,

35
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,310
I'll make a variation on
 one of our popular dishes.

36
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,970
It'll be on the same theme of spring.

37
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,700
Did I pass out?

38
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,070
Oops! I drank too much rice juice.

39
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,200
Huh?

40
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,370
Yukihira's cooking right now?

41
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,790
Is he still hungry?

42
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,160
They're having a cook-off.

43
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,090
Whoa, you were awake?

44
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,130
Wait!

45
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,330
A cook-off between those two?!

46
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,340
What happened?

47
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,170
No idea.

48
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,970
But it was Isshiki-senpai's idea.

49
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,650
Are we going to turn a blind eye to Senpai's attire?

50
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,690
We shouldn't interfere in a cook-off.

51
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,770
I guess.

52
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,360
All done!

53
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,990
Yukihira's secret menu item number 20, revised!

54
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,960
Tea over a mackerel rice ball!

55
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,210
Since I used mackerel
 instead of the usual salmon,

56
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,290
I had to tweak the dish
 to account for that change.

57
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,090
There's enough for everyone,
 so you can all dig in!

58
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,760
Wow, thanks.

59
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,380
What'd you pour over the rice?

60
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,050
It's salted kelp tea.

61
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,760
Its mild savoriness and depth of flavor are a perfect way to wrap up our feast.

62
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,270
Aw, getting served something like this makes me hungry all over again!

63
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,270
Indeed.

64
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,230
<i>This is all too pedestrian.</i>

65
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,310
<i>It practically screams diner food for the masses.</i>

66
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,490
<i>But perhaps...</i>

67
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,450
All right, then!

68
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,450
I'm gonna dig in!

69
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,580
Thanks for the food!

70
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,040
Delicious!

71
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,550
The mackerel is really juicy,

72
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,920
and the skin's crispy texture is superb!

73
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,550
The umami gushes out with every bite.

74
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,510
You can't get this kind of mouthfeel by grilling the fish.

75
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,390
How did he...

76
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,890
Poêlé.

77
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,730
This mackerel was cooked using the poêlé method.

78
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,230
Po...

79
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,690
...ê...

80
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,190
...lé?

81
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,270
Wait, why are <i>you</i> acting all surprised?

82
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,650
I'm not, I just don't know what this poêlé thing is.

83
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,610
What?!

84
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,910
Poêlé is a cooking method in French cuisine.

85
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,320
It's similar to pan-frying.

86
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:37,790
You pour olive oil and the like over the ingredients in order to ensure even browning.

87
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,280
Tell me, Souma-kun.

88
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,750
How did you come to know this method of cooking?

89
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,960
I learned it from my dad.

90
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,890
He said it's the best way to make crispy fish.

91
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,180
You can eat it all crunchy with rice...

92
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,390
or enjoy a different texture altogether
 by softening it a little in salted kelp tea.

93
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,190
And how did your father learn to cook French cuisine?

94
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,230
Oh, I'm not really sure.

95
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,700
I think he went around cooking in a lot of different countries.

96
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,950
I see.

97
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,910
<i>I never imagined he'd use a French technique to prepare a rice ball.</i>

98
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:20,370
<i>His cooking isn't bound by culinary
traditions or genres. How liberated!</i>

99
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,590
<i>The poêlé method is well suited
to meats with a thick skin.</i>

100
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,840
<i>Spanish mackerel is a perfect replacement for salmon.</i>

101
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:33,010
<i>Souma-kun realized its potential
in an instant and changed the dish.</i>

102
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,520
<i>The radiant rice is like pristine white snow.</i>

103
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:46,010
<i>And the Spanish mackerel bursts forth,</i>

104
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,360
<i>as if to symbolize the vitality of spring itself.</i>

105
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,820
<i>In this dish he has captured
the very moment that spring begins.</i>

106
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,720
<i>S...</i>

107
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,460
<i>S...</i>

108
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,210
<i>Sprouting!</i>

109
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,040
Glad you liked it!

110
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,670
How beautiful.

111
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,800
It was a beautiful thaw, Souma-kun.

112
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,740
Yours was, too, Senpai.

113
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,310
I could feel a refreshing spring breeze.

114
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,310
Thank you for this match.

115
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,400
<i>Huh?</i>

116
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,970
<i>What the hell's going on?</i>

117
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,410
Marui?

118
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,410
Marui.

119
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,250
Marui!

120
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,880
He's out cold.

121
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,710
Yeah.

122
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:35,670
Okay!

123
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,760
Dismissed!

124
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,100
Next time we'll be sure to
clean up before leaving, Marui.

125
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,760
Yeah, next time.

126
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,100
We swear.

127
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,940
Still, I wonder why Isshiki-senpai challenged Souma-kun to a cook-off.

128
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,400
Who knows? He's temperamental.

129
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,360
He's a weirdo. You shouldn't waste time on wondering what he might be thinking.

130
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,110
I'm tired.

131
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,080
Well, g'night, Megumi.

132
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,000
Good night.

133
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,960
Souma-kun, with this welcome party, 
you're now officially a member of Polar Star.

134
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,220
If you have any questions,

135
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,800
feel free to ask me.

136
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,970
Okay.

137
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,930
How do I get into the Elite Ten?

138
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,900
That's right.

139
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,360
You're gunning for the top spot 
in this academy, aren't you?

140
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,190
Is there a specific reason 
why you're so determined?

141
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:41,240
Well, I'm kind of in the middle 
of a fight with my dad.

142
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,700
I'll have to pull off something that major if I'm going to gain his respect.

143
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,620
Our match just now was a draw.

144
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,710
If I beat you,

145
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,250
will that make me the seventh best at Tohtsuki?

146
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,590
How wonderful!

147
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,140
I admire your ambition, Souma-kun!

148
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,820
O-Okay.

149
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,430
I'm super impressed by you right now!

150
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:11,400
It's how students who live at Polar Star <i>should</i> be!

151
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,400
R-Right.

152
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,090
But!

153
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,320
I'm going to call it a night.

154
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,190
It's getting late.

155
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,650
Let's get some rest, Souma-kun.

156
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,160
Well, I g-guess.

157
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,670
<i>You said you'd become number one at Tohtsuki.</i>

158
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:29,330
<i>Soon you'll realize just how heavy those words can be.</i>

159
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,420
<i>Uh, I'm Yukihira Souma.</i>

160
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,290
<i>To be honest,</i>

161
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,550
<i>this academy's just a stepping stone to me.</i>

162
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,300
<i>The number one spot is mine!</i>

163
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,760
<i>You'll come to understand</i>

164
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,180
<i>that at this academy,
 cooking is literally everything.</i>

165
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,620
<i>The main ingredient will be eggs.</i>

166
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,040
<i>Make one dish.</i>

167
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,500
<i>Only those whose creations impress my palate will be allowed to transfer into this academy.</i>

168
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,210
<i>Hand over the dish!</i>

169
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,800
<i>Disgusting!</i>

170
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,550
<i>I'll say one thing!</i>

171
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,510
<i>I haven't accepted you.</i>

172
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,550
<i>Neither you nor your cooking.</i>

173
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,810
<i>The number one spot is yours?</i>

174
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,810
<i>Don't make me laugh.</i>

175
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:35,730
<i>Every student here has been studying
cutting-edge gastronomy for all of junior high!</i>

176
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,190
<i>An underdog transfer student like you...</i>

177
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,650
<i>doesn't stand a chance against them!</i>

178
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,380
It's going to ferment!

179
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,970
Oh, Usako...

180
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,470
Heavy!

181
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,480
Morning, everyone.

182
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,780
They trashed my room yet again!

183
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,070
I'll be sure to tell them off
even more than I usually do!

184
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,830
'Sup.

185
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,290
Mornin'.

186
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,660
What is it?

187
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,960
What's wrong?

188
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,590
I had to table this last night,

189
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,590
but now it's time to put the Elite Ten's
seventh seat on the line!

190
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,470
It's time for a cook-off, Isshiki-senpai!

191
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,820
Huh?

192
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,000
Food! Food!

193
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,570
I'm starving.

194
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,030
Where's breakfast, Fumio-san?

195
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,660
Shut your traps!

196
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,280
Sit your butts down and wait!

197
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,330
Sorry, Souma-kun.

198
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,410
I never explained it to you.

199
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,660
Huh?

200
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,960
About how challenges work at Tohtsuki Academy.

201
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,050
Erina-sama!

202
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,340
Good luck!

203
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,970
Do your best!

204
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,890
Prepare yourself!

205
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,860
Our Chanko Hot Pot Research Society
has existed since the founding of this academy.

206
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,700
It has a long and glorious history.

207
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:54,580
What do you propose to build after razing our club room, Nakiri-kun?

208
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,830
A kitchen wing for my personal use.

209
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,330
The fifth wing has become cramped, so a sixth—

210
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,080
Unacceptable!

211
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,670
That building is chock full of not only history

212
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,340
but also the passion our predecessors
 put into their food!

213
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,010
You seek to trample that into the mud?

214
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,760
How dare you call yourself a chef?!

215
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,220
Yeah!

216
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,720
Don't let this atrocity happen!

217
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,240
Erina-sama.

218
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,310
This so-called passion you speak of...

219
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:24,820
Is it in your copies of your predecessors' recipes, or the squandering of your budget?

220
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,440
Over the past few years,
your group has accomplished little.

221
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,570
A research society that only sings the praises of their past glories

222
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,950
is of no value to Tohtsuki.

223
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,660
You abuse your power.

224
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,750
I can no longer turn a blind eye!

225
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,580
If I win, I demand that you leave the Elite Ten!

226
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,590
Come and face me, Nakiri Erina!

227
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,090
Then if I win, I will proceed with the construction as planned.

228
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:54,470
I accept your challenge, Goudabayashi-senpai.

229
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:01,990
There is an established policy to settle disputes among students at this academy.

230
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,110
There are several rules.

231
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:10,350
Because you wish to challenge me for my seventh seat,

232
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:14,160
you must wager something of equal value.

233
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,200
Something of equal value?

234
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,540
If we're talking about the seventh seat...

235
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,120
Not even your expulsion would be enough.

236
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,680
What?

237
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,470
Seriously?!

238
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:27,170
Indeed, a spot in the Elite Ten
is worth more than <i>that</i>.

239
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,170
After all, they are the highest decision-making body in the entire academy.

240
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:36,680
Not even instructors can oppose
 what the Elite Ten Council has decided.

241
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:42,310
In the past, this dorm used to produce several Elite Ten members every year.

242
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,480
It was the golden age of Polar Star.

243
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,810
In comparison, you lot are pathetic!

244
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,150
Not that talk again, Fumio-san.

245
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:56,200
Anyway, we could still go through with it if I chose to accept your wager,

246
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,830
but I don't want you to leave the academy.

247
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,450
So in conclusion, there can be no cook-off.

248
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,920
Seriously?

249
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,420
I even woke up at five today
 to get myself revved up.

250
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,050
I can't believe you're going for the seventh seat.

251
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,630
You're too reckless.

252
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,510
I think he's just stupid.

253
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,970
Besides, you can't just do whatever you want.

254
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,100
There are three things you need
 for an official cook-off.

255
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,490
First, official certification that you've made a formal challenge.

256
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,020
Second, an odd number of judges.

257
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,480
Third, an agreement between the contestants about the conditions of the challenge.

258
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,490
All must be met for the formal challenge to be valid.

259
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,700
I see.

260
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,200
Sounds like a huge pain.

261
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,490
But on the other hand,

262
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,620
if you satisfy those three requirements,

263
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,750
you can challenge anyone in the academy.

264
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,290
"All who oppose you...

265
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,540
shall be struck down through your cooking."

266
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,550
Tohtsuki's traditional cooking duel is called...

267
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,880
Cooking Battle.

268
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,430
The judges have cast their votes!

269
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,390
The winner of this Cooking Battle...

270
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,020
is Nakiri Erina!

271
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,310
I-Impossible.

272
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,810
It was unanimous.

273
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,780
But our Chanko Society...

274
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:19,240
Just how did my lobster fall short?!

275
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,380
There were 27 shortcomings in your dish.

276
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,390
First, the lobster.

277
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,890
You blanched it two seconds too long.

278
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:30,940
Second, the oysters produced a slight
off-flavor that tainted your entire hot pot.

279
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,000
Stop!

280
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,360
As for your vegetables...

281
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,310
Stop!

282
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,820
How was <i>your</i> cooking?!

283
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,610
How could it be any better than mine when I spent days perfecting it?!

284
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,200
Ready!

285
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,540
How is it, Senpai?

286
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,790
How is my <i>raviole de langoustine</i>?

287
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:59,710
<i>The steamed ravioli are light and bursting with the flavor of succulent freshwater prawns.</i>

288
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,680
<i>This supple elasticity...</i>

289
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,690
<i>It's reminiscent of being overwhelmed
 by the strength of a Grand Champion.</i>

290
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,860
<i>Her cooking's flavor is of an entirely different league!</i>

291
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,390
<i>It's heavenly!</i>

292
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,540
It's me.

293
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,200
Yes.

294
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,950
Please begin.

295
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:32,960
What are you—

296
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,460
N-No!

297
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,090
Please stop!

298
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,380
<i>Cruel and diabolical...</i>

299
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,090
<i>This...</i>

300
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,890
<i>This is...</i>

301
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,520
<i>This is what it means to carry the blood of the Demon Lord of Food!</i>

302
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,980
Good day.

303
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,950
"Cooking Battle," huh?

304
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:08,840
Man, and here I wanted to challenge Nakiri too.

305
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,790
Th-There's no way you could ever win!

306
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,750
I'm looking forward to your future.

307
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,090
You're sure to rack up a good cook-off record.

308
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,260
After all, you scored a draw against me.

309
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,050
Me, the seventh seat.

310
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,640
Wouldn't you agree, Ibusaki-kun?

311
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,260
Yeah, right.

312
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,720
I know you were pulling your punches.

313
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,810
That wasn't even your specialty.

314
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:39,020
You were playing it way too safe with that dish.

315
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,030
I don't know what you're talking about.

316
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:45,070
I believe I gave it my very best effort.

317
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,200
Heh.

318
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,160
How devious, Senpai.

319
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,120
<i>Souma-kun.</i>

320
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:54,420
<i>When I ate your cooking, I realized</i>

321
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,990
<i>that you're the kind of rookie who will cause</i>

322
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,630
<i>a whole new era of cooking battles
to bloom at this academy.</i>

323
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,850
That was most impressive, Erina-sama.

324
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,690
Defeating an opponent like him
is hardly praiseworthy.

325
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,360
He was far below my expectations.

326
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,620
Anyone who falls short of perfection has no place at Tohtsuki.

327
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,700
Show me the list of our next targets.

328
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,370
What?

329
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,370
Um, yes.

330
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,950
Here it is.

331
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,760
Erina-sama.

332
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,670
May I take on the next target?

333
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,130
I do not believe it necessary for you to personally deal with trash.

334
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,720
Please allow me the honor.

335
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,160
You're right.

336
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,210
That may be interesting.

337
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:22,230
However, I'm sure you understand the consequences if you fail.

338
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,190
I am called the Meat Master.

339
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:32,990
I will secure a perfect victory worthy of that name.

340
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,870
Next time on <i>Shokugeki no Souma</i>...

341
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,430
Oh, it's already the sixth dish:

342
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,000
The Meat Invader.

343
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,010
Wonderful!

344
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,510
Do you want it?

345
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,260
I do.
