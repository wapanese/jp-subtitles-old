1
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,580
Now then,

2
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,380
let us begin the final program of this camp.

3
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,050
You will be enjoying a full course meal prepared by the alumni.

4
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,550
All right!

5
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,480
All students, please gather your belongings

6
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,510
and prepare to board your designated bus.

7
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,130
Please return your room keys to the front desk.

8
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,890
Please check your surroundings to avoid leaving anything behind.

9
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,850
Oh, man!

10
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,350
We're done. We're finally done!

11
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,980
Everyone in Polar Star made it.

12
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,730
Yup.

13
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,230
Yeah.

14
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,560
It all passed by in a flash.

15
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,020
It was pretty challenging, though!

16
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,820
No kidding!

17
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:03,160
You didn't all need to barge into
 my room on the last night!

18
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,740
Didn't you enjoy yourself
 the last time we came over?

19
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,290
Yeah, last night too.

20
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,790
<i>C'mon, draw the old maid!</i>

21
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,420
Let's finish the game back at the dorm!

22
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:13,960
What?!

23
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,460
Maybe Isshiki-senpai can join in.

24
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,630
We can play Presidents and Assholes too.

25
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,550
Shinomiya-senpai!

26
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,100
So the two of you survived.

27
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,010
Yeah, we managed to get by somehow.

28
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,480
A suitcase?

29
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,310
Are you going back to France already?

30
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,390
Yes.

31
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,690
I can't keep my restaurant closed for too long.

32
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,940
Besides, I've decided what my goal is going to be.

33
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,450
I'm going to make SHINO'S the number one
three-star restaurant in all of Paris.

34
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,830
There's so much more I want to do.

35
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,500
Getting the Pluspol award was just the beginning.

36
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,000
A three salt plum restaurant?

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,290
Wow!

38
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:00,340
No Japanese chef in France has ever received three Michelin stars!

39
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,430
I don't suppose—

40
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,130
Stop right there!

41
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,840
You're not going to steal a march
 on us, Shinomiya-senpai!

42
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,680
I have <i>no</i> idea what you're talking about.

43
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,640
Yukihira Souma,

44
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,480
are you interested in Italian cuisine, by any chance?

45
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,020
Huh?

46
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,720
Tadokoro-kun, your talent would flourish at a sushi restaurant—

47
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,610
No way!

48
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,760
To ensure Megumi-chan's safety, I'd better take her with me!

49
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,190
Uh, what?!

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,490
I see you two have already been approached.

51
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,250
Ch-Chef Doujima, wh-what's going on?

52
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,040
The chefs have been sizing you up.

53
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,960
Sizing us up?

54
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,960
This camp also serves as an opportunity for chefs to offer students a position after graduation.

55
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,460
In order to come here, alumni temporarily close their restaurants,

56
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,720
or even let their sous chefs take over for them.

57
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,430
It's partly so they can recruit future staff.

58
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,430
Finding promising chefs is a challenging task.

59
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,400
Huh, okay.

60
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,650
I had no idea there was another purpose to the training camp.

61
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,650
Megumi probably doesn't realize
 what it means to get recruited by that lot.

62
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,110
Uh-huh.

63
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,820
Yukihira-kun, you would shine
 here at Tohtsuki Resort.

64
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,580
You're welcome to join us.

65
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,370
I appreciate the offer,

66
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,910
but I already have Yukihira.

67
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,670
That's right,

68
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,960
your family ran a restaurant, didn't it?

69
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,460
Yes, my father and I kept the
 place running by ourselves.

70
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,340
I don't know where he is or what he's doing,

71
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,890
but I want him to recognize my skills one day...

72
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,310
and to deem me worthy of taking over Yukihira.

73
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,370
Senpai, you're really going to try for those stars?

74
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,580
You heard?

75
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,670
How about I come and help you out?

76
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:01,290
Sure, I <i>was</i> thinking that I could use a servant.

77
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,210
Are you kidding me?!

78
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,060
Doujima-san?

79
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,640
Is something wrong?

80
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,940
No, it's nothing.

81
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,450
Okay, Souma-kun, this is our bus.

82
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,370
All right, see you later.

83
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,130
Crap, my headband!

84
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,590
Huh, you left something behind?

85
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,840
It's almost departure time.

86
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
Let me go—

87
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,800
I-It's all right!

88
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,640
I can go get it myself!

89
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,720
I'll go back in a different vehicle,

90
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,720
so you should go on ahead.
 Take my luggage with you.

91
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,060
O-Okay!

92
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,400
Whew.

93
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,310
It's a good thing I found it!

94
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,700
Well, that was a thoroughly enjoyable resort, wasn't it?

95
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,490
<i>Shoot, wrong bus.</i>

96
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,490
I'm already looking forward to next year's camp!

97
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,200
When there is a cluster of tour buses,

98
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,500
it is easy to mistake another bus for yours.

99
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,660
We strongly suggest that you confirm the parking spot

100
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,000
and bus number if you need to step outside.

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,550
Oh, you're the boy who made the souffle omelette.

102
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,300
Hey, the chicken egg guy.

103
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,340
That wasn't bad at all.

104
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,760
Um...

105
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,270
I'm sorry I wasted so many of your eggs!

106
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,350
Hm, I guess you <i>did</i> do that.

107
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:48,110
But I'll forgive you if you'll give my eggs preference

108
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:52,610
in your own restaurant someday. Okay?

109
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,830
I sure will!

110
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,160
I hope you'll use my beans too, boy!

111
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,040
My cheese too.

112
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,870
Hey, would you like some rice crackers?

113
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,290
Take these cough drops.

114
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,420
Oh, thanks.

115
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,340
Thanks! Thank you!

116
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,800
Wait, I need to get going!

117
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,130
Where's my bus?

118
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,260
Um...

119
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:12,720
Uh...

120
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,970
<i>I got left behind!</i>

121
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,200
<i>Seriously?</i>

122
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,970
<i>I made it through training camp,</i>

123
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,520
<i>only to have a major crisis now?</i>

124
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,650
Wh-Why are <i>you</i> still here?!

125
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,230
Why?

126
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,110
Well, it's a long story.

127
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,740
Lady Erina!

128
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,950
We've made arrangements
 for a car to take you home.

129
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,120
There happened to be one available.

130
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,240
Did he miss his bus as well?

131
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,680
Want some rice crackers?

132
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,970
No thank you.

133
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,240
Cough drops?

134
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,850
No need.

135
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,230
By the way,

136
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,230
I remember you saying that you'd enjoy seeing me get expelled.

137
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,250
I survived, though.

138
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,650
So how about them apples?

139
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,650
<i>I don't even have to look to know he has a smug grin on his face.</i>

140
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,660
You'd do well to flounder
 at the very bottom of the barrel.

141
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,500
I doubt you'll get through the Selection.

142
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,500
The Selection?

143
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,410
You don't know about it?

144
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,670
The Autumn Selection is a long-held Tohtsuki tradition.

145
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:35,300
It's a gourmet festival where select first-years are allowed to display their skills and compete.

146
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,090
The academy's board of directors and investors,

147
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,740
all heavyweights of the food industry, will be present.

148
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,180
It'll be the first opportunity for students to demonstrate their skills to those outside of the academy.

149
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,100
The selection process has already begun.

150
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,570
Didn't you notice that Selection Committee members were at the camp?

151
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,570
Oh, so that's who they were.

152
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,820
It was those suits, right?

153
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,570
In other words, this camp isn't just for weeding out the weak.

154
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,580
It's also meant to discreetly identify
 those who will ascend above the rest.

155
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,700
A gourmet festival, huh.

156
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,120
Sounds like fun!

157
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,460
I can't help but get revved up
 just thinking about it!

158
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,250
Like I said, there's no way someone
 like you would be selected!

159
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,220
What was all that about earlier, anyway?

160
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,300
<i>I did learn something from my mistake.</i>

161
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,050
Learn from your mistake?

162
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,060
That's what a loser says to cover up his failure.

163
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,390
Failure is not an option for chefs!

164
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,980
Is that so?

165
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,520
It is!

166
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,020
Only perfection can be served at the table.

167
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,740
That is the only way you can achieve the ultimate gourmet experience.

168
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,450
Just like his cooking.

169
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,660
Huh?

170
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,330
What was that?

171
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,580
Nothing.

172
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:52,080
By the way, why'd you end up missing the bus?

173
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,040
There's no need for me to tell you.

174
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,800
Oh, okay.

175
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,680
<i>I guess this is what you'd call an awkward situation.</i>

176
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,390
<i>Guess I'll go to sleep.</i>

177
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,740
<i>Found it!</i>

178
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,240
<i>Thank goodness.</i>

179
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,970
<i>I see.</i>

180
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,350
<i>So Yukihira Souma is your son, Jouichirou.</i>

181
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,950
Camp's finally over.

182
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,580
It's going to get noisy around here again.

183
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,820
That was awfully quick.

184
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,220
Well, my goodness.

185
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,550
If you were coming back, 
you should've called ahead!

186
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,890
You're still every bit as rude as you were.

187
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,480
I just happened to be passing through the area.

188
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:35,980
I'm back.

189
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,950
I'm back!

190
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,820
We're back!

191
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,280
Souma-kun, I hear you came back
 in one of the hotel's cars?

192
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,330
I'm so jealous!

193
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,630
That makes you a VIP! A VIP!

194
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,580
It wasn't anything that fancy.

195
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,580
In any event, I'm glad everyone came back safely.

196
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,800
You must all be tired.

197
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,990
I'll give you guys a good meal tonight.

198
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,270
Yay!

199
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,890
We haven't had Fumio-san's cooking in forever!

200
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,600
Well, <i>I</i> won't be the one cooking.

201
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,360
Hey, Souma.

202
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,320
You're back.

203
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,570
Help me out with this.

204
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,230
Sure.

205
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,950
I'd like you to prep this.

206
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,820
I've already made the stock.

207
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,190
Sure, got it.

208
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,220
Wait, I reacted like we're back home out of habit,

209
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,030
but what the hell are you doing here?!

210
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,700
What, you know each other?

211
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,640
Wh-Who is he?

212
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,290
He's an alumnus of Tohtsuki Academy and a former resident of Polar Star Dormitory.

213
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,250
A Tohtsuki alumnus?!

214
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,530
Must be the generation gap.

215
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,630
You don't know the former
 second seat of the Elite Ten,

216
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,800
Saiba Jouichirou?

217
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,960
The former second seat of the Elite Ten?!

218
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,760
"Saiba"?

219
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,960
Hey, the rice is almost done, Souma.

220
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,120
Forget the rice!

221
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,100
Just tell me what's going on, Dad!

222
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,920
You're family?!

223
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,860
Hm, I see now.

224
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,690
So Dad's an alumnus of Tohtsuki,

225
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,030
lived at Polar Star Dormitory,

226
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,190
and was in the Elite Ten.

227
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,370
Even for me, it's hard to take this all in.

228
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,600
Whoa, I've never seen Souma flustered before.

229
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,380
I guess it's not that unusual.
 He's Yukihira-kun's father, after all.

230
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,840
So you are Jouichirou Saiba.

231
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,130
Oh, you've heard of me?

232
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,840
Yes, I've come across your name in past documents.

233
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:36,100
You were described as a nomadic chef who worked his magic in famous restaurants around the world.

234
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,400
But after a time,

235
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,600
you vanished from the front lines.

236
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,710
You became a legend known only to a select few.

237
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,240
I am the current seventh seat of the Elite Ten,

238
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,520
Isshiki Satoshi.

239
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,890
I'm honored to meet you, Chef Saiba.

240
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,800
Oh, I go by Yukihira now.

241
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,330
You can just call me Jouichirou.

242
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,120
H-He's not disturbed by Isshiki-senpai's appearance in the least.

243
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,250
He's not a former Elite Ten for nothing.

244
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,630
What's that have to do with anything?

245
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,630
I didn't know Dad was so famous.

246
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,140
You really had no idea?!

247
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,510
Well, I only learned recently that he'd worked overseas before.

248
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,730
We used to get calls in languages
 I didn't understand,

249
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,940
and I'd come across tons of
 photos of him with foreigners.

250
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,460
I thought that every family
 experienced those sorts of things.

251
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,210
They don't!

252
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:29,990
You should've noticed!

253
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,160
<i>Who knew Souma-kun's father
 was such a great man?</i>

254
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,370
Well, let's have a toast!

255
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,750
This is to celebrate all of you surviving the camp.

256
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,220
Don't hold back tonight!

257
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,170
Thanks for the food!

258
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,420
Cheers!

259
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,280
F-Food made by a former Elite Ten member...

260
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,800
I wonder what it tastes like.

261
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,840
<i>Somehow... I'm really nervous.</i>

262
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,770
Please, try some.

263
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,640
O-Okay!

264
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,620
I can see it!

265
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,360
I can see it!

266
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,160
<i>Places I've never been...</i>

267
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,200
<i>Vistas of foreign lands...</i>

268
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,410
<i>It's all coming to life in my mind!</i>

269
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,250
<i>This is the essence of Arabia!</i>

270
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,040
It's delicious!

271
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,220
What's this paste spread on the lamb?

272
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,590
That's harissa.

273
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:40,310
It's an all-purpose chili pepper spice blend from North Africa.

274
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,140
Using traditional Middle Eastern cooking as a base,

275
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,480
I tried adding parsley and
 garam masala this time around.

276
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,780
J-Jouichirou-san, what's this?

277
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,990
That's zuppa di pesce.

278
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,740
It's a Ligurian seafood soup with stocca fisso.

279
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,920
What about this one, Jouichirou-san?!

280
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,360
P-Please tell us about this too!

281
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,620
Oh, that's...

282
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,960
Jouichirou-san's such a hunk.

283
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,770
Yeah, he gives off this manly aura.

284
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,900
Even the guys are all over him.

285
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,740
Will Yukihira...

286
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,880
...turn out that way too?

287
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,080
<i>Huh? What now?</i>

288
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,560
<i>They were all wound up tight
 when they first met him,</i>

289
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,350
<i>but a single bite has opened their hearts.</i>

290
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:31,020
<i>This dish is bursting with its creator's personality!</i>

291
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,300
Whoa! This dish is awesome too!

292
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,660
Wow! They're all super delicious!

293
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,240
What about this one?

294
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,290
<i>Disgusting!</i>

295
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,560
Oh, that one!

296
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,250
I tried to recreate a snake dish I had last month.

297
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,330
It's so disgusting!

298
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,200
They chop the snake up with the skin still on,

299
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,560
and then they boil the pieces
 without any further prep work.

300
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,430
Dad, this sucks big time!

301
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,560
Right?

302
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,330
It's easily in the top ten best disgusting dishes.

303
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:06,480
Yukihira Family

304
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:06,480
Isolation Ward

305
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,840
Wouldn't that make it the ten <i>worst</i> dishes, then?

306
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,010
Are you sure it's not in the top four?

307
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,060
Heck, maybe the top two.

308
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,060
Oh, I get it now.

309
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,480
This is <i>Yukihira's</i> father we're talking about.

310
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,480
I think the top two were those, y'know...

311
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,940
Well, the one quirk aside... Jouichirou.

312
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,900
They used to called you "The Demon."

313
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,240
But you're cooking really gentle dishes these days.

314
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,660
Yeah.

315
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,360
You ought to let Gin try
 a dish of yours sometime.

316
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,500
I guess you're right.

317
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,620
You don't mean—

318
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,600
That's right.

319
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,830
He was acting all high and 
mighty at camp, wasn't he?

320
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,920
Doujima Gin, the head chef of Tohtsuki Resort.

321
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,050
Here, this is Gin,

322
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,890
and this is Jouichirou.

323
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,260
They were second-year high schoolers at the time.

324
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,600
They're both so young!

325
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,400
Fumio-san, please don't show them things like that.

326
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,610
Why not?

327
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:56,760
So Chef Doujima was also from Polar Star.

328
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,820
Seriously?

329
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,970
Doujima Gin, the first seat of the Elite Ten.

330
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,280
Saiba Jouichirou, the second seat.

331
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,580
When these two became the core,

332
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,870
Polar Star entered a golden age.

333
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,390
We won victory after victory in Cooking Battles,

334
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,240
seized acre after acre and expanded the dorm,

335
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,410
invested in ever larger kitchen facilities,

336
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,040
and secured procurement routes for ingredients.

337
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,430
We were fully self-sufficient.

338
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,010
More like, we were a nation unto ourselves!

339
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,690
Those fields you're using out back,

340
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,190
the fermentation workshop,

341
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,400
and the large hen house—

342
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,740
all of those were built back when
 Gin and Jouichirou's crew were around.

343
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,450
Still, while Gin never fails to send a New Year's greeting card and mid-year gift...

344
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,990
Jouichirou!

345
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,250
Why don't you ever write a letter once in a while?

346
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,830
I do come by to see you sometimes, don't I?

347
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,920
As if!

348
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,670
You just wander in and wander out!

349
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,680
Talk about the legendary graduate.

350
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,140
Strictly speaking, I never actually graduated.

351
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,440
What? You didn't?

352
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,770
But you were the second seat.

353
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,520
A lot of things happened.

354
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,660
Is Gin doing well?

355
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,160
Y-Yeah.

356
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:29,960
Dad.

357
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,540
Yeah?

358
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,830
What was...

359
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,420
Polar Star Dormitory like back then?

360
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,130
It was fun.

361
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,470
Everyone worked on perfecting their craft however they could.

362
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,280
Dad, want to sleep in my room tonight?

363
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,620
I guess.

364
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,450
Souma, you're in 303?

365
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,000
Yeah, why?

366
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,790
In the middle of the room...

367
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,800
there's a scorch mark from
 when a pot fell on the floor.

368
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,130
It used to be my room.

369
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:27,120
Fumio-san, let me stay in one of the empty rooms!

370
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,260
Sure!

371
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,440
<i>This was Dad's room.</i>

372
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,630
<i>Saiba Jouichirou, huh?</i>

373
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,750
<i>Really now,</i>

374
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:06,570
<i>just how much do I actually know...</i>

375
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,470
<i>about that man?</i>

376
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,980
Souma!

377
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,400
Souma!

378
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,890
Are you up?

379
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:47,980
Yeah.

380
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,980
I'm in the kitchen right now.

381
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,400
Bring your knives and come join me.

382
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,790
Maybe he's prepping breakfast?

383
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,750
<i>Come to think of it, why </i>did<i>
 Dad come back to Japan?</i>

384
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,420
<i>I wonder if it has something to do with a job.</i>

385
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,250
Oh, there you are.

386
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,500
You've sharpened your knives, right?

387
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,610
Of course.

388
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,630
I did it last night so the smell of the whetstone—

389
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,130
Okay, good.

390
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,260
Well, sorry to spring this on you,

391
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,600
but I need you to show me
 how much you've grown...

392
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,930
or how much you haven't.

393
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,360
Let's have our first cooking
 contest in a long time...

394
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,440
Souma.

395
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,660
Next time on <i>Shokugeki no Souma</i>,

396
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,670
the sixteenth dish.

397
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,450
Thanks for waiting!

398
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,580
The Chef Who's Crossed a Thousand Leagues.

399
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,830
Do have a taste.
