1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,980
That time has come once more.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,480
Have the students been informed?

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,030
They will all be notified by day's end.

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,780
At the academy, some will rise and some will fall.

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,700
This is where their paths begin to diverge.

6
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,720
Training camp?

7
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,550
It's that time of year again, huh?

8
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,510
What's this about?

9
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,970
You had something like this in middle school, didn't you?

10
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,470
We're going to a camp and staying there for a few nights.

11
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:09,020
Really? I had no idea the academy did stuff like that.

12
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,440
Why are you trembling, Tadokoro?

13
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:17,650
This camp represents the first circle of hell
 for new high school students.

14
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,010
All first-years will be tasked with
 grueling cooking projects every day,

15
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,540
in a remote location in the mountains.

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,750
If we don't earn a passing score,

17
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,460
we face immediate expulsion.

18
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,750
They claim it's an opportunity to strengthen our bonds,

19
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,050
it's a merciless gauntlet for
 weeding out the weak!

20
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,800
This is what they mean by
 education through competition.

21
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,810
The director spoke of the one percent.

22
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,810
This is where the selection process really begins.

23
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,940
Isshiki-senpai, you went to
 this camp last year, right?

24
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,730
Yes, of course.

25
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:01,450
When I attended last year's training camp,
dozens were expelled and sent home each day.

26
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,910
Expelled?

27
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,490
After one camp some years ago,

28
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,450
half of the participating students
 were shown the door.

29
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,500
Half?

30
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,250
Megumi?!

31
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,670
I'm grateful for the time
 we've had together, everyone.

32
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,630
Megumi!

33
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,680
Okay, so we can bring playing cards and shogi sets,

34
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,030
but video games aren't allowed.

35
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,560
What, they don't give us any time for taking baths?

36
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,810
Hey, Yukihira!

37
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,020
How can you be so carefree and be planning your trip already?

38
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,520
Megumi's practically on her deathbed here!

39
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,690
Half the class will make it, right?

40
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,690
All we have to do is be in that half.

41
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,490
I'm also quite certain

42
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,370
that everyone in Polar Star
 will come back smiling.

43
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,850
I'll make it back here!

44
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,770
I sure will!

45
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,000
Of course.

46
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,630
You're right.

47
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,000
We're all so determined!

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,920
We Polar Stars strike fear into the hearts of men!

49
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,010
We do?

50
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,160
Let's dominate this camp!

51
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,400
That's the spirit.

52
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,850
Fumio-san and I will hold the fort.

53
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,810
Give it your best shot!

54
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,890
Yeah!

55
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,890
Okay!

56
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,690
Got it!

57
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,440
I'm on fire!

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,100
That concludes the overview.

59
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,480
Please don't forget anything.

60
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,530
You'll depart in three days.

61
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,570
Everyone is to assemble at 6:00 AM.

62
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,490
I see.

63
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,320
Thank you, Hisako.

64
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,930
My stomach hurts!

65
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,270
I'm kind of getting jaded.

66
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,810
A'ight!

67
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,140
Let's go!

68
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,730
Off to the friendship and
 team-building camp from hell!

69
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,980
Nothing's gonna surprise me any more!

70
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,130
Wow!

71
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,220
Th-This is our "camp" site?

72
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,380
Guess this school is full of rich guys for a reason.

73
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,050
They even run a big-ass hotel.

74
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,270
All of the hotels and inns around
 here belong to Tohtsuki.

75
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,730
Heh, doesn't surprise me one bit!

76
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,060
They manage a dozen or so accommodations under the Tohtsuki Resorts brand,

77
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,940
and graduates often end up working in the resorts' culinary division.

78
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,320
I've heard it costs upwards of 80,000 yen
 per night at these places.

79
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,700
That's like a month's rent!

80
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,490
I'm definitely not surprised at all!

81
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,910
You're totally surprised, Souma-kun.

82
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,200
Wait, so we're staying here tonight?

83
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,370
Wow, this is super exciting!

84
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,420
<i>If</i> we can survive today's task.

85
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,510
Boo!

86
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,220
Ibusaki, you're such a downer.

87
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,510
I'm just being realistic.

88
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:09,720
See?

89
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,100
There's an assembly as soon as we drop off our bags.

90
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,500
Okay.

91
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,110
<i>It's too quiet.</i>

92
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,530
<i>It's hard to believe that nearly
 a thousand students are here.</i>

93
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,860
<i>That's right.</i>

94
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,200
<i>What's about to start is the training camp from hell.</i>

95
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,880
<i>How many of us will survive?</i>

96
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,790
Look, it's Nikumi!

97
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,380
Y-Yukihira!

98
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,250
Been a while, Nikumi!

99
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,210
You're not nervous at all, huh?

100
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,550
Hey, Yukihira-kun!

101
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,010
Why are you calling her by a nickname?

102
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,050
Huh? But she's fine with it.

103
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,050
Right, Nikumi?

104
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,720
Of course not!

105
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,720
See?

106
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,930
It's the transfer student.

107
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,930
She likes it.

108
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,390
Yukihira Souma.

109
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,310
Be careful, Yukihira.

110
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,230
Huh? About what?

111
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,070
Good morning, students!

112
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,660
I will now provide an overview of this camp.

113
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,200
You're scheduled to stay here
 for five nights and six days.

114
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,240
During this time, you'll split off into several groups

115
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,210
and take on a new assignment each day.

116
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:24,920
Students whose instructors' evaluations fall below a certain baseline will be failed,

117
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,880
sent back to the academy,

118
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,090
and expelled.

119
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,680
To evaluate your tasks,

120
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,510
we have invited some guest lecturers.

121
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:35,850
Guests?

122
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,770
They're Tohtsuki alumni who have graciously agreed to join us,

123
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,770
in spite of their busy schedules.

124
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,980
Tohtsuki alumni?

125
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,490
That means...

126
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,950
they're all geniuses who managed to remain in the 90th percentile!

127
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,120
Hm, you over there.

128
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,750
Nine rows back,

129
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,840
the boy with a scar on his eyebrow.

130
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,920
Oh, sorry.

131
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,170
I mean the one to your right.

132
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,900
Yeah, you.

133
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,720
You're expelled.

134
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,470
You may leave now.

135
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,180
What?!

136
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,390
Your hair product has a citrus scent.

137
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,640
It interferes with the aroma of the food.

138
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,180
We <i>do</i> need to pay attention
 to our sense of style.

139
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,650
If chefs have no sense of style,
 their dishes will have no appeal.

140
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,570
But you should choose an unscented hair product from now on.

141
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,700
Wait!

142
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,320
I'm getting expelled just for <i>that</i>?!

143
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,740
Just <i>that</i> can be enough to lose your customers.

144
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,420
Are you trying to destroy my restaurant?

145
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,180
Farewell, student.

146
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,590
Who's that?

147
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,550
It's Chef Shinomiya!

148
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,510
He's the first Japanese national to win the French Pluspol award!

149
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,180
Not to mention...

150
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,640
Onstage are also Chef Mizuhara from F,

151
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,100
and Head Chef Sekimori from the sushi restaurant Ginza Hinowa!

152
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,520
Wow!

153
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,440
They're all people featured
 in magazines every month!

154
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,570
You, girl who is innocent like a white clover!

155
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,070
That's Donato Gotoda of the auberge Tesoro!

156
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,950
You may be the reason for my existence.

157
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:25,580
Why don't we talk through the night till dawn at my auberge?

158
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,830
Um, what?

159
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,830
Um, excuse me!

160
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:31,050
Let go of her hand, Chef Gotoda.

161
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,420
Hinako.

162
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,510
It's Inui Hinako of the Japanese restaurant Kirinoya!

163
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,300
I'm sorry that you had such a frightening experience.

164
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,810
You're very cute, by the way.

165
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,060
I'm sure you'd be very good to eat.

166
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,310
Hinako.

167
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,480
Chapelle-sensei's glaring at us.

168
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,730
Let's go.

169
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,860
Oh.

170
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,070
Please come by my restaurant sometime!

171
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,410
Pssssh...

172
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,910
Oh! That's...

173
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,870
That's the man who graduated first in his class

174
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,250
after getting the highest score ever on the graduation exam!

175
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:11,380
He turned down over 800 offers from 
high-caliber restaurants around the world.

176
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,840
Instead, he took the position of Executive Chef and Company Director of Tohtsuki Resorts!

177
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,130
Doujima Gin!

178
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,850
This is incredible.

179
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:24,060
All the star chefs leading Japan's culinary world

180
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,640
are lined up in front of me!

181
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,900
Welcome to my Tohtsuki Resort.

182
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:36,990
Each of the alumni who have gathered here today is a chef who owns his or her own restaurant.

183
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,030
For the next six days of the training camp,

184
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,700
we will treat you as we would our own staff.

185
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,830
Do you understand what that entails?

186
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,160
Those who cannot perform to our expectations...

187
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,290
will be fired!

188
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,500
Or in your case, expelled.

189
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,380
As you have already seen, at their discretion,
 you may be dismissed at the drop of a hat.

190
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,090
I wish you all the best of luck.

191
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,700
Now, proceed to your groups!

192
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,270
We're all split up, but I wish you all the best!

193
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,400
I'm with you <i>again</i>?!

194
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,520
What's it to you?!

195
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,730
Later!

196
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,770
Yeah!

197
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,070
Oh, don't forget we're having
a card game in Marui's room later!

198
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,900
You don't all have to come
 to my room even during camp!

199
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,950
Wanna drink?

200
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,290
Sure.

201
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,790
It seems you're all here.

202
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:39,760
In my class, you'll be working in pairs.

203
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,430
You'll be in the same pairs as in your first practicum of the semester.

204
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,260
Please go to your workstations.

205
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,520
Thank goodness! I'm with you again, Souma-kun!

206
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,810
Yup, let's give this a whirl.

207
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,690
Yukihira Souma, is it?

208
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,020
Yeah, so?

209
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,030
You've been grinding your foot
into mine for the last ten seconds,

210
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,080
so I guess I can assume it's intentional?

211
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,160
Of course.

212
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,160
I was wondering when I'd get to mess with you during camp,

213
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,460
but I didn't think I'd be lucky enough
 to get close to you in our first task.

214
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,210
I'll crush you, just like I did your shoe.

215
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:17,920
<i>Huh?</i>

216
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,630
U-Um, we already know it's going
 to be an intense camp.

217
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,380
W-We shouldn't be fighting on top of that.

218
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,680
I can finally put you in your place.

219
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,600
That makes me happy, Yukihira Souma!

220
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,990
I see.

221
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,810
Well, good for you.

222
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,560
I get the picture already, so move your foot!

223
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,770
Okay, everyone!

224
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,640
I'll be sitting right here,

225
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,740
so feel free to ask me any
 questions you might have.

226
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,660
Excuse me, Chef Inui,

227
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,530
but we weren't given any instructions.

228
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,160
Oh, is that right?

229
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,290
Let me see.

230
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,410
Hm, my task for you is this.

231
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,880
Use the ingredients there to make a dish
 that could serve as a main course in Japanese cuisine.

232
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,260
Ingredients? But...

233
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,720
There's nothing there.

234
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,720
Of course there is!

235
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,010
We're amid glorious nature, 
right next to a clear stream.

236
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,970
There are ingredients galore.

237
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,850
We also have spices, condiments, and oil,

238
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,390
not to mention cooking utensils.

239
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,570
You are welcome to use other tools, 
such as fishing poles.

240
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,490
We're on private property that is encircled by a fence.

241
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,740
If you cross that fence, you will be disqualified.

242
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,240
Obtain your ingredients from this limited space and prepare them.

243
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:36,080
You will pass if you create a dish
 that I find satisfactory.

244
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,710
This session is two hours long,

245
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,960
so you should probably get to it.

246
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,840
Huh? You mean we should've already started?!

247
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,340
Why didn't you say so?!

248
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,010
We have to figure out what we can fish up first!

249
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:49,930
Sweetfish!

250
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,720
We can just grill it with salt!

251
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,640
But are they even in season right now?!

252
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,350
Whatever! We have less than two hours!

253
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,850
Hurry!

254
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,400
It's face-off time, Yukihira!

255
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,320
What do you mean?

256
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,190
Let's decide who's the better chef.

257
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,160
Chef Inui, I'd like you to make the call.

258
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,580
Please use your rigorous judgment and decide whose cooking tastes better!

259
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,750
Um, what?

260
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,330
That has nothing to do with my task, 
so I would prefer not to.

261
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,090
Oh. I suppose you're right.

262
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,420
Hey, what're you gonna do?

263
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,870
Because you got on your high horse, 
you're making everyone uncomfortable.

264
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,560
That was really lame, bro!

265
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,640
Shut up! Don't you laugh at me too!

266
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,480
<i>"Bro"?! They're </i>brothers<i>?!</i>

267
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,350
<i>They look nothing alike!</i>

268
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,810
I-In any case, I cannot lose to you!

269
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,940
I'll make a dish that tops yours!

270
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,330
Got it, Yukihira?!

271
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,200
C'mon, let's go!

272
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,150
What's up with him?

273
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,450
Oh, Souma-kun!

274
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,950
We should get going too!

275
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,780
Good luck!

276
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,330
<i>Everyone develops tunnel vision
 when placed in an unfamiliar situation.</i>

277
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,920
Damn it! I'm not getting any bites!

278
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,880
Quiet, idiot! You're scaring the fish away!

279
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,920
Okay! I can make this into a meuniÃ¨re.

280
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,670
But we don't have any flour!

281
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,220
I told you to look for something like bamboo shoots!

282
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,180
I <i>did</i> look, but I couldn't find anything!

283
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:11,760
Bamboo Shoot

284
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:11,760
m 847.5 577.5 l 1099.5 577.5 1099.5 663 847.5 663

285
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:12,470
Bamboo Shoot

286
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:12,470
m 847.5 577.5 l 1099.5 577.5 1099.5 663 847.5 663

287
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,130
Bamboo Shoot

288
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,130
m 847.5 577.5 l 1099.5 577.5 1099.5 663 847.5 663

289
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,390
<i>Their thinking slows to a crawl,</i>

290
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,550
<i>and they misjudge their options.</i>

291
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,430
<i>This task is merely a warm-up exercise.</i>

292
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:24,690
<i>Any chef who's daunted by something
 like this isn't needed at Tohtsuki.</i>

293
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,150
We need to finish fishing ASAP and get cooking!

294
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,200
What should we cook, Souma-kun?

295
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,530
If we get char or rainbow trout, maybe we can grill it with salt?

296
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,160
Or maybe braise it?

297
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,000
We have to think of the accompaniments too!

298
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,580
Maybe there are mountain
 vegetables or something!

299
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:43,760
But everyone else will be thinking 
the same way, y'know?

300
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,090
I want to go for a bit of a twist.

301
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,670
We don't have time for that!

302
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,090
We have to finish our dish!

303
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,840
Sure, but...

304
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,060
You caught it!

305
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,810
Yay!

306
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,230
We managed to get the fish, at least.

307
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,310
Yup.

308
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,020
We just have to figure out how to prepare 'em.

309
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,030
Please use your rigorous judgment!

310
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,620
Shut up!

311
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,530
Shut up, okay?

312
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,410
You guys are using fish too?

313
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,330
This is ridiculous.

314
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,310
Everyone's going with fish because of the theme.

315
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,620
Isn't that awfully narrow-minded?

316
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,790
Get off your high horse.

317
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,710
You got something better?

318
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,550
Can't you tell?

319
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,380
It's duck!

320
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,220
What?! Duck?!

321
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,600
We didn't just find duck.

322
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,010
There were chickens and rabbits too.

323
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,140
We were wondering why
 no one else was around.

324
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,940
Damn it!

325
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,310
I had no idea there were 
ingredients other than river fish.

326
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,730
But it's not like we've ever 
dressed that kind of meat.

327
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,440
Out of my way.

328
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,070
Step aside, Yukihira.

329
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,070
Isami!

330
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:57,950
Okay!

331
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,290
<i>He's separating the breast and
 thigh meat with such precision.</i>

332
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,710
<i>But despite that speed,</i>

333
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,630
<i>he's not damaging the innards at all.</i>

334
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,130
<i>What agile knife work.</i>

335
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,840
Yes? Did you want to ask me something?

336
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,600
N-No, I was just admiring your skills.

337
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,890
Really?

338
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,560
But my brother can finish this 
three times faster than me.

339
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,990
<i>There's no break in the work flow between any steps.</i>

340
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,820
<i>His moves are smooth and efficient.</i>

341
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,820
<i>Just who </i>is<i> he?</i>

342
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,040
Well, I had no doubt that he'd be at least this good.

343
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,540
He has hands that look like
they'd been tested in an actual kitchen.

344
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,920
Forno accendere.

345
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,170
Forgive my belated introduction.

346
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,470
My name is Takumi Aldini.

347
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,800
This is my younger twin.

348
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,850
Isami Aldini.

349
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,180
We previously worked in 
our family's trattoria in Italy.

350
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,310
"Trattoria"?

351
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,520
In Italian, it means a restaurant for the masses.

352
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,860
I'm the same as you, Yukihira.

353
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,320
I too am a chef who's been protecting his restaurant on the front lines.

354
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,240
I remember what you said 
at the opening ceremony.

355
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,250
<i>I don't plan on losing to folks
who've never served a single customer.</i>

356
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,330
You identified yourself as a professional.

357
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,460
As a fellow professional, I cannot lose to you.

358
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:36,670
Let's show the world who's the better chef, Aldini or Yukihira!

359
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,590
Great!

360
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,390
Come at me!

361
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,140
What?!

362
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:43,470
Very well.

363
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,310
What's that?!

364
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,980
<i>A mezzaluna.</i>

365
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,400
<i>A double-handed knife used in Italy whose name means "half-moon."</i>

366
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,400
Let's go!

367
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,190
Tritare!

368
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,530
He has complete mastery over that strange knife!

369
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,240
The ingredients are rapidly turning into a paste!

370
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,330
The duck's almost done.

371
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,950
We'll finish the salsa at the same time.

372
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,950
Got it.

373
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,330
I'm ready.

374
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,580
All right!

375
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,710
What?!

376
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,100
Tre...

377
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,560
Due...

378
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,020
Uno...

379
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,730
Fine!

380
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,280
You're the first to finish!

381
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:42,200
Nimbleness is one of Italian
 cuisine's charms, after all.

382
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,780
<i>They're way too fast!</i>

383
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,830
<i>They had to dress the duck too!</i>

384
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,660
<i>I can't believe they didn't even take an hour!</i>

385
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,000
Grilled duck with herbs

386
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,370
and a green sauce.

387
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,250
Buon appetito!

388
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,460
Well then,

389
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,460
I'll have a taste.

390
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:09,720
<i>The fragrant, wild flavor of the duck 
is heightened by the astringent sauce!</i>

391
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:18,900
<i>The masculinity and class of this dish is like a heavy bass resounding in the recesses of my stomach.</i>

392
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,150
<i>It is as if...</i>

393
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,260
<i>the duck were singing an aria.</i>

394
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,040
<i>I wouldn't mind being embraced</i>

395
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,420
<i>by a duck like this!</i>

396
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:39,960
Hey!

397
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,450
That green sauce.

398
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,340
Isn't it salsa verde?

399
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:48,970
Isn't that a staple in Italian cuisine, made from chopped anchovies and flat-leaf parsley?

400
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,560
What are they thinking?!

401
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,270
The theme's Japanese cuisine!

402
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,440
They're gonna get failed for sure!

403
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,770
No, this sauce was not prepared with anchovies

404
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,070
but with uruka, salted sweetfish offal.

405
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,360
Uruka is traditionally made over the course of a week or more,

406
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,240
but this one is instant, isn't it?

407
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,870
Yes.

408
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,000
We boiled the rinsed sweetfish guts in sake,

409
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,620
then seasoned it with mirin, soy sauce, and salt.

410
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,420
We were able to quickly make a rich uruka,

411
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,840
with just the right amount of bitterness.

412
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,380
How is that possible?

413
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,300
That wasn't their only ingenious idea.

414
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,130
Instead of parsley, they chopped perilla and chives,

415
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:30,810
producing the vibrant green
 color and astringent flavor.

416
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:34,980
They also subbed in yuzu pepper
 paste instead of garlic,

417
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,940
which is rarely used in Japanese cuisine,

418
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,270
in order to bring the dish closer to the theme.

419
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,570
That's right!

420
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,860
This is Japanese-style salsa verde,

421
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,530
using instant uruka as the base!

422
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,530
They created a Japanese version of an Italian sauce?

423
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,200
Damn it!

424
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,330
I'm getting hungry just listening to them talk.

425
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:55,210
How'd they manage to combine that many ingredients out here in the mountains?

426
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,830
<i>Unlike Japan,</i>

427
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,460
<i>Italy has a long tradition of meat-based cuisine.</i>

428
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,760
<i>In their homeland of Tuscany,</i>

429
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,510
<i>meats such as duck, rabbit, and boar are served when in season.</i>

430
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:13,520
<i>They must've learned how to
 dress duck while living there.</i>

431
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:18,780
<i>The breast has been basted with a sauce made from soy sauce, mustard, black pepper, and honey,</i>

432
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,360
<i>then grilled to aromatic perfection.</i>

433
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,520
<i>It pairs well with the sauce.</i>

434
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:27,450
You've introduced core elements of Japanese cuisine into both the duck and the salsa verde,

435
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,910
and you've pulled it all together into an exquisite Japanese dish.

436
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,830
Takumi Aldini and Isami Aldini,

437
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,830
you have passed my test.

438
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,080
Grazie!

439
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,830
<i>He used his wits to create an exceptional dish,</i>

440
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,960
<i>despite the limitations imposed upon us.</i>

441
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,340
<i>He reminds me...</i>

442
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,760
<i>of Souma-kun.</i>

443
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,860
Ah! Merveilleuse!

444
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,860
Nakiri Erina, you have passed my test!

445
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,580
Good day.

446
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,710
Next time on <i>Shokugeki no Souma</i>,

447
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,250
the ninth dish:

448
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,240
The Batter to Adorn the Mountains.

449
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,540
Grazie!

450
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,590
Grazie.

451
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,030
I'm gonna step on you!

452
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,260
Bro, you're being lame.
