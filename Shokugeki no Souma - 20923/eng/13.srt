1
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,230
Isshiki-senpai, we're back!

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,400
Welcome back, everyone!

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,300
I see that all of you survived the camp from hell.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,450
Good job-

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,820
We are back.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,910
Souma-kun?!

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,760
You look so much more manly.

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,910
The tasks must've been very challenging!

9
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:29,750
Chew, chew, chew.

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,500
Tadokoro-chan?!

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,960
Is that really you, Tadokoro-chan?

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,750
You're all kinds of rough around the edges!

13
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:30,960
Shut your trap!

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,550
Huh?!

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,840
Boss!

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,050
Whaddya say we beat the crap out of him?

17
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,140
Let's do it!

18
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,850
Hey! All of you better respect your elders,

19
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,100
or there's gonna be hell to pay!

20
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,230
Ibusaki-kun, your charming hairstyle's been ruined.

21
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,110
Scruff.

22
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,530
Come to think of it, where's Marui-kun?

23
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,490
I don't see him with you.

24
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,780
This was all that we could find of him.

25
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,910
Th-This can't be...

26
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,910
Marui-kun!

27
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,040
It was only a dream.

28
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,130
Today is the third day of camp.

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,970
I hope you're all okay.

30
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,690
No good!

31
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:36,740
Start over!

32
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,840
Good, you pass the test.

33
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,790
You may clean up now, Tadokoro Megumi.

34
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,950
Thank you!

35
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,710
Watch where you're going!

36
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,290
S-Sorry!

37
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,130
<i>Nice work, Tadokoro.</i>

38
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,220
<i>You've still got some rough patches, but...</i>

39
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,800
<i>Not enough.</i>

40
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,220
<i>Still not enough.</i>

41
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,770
<i>Perfect!</i>

42
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,400
<i>I have to do better.</i>

43
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,980
<i>I have to!</i>

44
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,090
You'd best relieve yourself of the notion that you can stay the queen bee forever.

45
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,930
Thank you for the advice.

46
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,390
I'll do my best to keep what you said in mind...

47
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,020
as the prattle of the unwashed masses.

48
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,740
Today was another tough one!

49
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,660
I want to pass out in my room already.

50
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,490
We only have two more days of this.

51
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,450
We might scrape by.

52
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:33,960
Strange.

53
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,120
I don't see a time listed for lights out.

54
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,630
You're right.

55
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,960
Maybe it got left out by mistake?

56
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,970
Students of Tohtsuki Academy!

57
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,060
One hour from now, at ten o'clock,

58
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,930
assemble in the banquet hall in your uniforms.

59
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,810
What?!

60
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,810
What the hell?

61
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,190
What a drag.

62
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,650
Wow, the herd's really thinned out.

63
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,650
Everyone's exhausted, of course.

64
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,620
What could they have planned
 at this time of night?

65
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,990
Yukihira!

66
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,080
Hey!

67
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,460
Don't go pulling ridiculous stunts like challenging an alumnus to a Cooking Battle, idiot!

68
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,960
How dare you risk getting kicked out of Tohtsuki without first settling your score with me?!

69
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,610
Who the hell are you?

70
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,840
That's <i>my</i> line.

71
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,590
How did you guys know
 about the Cooking Battle?

72
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,340
Everyone's been talking about it!

73
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,260
Hang on. If Yukihira's here right now,
 wouldn't that mean...

74
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,180
No way! You beat Chef Shinomiya?!

75
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,600
Did you really?!

76
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,190
Nah, I blew it.

77
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,230
Huh?!

78
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,360
Is that so?

79
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,400
Can we please stop talking about this?

80
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,900
No way! Explain yourself!

81
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,320
What happened?!

82
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,240
Hey!

83
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,320
Look!

84
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,620
Erina-sama!

85
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,620
It's Erina-sama.

86
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,080
All eyes up front!

87
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,720
We've gathered all of you here for one reason and one reason only:

88
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,340
to explain to you what tomorrow's task will be.

89
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,590
Tomorrow?

90
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,550
Why bother telling us that the night before?

91
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:17,020
Your assignment will be to create a new breakfast menu worthy of being served to the guests of Tohtsuki Resort.

92
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,060
Breakfasts are the face of the hotel.

93
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,940
It is an important meal because it is what starts the guests' day.

94
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:31,370
I'd like you all to come up with an innovative dish that will make a vibrant contribution to the breakfast table.

95
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,820
The main ingredient will be eggs.

96
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,950
Your dish may be of whatever cuisine you'd like,

97
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,120
but it must be capable of being served buffet style.

98
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,130
The judging will begin at 6 o'clock tomorrow morning.

99
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,550
Make sure that your dish is ready by then.

100
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,340
Did I hear that right?

101
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,100
He meant six in the evening, right?

102
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,520
No, he definitely said "morning."

103
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,430
W-Wait!

104
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,980
We have no time to waste on sleep!

105
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,690
You're free to decide how to spend your time.

106
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,400
You can work on your recipe
 in one of the many kitchens,

107
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,450
or go and get some rest in your room.

108
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,360
I'll see you all again in the morning.

109
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,780
Dismissed!

110
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,370
No way.

111
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,370
I'm already in pieces.

112
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,500
My brain's barely working as it is!

113
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,380
Finally, a task worth competing over.

114
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,920
Just you wait, Yukihira.

115
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,750
Hm?

116
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,880
I'll deliver the ultimate breakfast:

117
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,550
a traditional Italian egg dish that's been prepared with the Aldinis' expertise!

118
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:39,520
What's in this traditional Italian egg dish of yours?

119
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,400
Well, aside from the eggs, you take 
some cheese and vegetables and—

120
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,560
What are you doing, Isami?!

121
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,820
Stop giving away our secrets!

122
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,530
C'mon, let's get out of here!

123
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,530
Fine, fine.

124
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,490
Come to think of it, 
my transfer exam also featured eggs.

125
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,290
<i>The main ingredient will be eggs.</i>

126
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,040
<i>Make one dish.</i>

127
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,580
<i>Here you go!</i>

128
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,080
Doesn't this bring back memories, Nakiri?

129
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,880
D-Don't you dare act so familiar with me!

130
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,800
A word of advice.

131
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,590
Don't make a low-class dish like last time.

132
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,350
If you want to avoid embarrassing yourself in front of the judges, that is.

133
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,390
But it seemed like you enjoyed it, didn't you—

134
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,810
Huh? What are you talking about?!

135
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,310
I told you that it was disgusting!

136
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,770
Erina-sama!

137
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,480
I've secured a kitchen.

138
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,570
Very well.

139
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,740
Let us be on our way, then.

140
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,450
Well, good luck racking your
 nonexistent brains over this one.

141
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,200
Good day.

142
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,460
Um, are you guys all right?

143
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,170
Fine, I'll show them what I've got!

144
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,710
Hey, Marui! Stand up!

145
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,630
We're all going back to the dorm together!

146
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,840
Polar Star!

147
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,800
Fight!

148
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,630
Yeah!

149
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,630
Y-Yeah!

150
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,970
What a quiet night.

151
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,510
It's very different from the typical scene during a task,

152
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,730
what with all the yelling.

153
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,100
Indeed.

154
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,730
But all things considered,

155
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:13,190
I would expect the students to be more frustrated than they'd usually be.

156
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,530
I wonder if this'll work.

157
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,240
Maybe I'll try another seasoning.

158
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,240
This assignment is more cruel than I thought.

159
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,000
You're right.

160
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,960
Unless you're extremely confident in what you've
 come up with, there's no way you'd go to bed early.

161
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,500
I'm retiring to bed.

162
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,800
Will you continue to test recipes?

163
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,610
Y-Yes.

164
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,470
I'm still only halfway done.

165
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,680
I see.

166
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,260
Don't stay up too late.

167
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,580
<i>Erina-sama is impressive.</i>

168
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,740
<i>Pressure doesn't exist in her world!</i>

169
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,310
<i>Her royal bearing...</i>

170
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,940
<i>How worthy of admiration!</i>

171
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,310
Oh, one more thing.

172
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,820
Tomorrow night, we'll play Sevens!

173
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,650
In the game of Old Maid yesterday...

174
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,820
I wasn't... feeling my best, exactly.

175
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,450
Got it?

176
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,280
Y-Yes.

177
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,910
<i>Erina-sama is impressive!</i>

178
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,160
<i>She's determined to be the victor 
in anything and everything.</i>

179
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,250
<i>How worthy of admiration!</i>

180
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,630
<i>Yukihira Souma...</i>

181
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,840
<i>I will teach you your place with my cooking.</i>

182
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:23,760
<i>I will show you what an egg dish worthy of Tohtsuki is made of.</i>

183
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,600
<i>Is a buffet like one of those all-you-can-eat places?</i>

184
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,400
<i>I have no idea what breakfast
 at a luxury hotel looks like.</i>

185
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,570
Guess I'll give this a shot.

186
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,530
If you're talking egg dishes...

187
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,240
In Japanese cuisine, it'd be dashimaki eggs.

188
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,450
With Western cuisine, 
scrambled eggs sounds about right!

189
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,300
Yum!

190
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,300
Self-Praise

191
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,300
Self-Praise

192
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,430
<i>It's delicious.</i>

193
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,680
<i>No doubt about that,</i>

194
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,060
<i>but it's not enough.</i>

195
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,520
<i>Something new for the menu, huh?</i>

196
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,230
<i>That was quite interesting...</i>

197
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,100
<i>but I'm vetoing it.</i>

198
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,900
<i>Huh?!</i>

199
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,480
<i>Why, Dad?!</i>

200
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,740
<i>You thought it was good!</i>

201
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,150
<i>Listen up, Souma.</i>

202
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,450
<i>We're a diner.</i>

203
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:26,910
<i>Our customers come to Yukihira
 because they're looking for diner food.</i>

204
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:32,120
<i>Making off-the-wall dishes simply because you can won't win anyone over.</i>

205
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,090
<i>Trying to dazzle them with something novel isn't going to work.</i>

206
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,550
<i>I need to make something that's both classic </i>and<i> classy enough to be served here. But also...</i>

207
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:43,590
<i>An innovative dish that will make a vibrant contribution to the breakfast table.</i>

208
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,810
<i>There's got to be some kind of twist to
 the dish, something fresh and unexpected.</i>

209
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,430
<i>I've got it!</i>

210
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,600
I'm done!

211
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:54,730
This breakfast is a culmination 
of the Aldinis' expertise!

212
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,440
Just you wait, Yukihira!

213
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,070
Wait till you see my ultimate dish!

214
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,780
Just go to sleep if you're done, Bro.

215
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,370
<i>What should I do?</i>

216
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,030
<i>What should I do?!</i>

217
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,700
<i>I have to decide on a menu!</i>

218
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,160
<i>Just make your own food, Tadokoro.</i>

219
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,790
<i>That's enough.</i>

220
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,750
<i>Your cooking reflects your hospitality.</i>

221
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,460
<i>Hm...</i>

222
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,300
<i>Not everyone can stand to eat
 a lot of food during breakfast,</i>

223
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,720
<i>so maybe I should go with something on the lighter side.</i>

224
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,470
Something lighter...

225
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,930
Right! I get it now!

226
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:37,980
Hey, you!

227
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,690
What?!

228
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,200
Okay, I think I have a clear idea
 of what I want to do now.

229
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,960
Better start testing right away—

230
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,000
Whoa!

231
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Who are you?

232
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,920
Hm...

233
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,300
Looks like you'll make a pretty good dish.

234
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,310
Huh?

235
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,260
Oh, yeah.

236
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,260
Thanks.

237
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,930
<i>Who is she?</i>

238
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,310
<i>Her skin and hair are snow white.</i>

239
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,730
Tomorrow morning will be quite the show.

240
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,390
Good evening—

241
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,020
Ow!

242
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,200
Come on!

243
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,950
Don't just stand there! Get out of the way!

244
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,660
But you told me to stand here, Miss.

245
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,120
I <i>also</i> told you to only do that when I'm trying to intimidate someone!

246
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,460
When you stand off to the side looking like you're ready to pounce,

247
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,670
my intimidation factor goes way, way up!

248
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,290
Hey!

249
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,590
Where'd they go?

250
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,800
Where are your balls?

251
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,090
I forgot them somewhere.

252
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,590
I can't believe this!

253
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,560
They add a lot to the intimidation factor too!

254
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,760
You're so absentminded!

255
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,310
Oh, I'm sorry.

256
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,890
What were we talking about?

257
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:00,190
Oh, we weren't really talking at all.

258
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,320
So you know what you're making already?

259
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,570
Pretty much.

260
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,780
Good luck on your recipe testing.

261
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,950
Later.

262
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,120
What was that about?

263
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,450
That was Yukihira Souma-kun.

264
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,990
Despite all the rumors,

265
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,830
he doesn't seem to be anything special.

266
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,960
I can't believe he's planning to make <i>that</i>.

267
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,210
He must really want to fail this test.

268
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,480
Whoa!

269
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,350
This place is huge!

270
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,980
Hey, wake up!

271
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,270
Sorry.

272
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,610
<i>Oh, Tadokoro's here.</i>

273
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,480
<i>She's writing the "man" character again.</i>

274
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,440
<i>Takumi's here too?</i>

275
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,610
Yukihira!

276
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,910
Looks like he's saying something,
 but I can't make it out from this distance.

277
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,910
I'll win this time for sure!

278
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,370
Okay, so this is my spot.

279
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,290
Oh.

280
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,160
Hm?

281
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,500
Nakiri! Guess we're right next to each other.

282
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,670
Y-Yukihira-kun?!

283
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,420
We sure run into each other a lot!

284
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,960
<i>Why does he keep popping up everywhere?!</i>

285
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,260
<i>It's bad for my heart.</i>

286
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,590
This will be the first time I get to see you cook.

287
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,100
<i>Well, it's a golden opportunity to show him how superior I am to him.</i>

288
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,350
Yes, feel free to savor the gap
 between my cooking and yours.

289
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,440
Huh?

290
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,150
You want to compare our dishes?

291
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,770
Sure, but after the test's over, okay?

292
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,520
N-No!

293
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,110
That's not what I meant!

294
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,030
<i>My sarcasm went right over his head!</i>

295
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,410
Well, let's do our best.

296
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,290
It looks like you're planning to
 make some kind of soufflé.

297
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:37,740
Yup!

298
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,540
It's going to be a kind of omelette.

299
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,380
I'll whip the egg whites into a
 meringue before cooking the dish,

300
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,130
so the omelette will have a unique texture.

301
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,880
That's the soufflé omelette.

302
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:55,100
An novel texture is one of the surprises a dish can spring, y'know?

303
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,970
What?

304
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,600
No, nothing.

305
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,100
<i>Texture, huh.</i>

306
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,320
Each of you is ready to present your dish, I assume?

307
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,280
I will now explain the conditions for passing the test.

308
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,400
First, let me introduce the judges.

309
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,580
K-Kids?!

310
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,660
These are the people who grow and produce ingredients for Tohtsuki Resort Hotels.

311
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,170
Their families are present as well.

312
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,500
Every year, they serve as judges at this camp.

313
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,710
I've informed them that the theme is an inspired egg dish.

314
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,460
S-So many.

315
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,470
Their judging is quite accurate.

316
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,800
A hearty thanks to all!

317
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,560
<i>You may assume that I won't even touch anything poorly made.</i>

318
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,770
These guys know their shit!

319
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,820
They're way too intimidating!

320
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,240
So scary!

321
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,870
Tohtsuki Resort's kitchen and service staff will also join the judging team.

322
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,040
The steward of the service department!

323
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,670
Even Chef Doujima's right-hand chef is here!

324
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,000
There are two judging criteria.

325
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:15,180
One is whether your dish displays inspiration worthy of acknowledgment by professional producers and staff.

326
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:21,210
The other is to have 200 servings of your dish consumed in the next two hours.

327
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,680
200 servings, huh?

328
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,400
<i>I see.</i>

329
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,440
<i>There is a wide range of diners:
men and women, young and old.</i>

330
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,150
<i>They intend to simulate an actual hotel breakfast.</i>

331
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,860
<i>This challenge closely mirrors a real-life situation.</i>

332
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,620
Those who fulfill those two criteria will pass the test!

333
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:45,540
Very well, honored judges, please enjoy the breakfast in all of the exam halls.

334
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,460
May the judging begin!

335
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,130
Here it is!

336
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,210
Welcome!

337
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,500
Here you go!

338
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,090
Please enjoy!

339
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,720
Oh, how fragrant.

340
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,760
What is this?

341
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,090
It's a frittata.

342
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,720
I see, an Italian egg dish.

343
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,850
It's made with cheese.

344
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,140
As far as breakfast goes,
 it might be a bit boring.

345
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,390
Not at all.

346
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,610
I'll be serving my frittata to you as a salad.

347
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,690
I'll break the frittata into pieces,

348
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,110
and toss them with vegetables!

349
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:21,830
Then I sprinkle some balsamic vinaigrette and Parmesan cheese on top.

350
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,160
And it's done.

351
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,250
I present to you the insalata frittata.

352
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,410
"Insalata"?

353
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,920
That's Italian for "salad", right?

354
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,550
Wow! It's delicious!

355
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:40,260
The texture of the fluffy eggs
 and the crisp raw vegetables!

356
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:44,470
And the light balsamic vinaigrette
 ties it all together!

357
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,140
Amazing!

358
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,060
I've never eaten a salad like this!

359
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,060
Grazie!

360
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,190
U-Um...

361
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,530
P-Please have some if you'd like.

362
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,110
It's single-bite breakfast oden!

363
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,080
What? Oden for breakfast?

364
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,330
Hm...

365
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:08,790
And on top of that, this is
 a quail egg on the skewer!

366
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,290
Hm, I see.

367
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,750
Chicken eggs aren't the only eggs available.

368
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,510
That's her angle.

369
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,510
What a comforting taste!

370
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,550
The mild broth fills your mouth with every bite.

371
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,730
The vegetables were cut
 to match the quail egg's size.

372
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,730
They're so colorful that you
 can't resist picking them up!

373
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,690
Will you...

374
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,940
marry my grandson?

375
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,150
What?!

376
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,530
Uh, um...

377
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,530
What?!

378
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,950
This is cool.

379
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,330
A loco moco donburi at a buffet, huh.

380
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,210
Hm...

381
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,010
Loco moco is typically topped with gravy,

382
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,800
but here you've used a vinaigrette sauce!

383
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,140
The light acidity of the white wine vinegar

384
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,100
heightens the creamy texture of the yolk and the juiciness of the meat!

385
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,980
This is a very fortifying dish.

386
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,480
Well done!

387
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,690
Yeah!

388
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,650
<i>I was able to leverage the recipe
 I came up with in the Don RS.</i>

389
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,200
<i>And it'll be a piece of cake
 to make 200 servings of this.</i>

390
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,760
Have we met before?

391
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,610
Huh?!

392
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:26,570
You?!

393
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:27,740
Oh!

394
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,330
You were one of Erina's lackeys.

395
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,290
Funny, I haven't seen you around recently.

396
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,000
Oh, I get it.

397
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,380
Did Erina decide you weren't worthy of her?

398
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,120
Shut up!

399
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,470
I'm gonna beat the crap out of you!

400
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,590
My apologies!

401
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:44,800
Hm?

402
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,260
<i>What's with her dish?</i>

403
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,560
<i>A boiled egg, another unshelled egg,</i>

404
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,350
<i>and a raw egg on a small plate?</i>

405
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,810
<i>That's supposed to be a dish?</i>

406
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,270
<i>None of the guests are going near her booth.</i>

407
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,030
<i>What's she thinking?</i>

408
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,690
Here you go.

409
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,120
It's Eggs Benedict.

410
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,080
What beauty!

411
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,620
They're like brilliant jewels!

412
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,750
Eggs Benedict...

413
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,880
The dish consists of an English muffin
 topped with poached eggs and bacon,

414
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,430
then finished with a slightly
 acidic hollandaise sauce.

415
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,430
It's a mainstay on American breakfast menus

416
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,840
and certainly nothing one would consider new.

417
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,350
What's innovative about this item?

418
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,900
<i>The poached egg melts on your tongue 
and is perfection itself.</i>

419
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,530
<i>The hollandaise sauce has such a refined acidity.</i>

420
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,150
<i>The bacon is crisp,</i>

421
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,820
<i>and the muffin has a subtle sweetness.</i>

422
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,330
<i>The perfect harmony of all these 
flavors envelops the tongue.</i>

423
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,660
<i>No, that's not the only thing.</i>

424
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,290
<i>What is this brilliant golden powder?!</i>

425
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,090
<i>Dried mullet roe?!</i>

426
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,420
<i>She sprinkled dried mullet roe powder on the muffins?</i>

427
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,680
<i>I see. Fish roe is also a type of egg!</i>

428
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,850
<i>The refined saltiness of the roe
meshed with the chicken egg yolk</i>

429
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,770
<i>to produce this deep flavor!</i>

430
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:22,020
<i>A particular restaurant in New York
 that serves Eggs Benedict</i>

431
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,650
<i>has been praised as the "queen of breakfast."</i>

432
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,820
<i>And this dish is truly worthy of a queen.</i>

433
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,460
<i>The taste is enough to make you kneel!</i>

434
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,830
But of course.

435
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,220
Wonderful.

436
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,840
I'm melting.

437
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,840
Erina-sama...

438
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,470
Eggs Benedict-sama!

439
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,970
Nakiri Erina!

440
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,550
200 servings, complete!

441
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:16,990
She's fast!

442
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,430
But I'm right behind her!

443
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,430
What about Yukihira?!

444
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,390
<i>I'm halfway there!</i>

445
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,690
<i>What about Souma-kun?!</i>

446
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,150
<i>What's wrong?!</i>

447
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,320
<i>Yukihira?</i>

448
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,110
<i>No way!</i>

449
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,070
<i>He's still at fewer than ten servings!</i>

450
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,620
Next time on <i>Shokugeki no Souma</i>,

451
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,110
the fourteenth dish.

452
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,000
It's hell!

453
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,380
Metamorphosis.

454
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,650
I'm going to ferment.

455
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,690
I won't let anyone take
 my No. 1 spot at Polar Star!
