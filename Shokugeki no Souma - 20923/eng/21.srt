1
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:07,440
<i>What?</i>

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,400
<i>He's asleep?</i>

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,110
<i>He dozed off while sitting on a chair like that?</i>

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,830
<i>Now!</i>

5
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,120
<i>Now's the time!</i>

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,620
<i>This fragrance...</i>

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,770
Hm?

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,840
Hey, look!

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,170
Look at that pot!

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,550
It's rice!

11
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,800
He's simmering the rice
 with vegetables and spices!

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,050
Your pot...

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,100
You've added a paste of
 apples, bananas, and carrots.

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,560
The rice gains a creamy consistency,

15
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,770
similar to a risotto.

16
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:44,980
Nice one, Hayama.

17
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,310
You're spot on. I knew you'd figure it out.

18
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,820
You've got quite the nose!

19
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,780
<i>No, there's another secret.</i>

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,360
<i>He hasn't used anything special
 in his blend of spices,</i>

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,870
<i>so what's the key to this complex fragrance?</i>

22
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,830
Man, I was up all night testing recipes.

23
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:05,040
I was so focused on working out the differing smells
 that I didn't get any sleep. Whoopsie!

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,870
<i>You've got balls of steel, man.</i>

25
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,630
Well, you just wait and see.

26
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,920
My cooking's just getting started.

27
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,490
The dropout's going at it in such a boring manner.

28
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,700
Man, she's getting on my nerves.

29
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,660
Go back to the farm, you country bumpkin!

30
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,450
What did you two boys just say?

31
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,040
Say it again loud and clear, why don't ya?

32
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,790
Cut it out!

33
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,540
Just let them be.

34
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,500
C'mon, Fumio-san!

35
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,260
They were trying to get under Tadokoro's skin!

36
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,970
Never mind them. You've got 
some girls to cheer on!

37
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:22,800
A'ight.

38
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,010
Yeah, yeah.

39
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,200
Tadokoro, Yoshino, hang in there!

40
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,270
Yeah!

41
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,580
You can do it!

42
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,810
I'm finally done with the prep work.

43
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,730
I'd better hurry up and start cooking.

44
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,650
Do you know who's the biggest
 nuisance in a kitchen?

45
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,320
The klutz who's unaware of her surroundings!

46
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,490
Houjou-san, I'm so sorry!

47
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,660
I'll be more careful.

48
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,160
Hmph.

49
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,000
Houjou's finally adding in her spices!

50
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,370
She's letting the fragrance fully develop,

51
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,500
then stir-frying the eggs and rice!

52
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,420
Look over there!

53
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,130
There's something amazing going on!

54
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,800
He cut the pasta in a second.

55
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,760
What skill!

56
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,510
He took the mezzaluna, typically used for mincing,

57
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,390
and cut the dough into equal widths!

58
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,640
What's that dough his brother's holding?

59
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,060
You can't keep your eyes off either of them!

60
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,320
Tadokoro's not falling behind, either.

61
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,280
Yeah!

62
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,860
Watch her masterful work!

63
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,490
Wait, what?

64
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,870
<i>Tadokoro...</i>

65
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,370
<i>Tadokoro Megumi.</i>

66
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,170
<i>When I heard about her
 Cooking Battle with Shinomiya,</i>

67
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,500
<i>I thought she might be good
 enough to go up against men,</i>

68
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,510
<i>but she turned out to be
 as wimpy as she looks.</i>

69
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,130
Look!

70
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,510
A monkfish?!

71
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,270
She's going to cut <i>that</i> up?!

72
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,020
What's that girl doing?

73
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,560
She's preparing to butcher a monkfish.

74
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,770
I can see that.

75
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,150
Monkfish are covered by a gelatinous slime,

76
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,360
so it's difficult to break them down on a cutting board.

77
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,450
Hanging them is the traditional way to do it.

78
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,660
But...

79
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,750
She'll be cutting into the fish
 while it's free to move around.

80
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,040
which requires a high degree of skill.

81
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,000
She chose such a difficult fish to work with.

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,340
That's awfully risky of her at an event like this.

83
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,630
<i>Dig in!</i>

84
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,050
<i>Souma-kun has always had a positive attitude, no matter the situation.</i>

85
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,550
<i>He's always helped me.</i>

86
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,510
<i>He's not with me right now,</i>

87
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,480
<i>but he's fighting on his own at this very moment.</i>

88
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,190
<i>I don't know if I can do this by myself,</i>

89
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:43,650
<i>but Souma-kun, please lend me
 some of your courage today!</i>

90
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,070
<i>I learned that trick a long time ago.</i>

91
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,030
<i>When you're nervous,
 doing that can help you relax.</i>

92
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,910
<i>The only problem is that
 you can't do it by yourself.</i>

93
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,420
All right!

94
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,260
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

95
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,980
<i>I know butchering the monkfish has been a huge draw.</i>

96
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,890
<i>And I'd like to keep doing it for the customers,</i>

97
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,890
<i>but my body's just not what it used to be.</i>

98
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,550
<i>Don't push yourself too hard.</i>

99
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,480
<i>You've worked so hard for all this time.</i>

100
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,650
<i>We can just stop putting on that demonstration.</i>

101
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,240
<i>What the hell?!</i>

102
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,660
You<i> want to learn how 
to butcher a hanging monkfish?</i>

103
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,240
<i>You've got to be kidding me!</i>

104
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,370
<i>Women and children couldn't possibly master it!</i>

105
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,120
<i>P-Please teach me!</i>

106
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,870
<i>I want to help at home!</i>

107
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,790
<i>Please!</i>

108
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,830
<i>I'm begging you!</i>

109
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,670
<i>Please!</i>

110
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,780
<i>Fine.</i>

111
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,090
<i>If you promise you won't </i>ever<i> cry, I'll teach you.</i>

112
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,720
<i>But if you say even once that 
you're tired or want to rest,</i>

113
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,560
<i>that'll be the end of it, you hear?</i>

114
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,790
<i>No! You're doing it all wrong!</i>

115
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,400
<i>Don't make me repeat
 the same thing every time!</i>

116
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,320
<i>Don't you think you've had enough?</i>

117
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,490
<i>Just give it up.</i>

118
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,010
<i>Is this...</i>

119
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,050
<i>good enough...</i>

120
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,340
<i>for us to keep on doing this?</i>

121
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,470
<i>Amazing.</i>

122
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,180
<i>Megumi...</i>

123
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:36,760
<i>The monkfish butchering demo!</i>

124
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,440
Sh-She did it!

125
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,860
All by herself.

126
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,650
She broke down the monkfish!

127
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,400
<i>Just what is that girl planning to make?</i>

128
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,860
See?

129
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,120
This is her true ability!

130
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,160
It's about time you two head over to
 Hall A to cheer Ryouko and Yuuki on.

131
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,950
We're on it!

132
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,870
You can count on us!

133
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,830
<i>Yup, that's the spirit.</i>

134
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,300
<i>You're one of the Polar Star members that I, Daimidou Fumie, accepted.</i>

135
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,670
<i>All right! I'm gonna show
 everyone how amazing I am too!</i>

136
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,350
The time allotted for cooking is almost over!

137
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,850
Please put on the finishing touches, everyone!

138
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,270
Five!

139
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,230
Four!

140
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,190
Three!

141
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,150
Two!

142
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,110
One!

143
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,950
Time's up!

144
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,000
<i>Soon...</i>

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,710
<i>Very soon.</i>

146
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:49,000
<i>Arato Hisako, the moment when I'll expose you
 for the failure you are is near.</i>

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,960
<i>Erina-sama will finally smile upon me!</i>

148
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,470
Become sinister!

149
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,890
We will now enter the judging phase!

150
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,400
Here again is your host...

151
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,440
Kawashima Urara!

152
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,360
Smile!

153
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,860
So freakin' cute, Urara-chan!

154
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,740
So annoyed!

155
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,820
There are five judges here today.

156
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,120
Each judge can award up to twenty points,

157
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,080
so a dish can be awarded a
 maximum of a hundred points.

158
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,630
Only the top four scorers will
advance to the main tournament!

159
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,340
<i>Only the top four...</i>

160
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,380
Now let's ask our judges to 
evaluate the first contestant!

161
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,090
Hm.

162
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,640
Mm, delicious!

163
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,770
Kita Osaji.

164
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,480
He hosts the Kitami Gastronomy Club, which only top-notch literati

165
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,400
and financial heavyweights can join.

166
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,410
He spends his fortune on bringing
all kinds of gourmet food to his table.

167
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,410
The man over there is Andou Shingo.

168
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,910
He is a writer and essayist specializing in food culture.

169
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,420
He has closed many businesses with a stroke of his pen.

170
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:14,300
This dish is based on achari murgh,
 a traditional North Indian curry dish.

171
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:20,260
The special chaat masala has a strong acidity. It adds a wonderful fragrance.

172
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,850
On top of that, rather than the usual tandoori chicken,

173
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,230
you made it with chicken tikka instead.

174
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,850
It's boneless, so it's easy to eat with a spoon.

175
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,400
You've done your research,

176
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,480
and you've shown due consideration for the diner!

177
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,690
Not bad for a Tohtsuki student.

178
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,650
Thank you.

179
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:42,160
The scores, then, if you please!

180
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,210
What?

181
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,710
Each judge has twenty points
 and not ten, right?

182
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,790
But they were praising him so much.

183
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,300
M-My dish only got 33 points?

184
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,170
What's the meaning—

185
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,380
Who exactly do you think we are?

186
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:06,850
We encounter dishes made by
 countless professionals every day.

187
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,600
We may have said you did a good job,

188
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,860
but we meant a good job for a <i>student</i>.

189
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,520
I'd say a score of 50 points would be something to be proud of!

190
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,900
<i>I see now.</i>

191
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,160
<i>It's not just the Sendawara sisters
 who are to be feared.</i>

192
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:27,750
<i>All five of the judges have become jaded after
 partaking in all the gourmet world has to offer.</i>

193
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,370
<i>They have vast experience in food tasting.</i>

194
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,250
28 points!

195
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,830
31 points!

196
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,840
6 points!

197
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,500
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

198
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,800
<i>All of the dishes have been very refined too!</i>

199
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:42,260
<i>No one's even gotten a score in the 40's!</i>

200
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,140
The harsh scores continue to rock the arena!

201
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,640
Up next...

202
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,390
Wh-What's this stench?!

203
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,730
Where's this horrible smell coming from?!

204
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,440
Enjoy.

205
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,900
It's Sadatsuka Nao's special jet-black curry laksa!

206
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,820
Crap!

207
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,640
So nasty.

208
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,700
It's like concentrated sewage!

209
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,160
It's hell!

210
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,870
Hell on Earth is erupting right here in the arena!

211
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,500
It's difficult to imagine that a gourmet food festival is being held at this moment!

212
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,250
What a horrific scene!

213
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,420
I thought something like this might happen.

214
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,970
Good thing I came prepared with my cutting-edge gas mask.

215
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,930
Laksa...

216
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:27,680
A Southeast Asian dish known for its exceptionally slippery noodles.

217
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,430
The black color of the roux 
may be from squid ink, but...

218
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,770
This overpowering stench...

219
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,400
It couldn't be!

220
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,860
It's kusaya.

221
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,270
I knew it!

222
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:42,110
How dare you use such a thing in curry, you idiot!

223
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,740
Kusaya...

224
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,930
It's a famous dried fish from the Izu Islands.

225
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:50,120
Kusaya is made with a fish-curing brine that has been used for decades.

226
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,920
The fermented liquid is used to flavor blue-black fish such as sardines.

227
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,580
The fish are then left to dry in the sun.

228
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,290
They are very smelly.

229
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:05,130
It's something I made myself, 
using flying fish and mahi-mahi,

230
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,680
as well as my precious kusaya, which I've carefully fermented for a very long time.

231
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,760
Zero points! Zero!

232
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,930
I've eaten all kinds of delicacies, but this—

233
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,520
L-Lady Orie?

234
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,400
You can't be serious!

235
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:21,230
I am merely fulfilling my duties as the sponsor of the preliminaries.

236
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,570
<i>Eww...</i>

237
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:30,890
<i>The bitter acidity and fishiness mingle to create an odor that's like an unscrubbed toilet!</i>

238
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,590
I-It's delicious?

239
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,720
But it stinks!

240
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,220
It stinks to high heaven!

241
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,770
But still, it's somehow delicious!

242
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,100
<i>But it stinks!</i>

243
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,520
Wh-What's going on?

244
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,360
She's digging in, even while she says it stinks!

245
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,360
<i>This is not so different from using fermented shrimp paste, kapi.</i>

246
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:09,400
<i>By using kusaya, 
which is far more pungent than kapi,</i>

247
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,160
<i>she added depth to the flavor.</i>

248
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,750
<i>It also pairs very well with laksa, 
which uses fish stock.</i>

249
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:21,880
<i>The umami of all the seafood coats my entire mouth. How delicious!</i>

250
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,590
<i>The more I eat, the more this 
odor actually seems pleasant!</i>

251
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:32,250
<i>The use of coconut milk and spices like lemongrass has broadened its flavor!</i>

252
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,390
<i>By using kusaya as the main ingredient, 
she has strengthened the umami many times over!</i>

253
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,520
<i>Sadatsuka Nao's specialty is stewed dishes.</i>

254
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,780
<i>She's also well versed in the use of ingredients with strong flavor profiles, such as dried fish.</i>

255
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,450
<i>Her kitchen emanates a malicious aura</i>

256
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,740
<i>that may well make children
 cry and run for their lives.</i>

257
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,080
<i>And on several occasions,
 she has caused evacuations.</i>

258
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,120
<i>It has earned her the nickname...</i>

259
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,960
<i>"The Boiling Witch."</i>

260
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:06,590
True aesthetics won't be found in prim, pretentious cooking.

261
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,970
The essence of gourmet cooking can only be found in the pursuit of horror.

262
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,100
<i>How innovative!</i>

263
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,060
<i>It's the beginning of a new era for curry!</i>

264
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,680
<i>I hate it!</i>

265
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,640
<i>It reeks!</i>

266
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,810
<i>But I can't stop!</i>

267
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,860
<i>I've become prisoner to this smell!</i>

268
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,450
W-We have 84 points!

269
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,160
She's the first one to get over 50 points!

270
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,000
Sadatsuka did it!

271
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,370
She's in first place for now!

272
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:46,040
I hope I can serve this curry
 to Erina-sama some day.

273
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,470
All right. Now that the ventilation systems are running at full blast, we'll proceed.

274
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,720
Will the next student please present their dish?

275
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,720
I've long awaited this day,

276
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,690
the day on which I get to crush you in public,

277
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,190
Arato Hisako.

278
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,360
<i>This match has been confirmed by the
administration to be an official Cooking Battle!</i>

279
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,280
<i>Any objections to the conditions put forth?</i>

280
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,870
<i>Listen, Arato-san. If I win,</i>

281
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,370
<i>you will hand over your position as Erina-sama's secretary to me.</i>

282
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,750
<i>Of course, Sadatsuka-san.</i>

283
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,250
<i>And if </i>I<i> win,</i>

284
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,710
<i>you must never again come within 50 meters of Erina-sama!</i>

285
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,830
Standing at Erina-sama's side...

286
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:35,180
and being verbally abused by her
 is my ultimate dream!

287
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:39,810
Thinking of all these insults rolling off her God Tongue is enough to...

288
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,390
I believe that matter has long been settled.

289
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:47,270
I won the Cooking Battle.

290
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,270
Indeed.

291
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,570
It's true that ever since,

292
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,740
I have been limited to worshiping
 Erina-sama's face through binoculars

293
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,030
and sending about 30 letters every day.

294
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,990
<i>I should've included that stuff
 in the restraining order!</i>

295
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:05,620
But if I can best you in the Autumn Selection,

296
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,710
it's such a large venue that
 Erina-sama might change her mind.

297
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,710
I'm sure she'll let me stay by her side.

298
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,220
Next up is Erina-sama's secretary.

299
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,300
I'm sure she'll serve something spectacular.

300
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,550
Please enjoy.

301
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,270
The roux isn't very thick,
 and there's so much of it.

302
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,770
Is it something like a soup curry?

303
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,230
This meat is mutton.

304
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,720
Mutton has a stronger, gamier flavor than lamb.

305
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,780
I guess the spices have taken care of that gamey smell.

306
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,990
The smell!

307
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,040
My cooking has left its mark.

308
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,450
<i>This is just like a curse!</i>

309
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,000
<i>A curse upon you, Arato-san!</i>

310
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,460
Well, let's give this a try.

311
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,510
<i>What is this?!</i>

312
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,510
Andou-sensei, what's the matter?

313
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,930
Wh-What?!

314
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,810
Andou-sensei's normally such a dried-out stick of a weakling

315
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,190
that you can barely understand
 what he's mumbling!

316
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,530
I don't understand what just happened, but he's become energized.

317
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,110
He could star in a kung fu movie now!

318
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,860
This distinct fragrance...

319
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,410
Chinese angelica, Sichuan lovage, 
foxglove root, and peony root.

320
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:28,500
These four medicinal plants
 form the basis of this dish.

321
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,750
The Four Substance Decoction!

322
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,880
The Four Substance Decoction?

323
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,670
This dish has its own legend.

324
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:39,130
Supposedly, a dying traveler recovered instantly upon tasting this dish!

325
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,260
I see now!

326
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,680
Earlier, she was steeping the spices!

327
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,640
Yes, that's her specialty.

328
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:51,860
Arato Hisako is an expert in medicinal cuisine.

329
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,940
It blends food, medicine, and pharmacology.

330
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,820
Based on Eastern medicine, it seeks to
provide holistic nourishment to the body

331
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:03,830
by using steeped herbs, as well
as other natural remedies.

332
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,540
In addition to the four herbs,

333
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,880
I added kyo'o, daiuikyo, and shouikyo,

334
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,920
to create an original medicinal spice mix.

335
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:18,760
I steeped these spices for approximately
 an hour to extract their active ingredients.

336
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:24,260
Then I added vegetables and mutton and simmered them until tender.

337
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,850
Finally, I added Shaoxing wine and
coriander to heighten the fragrance.

338
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:34,730
Now that you mention it, the main components of medicinal cuisine aren't that different from curry.

339
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,190
Kyo'o is otherwise known as turmeric,

340
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,780
daiuikyo is star anise,

341
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,990
and shouikyo is fennel.

342
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,990
All three spices are essential in curry!

343
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,370
She decided to capitalize on it by
connecting medicinal cuisine with curry.

344
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,130
This is my medicinal dish:

345
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,380
the Four Substance Decoction Mutton Curry!

346
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,960
This is the real deal!

347
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,000
It's coursing through me!

348
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,380
The power of the medicinal herbs are coursing through my veins!

349
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,560
<i>So delicious!</i>

350
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,810
<i>The strong flavor of the mutton has been enhanced by the spices</i>

351
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:16,820
<i>and mellowed by the sweetness of the vegetables cooked into the roux!</i>

352
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,650
Thanks to the Four Substance Decoction,

353
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,530
I became all warmed up inside the moment I had a spoonful!

354
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,660
Yes.

355
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,830
Medicinal cuisine is said to warm
 one's organs, hearten one's spirit,

356
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,830
and completely purify both body and soul!

357
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,920
The way you maximized the fragrance and balanced the umami is beyond reproach!

358
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,710
It surpasses what a normal student could make by far!

359
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:43,050
After eating this dish, the previous dish feels like a mere crude shock to the senses.

360
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,970
I-It can't be.

361
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,560
All of the judges should've been
 bewitched by my curry.

362
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,640
This is for you.

363
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,270
Once you eat it,

364
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,150
you'll understand the difference
 between you and me!

365
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,490
<i>The murk...</i>

366
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,780
<i>The chaos...</i>

367
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,830
<i>That is the font of my cooking.</i>

368
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:17,000
<i>But now, it's all being washed away and purified!</i>

369
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,840
<i>No!</i>

370
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,630
<i>Stop!</i>

371
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,600
The Arato family has practiced
 Eastern medicine for generations.

372
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:41,100
I have converted all of that knowledge into cooking for Erina-sama,

373
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,610
who has endured a heavy
 burden since childhood.

374
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,140
That is what my medicinal
 cuisine is based upon.

375
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,370
The emperors of imperial China had
 a special physician, a dietetic doctor,

376
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,540
who served them medicinal cuisine.

377
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,750
Erina-sama is my empress.

378
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,590
Sadatsuka Nao, your cooking
 has always been self-centered.

379
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,050
You do not deserve to serve Erina-sama.

380
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,890
You are a blight. Begone.

381
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,430
Now, what will Arato Hisako's score be?

382
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,640
92 points!

383
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,350
Finally, a score in the 90's!

384
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,020
No surprise there! She's been
 acknowledged by Erina-sama as a chef!

385
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,740
She surpassed Sadatsuka's score with ease!

386
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,740
Hisako-onee-sama!

387
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,800
It's time for the long-awaited 
clash between brothers!

388
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,440
Bro...

389
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,720
I really want to beat you today.

390
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,970
I'll spar with you for a bit, little brother.

391
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,930
It's the Aldini brothers!

392
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,070
Next time on <i>Shokugeki no Souma</i>,

393
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,610
the twenty-second dish.

394
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,660
I'm gonna be number one!

395
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,610
The One Who Surpasses the Ordinary.

396
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,380
Doesn't it smell good?

397
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:39,050
Princess Erina, I will protect you!

398
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,870
Prince Hisako!
