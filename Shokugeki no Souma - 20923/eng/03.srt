1
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,700
My train's here.

2
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,620
All righty, I'd better get going.

3
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,780
Megumi, you're really leaving, huh?

4
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,770
And you've only just turned 13!

5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,300
Please don't worry about me, Gramps.

6
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,710
Yeah!

7
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,420
Megumi's cooking's the real deal around these parts!

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,300
It's good enough for Tokyo too!

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:42,390
Here, a good luck charm to help you stay focused on your studies.

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,600
Okay.

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,060
Megumi!

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,610
Megumi can be bashful, after all.

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,180
<i>Thanks, guys.</i>

14
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,900
<i>When I come back, I'll be a real chef!</i>

15
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,730
<i>I'm Tadakoro Megumi.</i>

16
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,020
<i>My high school life's just begun,</i>

17
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,740
<i>but I'm already on a knife's edge!</i>

18
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,840
Next, we will be presenting the new students with their class badges.

19
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,520
Incoming valedictorian, Nakiri Erina.

20
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,300
Here!

21
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,890
Ah, Erina-sama...

22
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,640
Exquisite as always.

23
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,760
Beautiful <i>and</i> at the top of her class.

24
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,560
She is perfection incarnate!

25
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,900
If I could go on a date with her, just once,

26
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,110
I'd die happy.

27
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,900
Idiot!

28
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,030
Watch your mouth!

29
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,150
You'll get kicked out of the academy!

30
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:40,700
Yeah.

31
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,910
She's the granddaughter of the don 
who heads the food industry mafia!

32
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,910
I know, but still...

33
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,120
We now welcome our keynote speaker:

34
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,580
the director of Tohtsuki Academy,

35
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,420
Nakiri Senzaemon-sama.

36
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,330
S-So terrifying!

37
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:06,390
The entire Academy-no, the entire
Japanese culinary world is under his thumb!

38
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,680
He's the epicurean emperor!

39
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,020
Calling him a mafia don is an understatement!

40
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,890
He's the devil!

41
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,440
The devil of cooking!

42
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,270
Greetings.

43
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,440
Congratulations on your advancement to the high school division.

44
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,990
During your three years
 in the junior high school division,

45
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,360
you attained a basic competency in cooking

46
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,620
and developed your understanding of each ingredient.

47
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,750
In addition to the cooking practicum,

48
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,750
you attended lectures on a variety of topics,

49
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,210
including culinary theory,

50
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,920
nutrition,

51
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,090
public health,

52
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,420
introductory agronomics,

53
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,800
and management.

54
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,760
Now you stand at the threshold
 of the high school division.

55
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,560
The challenges you face from now on
will not concern your skills or intellect,

56
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,150
but whether you have the mettle to survive as a culinary professional.

57
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,400
99 percent of you...

58
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,150
are meant to be sacrifices for honing...

59
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,950
the remaining 1 percent!

60
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,370
He called them sacrifices!

61
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,620
He's built up quite a head of steam, Bro.

62
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,410
Yeah, you're right.

63
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,000
Of the 812 students who entered our high school division last year,

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
only 76 advanced to the second year!

65
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,980
Incompetence and mediocrity will be mercilessly excised from our student body.

66
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,800
A thousand first-years will be whittled down to a hundred by next year,

67
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,640
and we can count those who will graduate from this academy on one hand.

68
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,820
One of that small handful of professionals will be...

69
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,400
will be you!

70
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,450
Hone yourself.

71
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,380
That is all.

72
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,170
All right!

73
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,260
I'm going to make it.

74
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:14,240
<i>This academy's name holds so much weight because of the intense competition,</i>

75
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,180
<i>allowing only a select few to complete their education.</i>

76
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,600
<i>Should one succeed in advancing to graduation,</i>

77
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,980
<i>their stardom in the culinary world is guaranteed.</i>

78
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,690
<i>But I pity all of those who are of my generation.</i>

79
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,950
<i>Since the moment you were born, you were destined to fight over second place.</i>

80
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:36,950
<i>The pinnacle of Tohtsuki Academy and of the Japanese culinary world</i>

81
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,420
<i>belongs to me, Nakiri Erina.</i>

82
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,420
Finally, we'd like to introduce a transfer student who will be joining your ranks today.

83
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,100
<i>So one student managed to pass a different exam?</i>

84
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,290
<i>Yukihira Souma.</i>

85
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,560
<i>Go away!</i>

86
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,480
<i>Stay away, I say!</i>

87
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,730
<i>Hmph!</i>

88
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,980
<i>The mere memory of it makes my blood boil.</i>

89
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,900
<i>But never mind all that.</i>

90
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,150
Oh, sorry to be talking to y'all from up here.

91
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,150
<i>I'll never have to see him again.</i>

92
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,240
Just be quick about it, please.

93
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,620
Okay, I'll keep it short.

94
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,830
Just a few words from me.

95
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,170
Uh, I'm Yukihira Souma.

96
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,080
To be honest,

97
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,130
this academy's just a stepping stone to me.

98
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,090
I wasn't expecting to transfer here,

99
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,990
but I don't plan on losing to folks
 who've never served a single customer.

100
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,180
Anyway, what I'm getting at is...

101
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,470
I just want to make it clear that

102
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,060
the number one spot is mine!

103
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,320
Looking forward to being with y'all
 for the next three years!

104
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,440
You little...

105
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,320
Hey!

106
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,440
I'm gonna kill you!

107
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,240
Die!

108
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,070
Get back here!

109
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,580
Phew, got through that without stumbling.

110
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,170
Hey! You're the one from the exam!

111
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,840
Uh, Nakiri, right?

112
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,960
Man, that was nerve-racking.

113
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,300
I've never had to stand in front of a bunch of people to get an award or anything.

114
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,380
What did you think?

115
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,750
Was I weird?

116
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,800
Who cares about that?!

117
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,060
Yukihira-kun.

118
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,470
Why are <i>you</i> here?!

119
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,390
Huh? What do you mean?

120
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,900
Wouldn't <i>you</i> come if you got an acceptance letter?

121
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,270
Impossible!

122
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,610
Man, you had me scared out of my wits.

123
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,940
You told me it was disgusting.

124
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,610
If you thought it was good,
 you should've just said so.

125
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,940
No!

126
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,160
<i>This is all wrong! All wrong!</i>

127
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,200
<i>I</i> rejected<i> him!</i>

128
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,330
<i>What is it?</i>

129
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,580
<i>Is it delicious or disgusting?</i>

130
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,030
<i>It's disgusting!</i>

131
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,540
<i>What?!</i>

132
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,760
I'll say one thing.

133
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,760
I haven't accepted you.

134
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,180
Neither you nor your cooking.

135
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
This is a mistake! A mistake, okay?

136
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,310
You're here at Tohtsuki
 because someone made a mistake.

137
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,140
The number one spot is yours?

138
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,230
Don't make me laugh.

139
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:11,070
Every student here has been studying
cutting-edge gastronomy for all of junior high.

140
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,280
I can already tell that an underdog transfer student like you...

141
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,990
doesn't stand a chance against them!

142
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,840
All three years of junior high, huh?

143
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,450
What about it?

144
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,170
I was three years <i>old</i> when I held a kitchen knife for the first time.

145
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,340
I've been practically living in the kitchen for the past twelve years.

146
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,930
You thought I'd let you drag my 
restaurant's name through the mud?

147
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,640
That I'd slink away, tail tucked,
after you said my cooking's disgusting?

148
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,770
Just you wait!

149
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:47,560
I'll make you say "delicious."

150
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,150
I'll use everything I've got in my cooking arsenal!

151
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,750
That transfer student sure was something!

152
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,380
Maybe that's exactly the attitude you need in order to survive at this academy.

153
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,550
You might be right!

154
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,700
Let's give it our best shot!

155
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,430
Right, Megumi?

156
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,180
Huh?

157
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,990
Where's Megumi?

158
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:21,930
Huh?

159
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,540
<i>I want out already.</i>

160
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,390
<i>I'm definitely going to be the first one sacrificed.</i>

161
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,440
<i>I got the lowest passing score on the entrance exam,</i>

162
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,650
<i>and I've already received a final notice.</i>

163
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,200
<i>No, I can't give up!</i>

164
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,910
<i>I have to live up to the expectations
 of everyone back home!</i>

165
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,330
<i>Anyway, I'm on the brink of getting expelled,</i>

166
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:52,590
<i>so I should keep my head down and not draw
 unwanted attention like that transfer student did!</i>

167
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,000
<i>Yeah!</i>

168
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,550
<i>I'm not going anywhere near that guy!</i>

169
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,510
You'll be divided into different classes and starting your coursework right off the bat.

170
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,470
Today, you'll be cooking in pairs.

171
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,560
Got it?

172
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,230
Nice to meet you.

173
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,390
<i>Why?!</i>

174
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,990
Y-u-m.

175
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,370
Oh, man...

176
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,790
The last time I had to cook during a class was home economics.

177
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,500
Hey, look.

178
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,290
Yeah.

179
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,880
It's the transfer student who was running his mouth off at the opening ceremony.

180
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,170
That guy's all talk.

181
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,890
So... Tadokoro-san, was it?

182
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,390
Why are you doing that weird little ritual like your life depends on it?

183
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:51,390
Oh! I-I'm doing this to calm down.

184
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,020
Calm down?

185
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,730
Why?

186
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:02,280
If I get even one more E rating, I'll be expelled.

187
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,450
Huh.

188
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,200
I was told that this is an elite school,

189
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,670
but even here there are people like you, huh?

190
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,540
<i>And here I thought I could survive
 by keeping a low profile.</i>

191
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,050
<i>Now I'm paired up with this guy, of all people.</i>

192
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,840
Oh, I'm Yukihira Souma.

193
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,800
Souma's fine, though.

194
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,340
Nice to meet you!

195
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,090
Oh...

196
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,760
Nice to... meet you too.

197
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,130
<i>Th-The stares hurt.</i>

198
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,980
<i>I wonder if he's even noticed.</i>

199
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,440
Attention!

200
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,150
Good morning, my young <i>apprenti</i>.

201
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,780
Good morning.

202
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,860
A-Apple Dannon tea?

203
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,570
That's Roland Chapelle-sensei.

204
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:53,540
You become responsible for creating a delectable dish
 the moment you step into the kitchen.

205
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:58,000
Neither experience nor status can excuse you from this duty.

206
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:03,720
In my class, any dish that fails to deserve an A rating
 will automatically receive an E rating.

207
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,180
Remember that.

208
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,600
<i>I've got the worst luck.</i>

209
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,390
<i>I can't believe my very first class
 is with Chapelle, of all people.</i>

210
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,480
Teach sure looks scary.

211
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,860
He's notorious for being really strict with grades, even for this school.

212
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,880
Last year, he gave E ratings
 to all 50 students in his class,

213
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,820
which resulted in 18 of them being expelled.

214
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,830
His nickname is "The Chef Who Never Smiles."

215
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,500
Huh.

216
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,580
Today's menu item is boeuf à la Bourguignonne.

217
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,380
It has been said to be a staple of French cuisine,

218
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,260
but I'll put the recipe up on the whiteboard, anyway.

219
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,970
You have two hours.

220
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,680
Each team should serve the dish as soon as it's complete.

221
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,140
Let us begin.

222
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,850
Start cooking!

223
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,350
Did he just say to add diced cucumbers?

224
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,360
<i>I just have to get through this.</i>

225
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,360
<i>Stay calm and nail each step.</i>

226
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,530
<i>Besides, Souma-kun seemed pretty confident too.</i>

227
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,280
<i>I bet his cooking skills aren't too shabby-</i>

228
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,980
Boeuf bour-what?

229
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,390
What?!

230
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,820
Souma-kun, you've never made it before?!

231
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,540
Nope, I haven't.

232
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,880
It's basically like braised beef sinew, right?

233
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,760
Well, I'm sure we'll manage.

234
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,510
I'll go take a look at the recipe.

235
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,590
<i>I guess I'm screwed after all.</i>

236
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,900
<i>Sauté the mushrooms in butter
 before adding them to the pot.</i>

237
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,570
<i>Then you just simmer everything at low heat.</i>

238
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,910
<i>Take the beef out in 40 minutes...</i>

239
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,370
<i>Take the beef out in 39 minutes.</i>

240
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,830
<i>Take the beef out in 38 minutes!</i>

241
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,170
Tadokoro, look!

242
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,340
Look at all of these spices!

243
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,680
I feel like an idiot for getting
 all anxious by myself.

244
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,560
Oh, I should probably go get a serving dish in the meantime.

245
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,070
Huh?

246
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,280
Tadokoro, did you lift the lid?

247
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,450
Huh? No.

248
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,200
It has to be simmered for 20 more minutes.

249
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,000
Wh-What's all this white stuff?!

250
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:51,680
It's salt.

251
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,550
How?!

252
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,050
Wh-What are we going to do?!

253
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,640
We can't use this meat anymore!

254
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,620
We'll have to start all over again!

255
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:05,150
But it takes more than an hour to tenderize and season the meat!

256
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:09,650
Then we have to braise the meat in the sauce for at least half an hour to let the flavors mingle.

257
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,360
We only have 30 minutes left.

258
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,980
But if we serve this salt-caked dish,

259
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,940
we'll get an E rating for sure.

260
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,220
<i>Mom...</i>

261
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,800
<i>Sorry, guys.</i>

262
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,600
<i>I'm done for.</i>

263
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,390
I got some spare ingredients.

264
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,600
Huh?

265
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,360
All right, let's put our game face on.

266
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,020
Huh?

267
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,820
What?

268
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,110
Souma-kun, there's no way
 we're gonna finish in time.

269
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,360
That teacher says some pretty good things.

270
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,240
When we're in the kitchen,
 we're chefs, not students.

271
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,330
I'm gonna serve a dish, no matter what!

272
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,040
Gimme a hand!

273
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,380
O-Okay!

274
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,180
Here's the salt, pepper, and <i>bouquet garni</i>!

275
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:15,840
Thanks!

276
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,190
Look at that loudmouth transfer
 student getting all fired up.

277
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:30,460
Whatever, there's no way
 he's getting out of an E rating.

278
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,440
Yeah.

279
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,610
Hm.

280
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,910
This is an A.

281
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:35,900
All right!

282
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,280
Next team!

283
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,990
All of the teams should be finishing up by now.

284
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,930
We've only got the sauce left.

285
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,040
Let's wrap-

286
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,840
Evaluation, please!

287
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,210
All done!

288
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,130
No way.

289
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,030
So tender...

290
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,060
The fork's practically springing back.

291
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,310
<i>What?!</i>

292
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,070
<i>Impossible! There's no way they could have braised it long enough!</i>

293
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,070
Your team had an accident, did it not?

294
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,820
How did you manage to finish the assignment?

295
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,820
We used honey!

296
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,940
I kneaded it into the meat before braising it,

297
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,560
and I also used it in the seasoning.

298
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,790
Honey has proteases, which breaks down proteins.

299
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,260
The proteases went to work on the tough beef flank,

300
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:39,220
allowing you to tenderize it
 in the short time you had left.

301
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:44,310
B-But how'd you know that 
you could use honey this way?

302
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,230
I read this cookbook a long time ago.

303
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,480
It said you could use pineapple juice to tenderize meat.

304
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,070
I couldn't think of a reason why I'd get an entire pineapple just for that,

305
00:18:55,530 --> 00:19:00,030
so I experimented with a bunch of different stuff to see if anything else had a similar effect.

306
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,400
Honey has a long shelf life.

307
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,330
It's also the most effective and easy to apply.

308
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,660
Well, you'll see once you have a bite, Tadokoro.

309
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,330
Here.

310
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,940
I'm melting.

311
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,950
Melting...

312
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,660
How marvelous!

313
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,410
Chapelle-sensei...

314
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,260
smiled!

315
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,750
Yukihira and Tadokoro.

316
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,050
I'll give you an A rating.

317
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,720
However...

318
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:09,310
I regret the fact that I do not have the authority

319
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,060
to grant you a higher rating.

320
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,520
Glad you liked it!

321
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,860
That transfer student's cooking...

322
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,650
...got a higher rating than ours?

323
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,570
H-Hey!

324
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,480
The sauce is burning!

325
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,620
Shit!

326
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,290
E rating!

327
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,800
That was an easy win, Bro.

328
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,180
Yeah, just as usual.

329
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,640
<i>If only we'd been in the same
 class as that transfer student,</i>

330
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,100
<i>we would've known how to crush him!</i>

331
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,150
Souma-kun.

332
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,900
Hey, good work back there!

333
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,780
Um...

334
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,950
Thanks for today!

335
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:07,120
It's all thanks to you that I...

336
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,910
Don't worry about it!

337
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,910
I look forward to working with you
from now on, Tadokoro!

338
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,660
Same here!

339
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:19,540
<i>Maybe I've gotten myself paired up
 with someone really special.</i>

340
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,550
By the way, want to try the new
 recipe that I came up with,

341
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,010
to celebrate our teaming up?

342
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,840
Is that okay with you?

343
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,220
I'd like to try it!

344
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,380
Here!

345
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,430
Um...

346
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,100
It's squid dipped in honey.

347
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,460
<i>The flavor of the squid had been
 taken in the wrong direction,</i>

348
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:56,040
<i>making it as disgusting as it'd feel to be
 groped all over by its tentacles.</i>

349
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,100
<i>No!</i>

350
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,690
It's Erina-sama!

351
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,520
I wonder if she's testing new recipes again.

352
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,100
I wish I could try something of hers, just once.

353
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,770
Erina-sama!

354
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,570
Erina-sama, I have terrible news.

355
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,320
What is it? Pull yourself together.

356
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,030
He received the highest rating possible in Instructor Chapelle's class.

357
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,910
By "he," I mean <i>him</i>... Yukihira Souma!

358
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:04,920
I would prefer <i>not</i> to have <i>that</i> name uttered in my presence.

359
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,380
P-Please forgive me!

360
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,470
<i>He is an abomination that has
 invaded my sacred shrine.</i>

361
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,930
<i>I cannot let him have his way!</i>

362
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,930
<i>I will purge him...</i>

363
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,730
<i>and soon!</i>

364
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,570
I have squid with peanut butter too. How about it?

365
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,150
I have so much more.

366
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:34,410
I don't like him after all!

367
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,710
Next time on <i>Shokugeki no Souma</i>,

368
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,000
the f-fourth dish:

369
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,220
The Madonna of the Polar Star.

370
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,240
Please enjoy.

371
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,010
