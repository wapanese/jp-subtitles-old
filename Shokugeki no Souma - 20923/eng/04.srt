1
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,240
<i>Damn, what is it with this school?!</i>

2
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,120
<i>It's freakishly huge!</i>

3
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,750
<i>The sun's about to set.</i>

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,210
<i>I'm exhausted.</i>

5
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,990
<i>To top it off, it's freezing!</i>

6
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,220
<i>And I'm so hungry that the squid's
 not cutting it any more.</i>

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,890
<i>Seriously, though...</i>

8
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,310
<i>Everywhere I look,</i>

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,810
<i>there's yet another pompous-looking building.</i>

10
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,770
<i>I have no idea what some of these
are supposed to be used for,</i>

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,340
<i>but there's no question that this school is rich.</i>

12
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,740
<i>I bet their facilities are all top-notch.</i>

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,360
<i>Hey, the dorm might be pretty swanky too.</i>

14
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,700
<i>Maybe I could get used to this place!</i>

15
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,980
Are you kidding me?

16
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,490
Hello?

17
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,000
Smoke?

18
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,420
Is that a fire?

19
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,750
A-And now an earthquake?

20
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:24,850
Harietta!

21
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,720
Drake!

22
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
Stagley!

23
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,360
No! Don't leave me!

24
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,400
Hey, Room 116!

25
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,180
Don't you dare keep game animals in your room!

26
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,240
If you do that again, I'll flay you alive!

27
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,570
Sorry!

28
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,450
And Room 208!

29
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,830
You turned an empty room into a smoker without my permission again, didn't you?!

30
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,830
Want me to string you up
 over some wood chips?!

31
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,560
Yeah, yeah.

32
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,130
I'm deeply sorry.

33
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,380
And Room 205!

34
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,590
If your room collapses,

35
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,880
I'll collapse <i>you</i> with a punch to the gut!

36
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,010
I-I'll try to be more careful!

37
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,660
You wanna fight?!

38
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,850
But there are two guys fighting in my room!

39
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,850
Bring it!

40
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,430
You must be Yukihira Souma, the transfer student who wants to live in this dorm.

41
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,940
I'm the caretaker, Daimidou Fumio.

42
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,940
But I'm better known as Fumio-san, the Madonna of the Polar Star.

43
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,450
As in, you'd <i>better</i> address me that way.

44
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,910
<i>How'd I get involved in </i>another<i> freak show?</i>

45
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:32,160
So what did you bring in the way of ingredients?

46
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,100
Huh?

47
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,420
What do you mean?

48
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,170
What else could I mean?!

49
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,920
Anyone who wishes to live here must pass our famous challenge!

50
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,720
First rule: dorm applicants must make one meal.

51
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,810
Only those whose cooking passes muster will be allowed to reside in the dorm.

52
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,980
Second rule: the caretaker will serve as the examiner.

53
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,980
Third rule: the applicant may bring any ingredients they wish to use.

54
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,820
This is news to me!

55
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,940
I haven't got any ingredients on me!

56
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,110
I guess that means you fail by default.

57
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,240
I won't let you cross the threshold
 without first seeing what you're made of.

58
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,950
Huh?

59
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,410
Then that means tonight I'll have to...

60
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,160
Camp outside, of course.

61
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,500
No way!

62
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,620
You can't be serious!
 Even in April, it's freezing at night!

63
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,710
I'm already half dead from exhaustion and hunger!

64
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,210
The challenge is mandatory.

65
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,170
Just forget about it.

66
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,220
The only things left in the kitchen
are scraps and leavings.

67
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,680
Consider today your unlucky dayâ€”

68
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,970
You mean I can use those leftovers?

69
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:33,850
What?

70
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,190
I'll take the challenge.

71
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,310
Where's the kitchen?

72
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,980
Oh, wow.

73
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,700
Considering what the place looks like from the outside, this is a really nice kitchen!

74
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,360
Listen up.

75
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,160
I hate know-it-all brats the most.

76
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,120
How many student-cooked meals
 do you think I've tasted in my life?

77
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:00,920
Don't you dare think I'll give you a passing grade
 for something you're going to slap together.

78
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,800
<i>Onions and other produce odds and ends.</i>

79
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,470
<i>Eggs.</i>

80
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:08,720
<i>Panko bread crumbs.</i>

81
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,520
<i>The usual assortment of spices and seasonings.</i>

82
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,970
<i>And...</i>

83
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,430
All right! This should be more than enough.

84
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,810
<i>What on earth...</i>

85
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,940
Polar Star Dormitory Caretaker
Daimidou Fumio-dono...

86
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,530
You better hang onto your seat!

87
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:48,340
There wasn't a speck of ground beef or pork left!

88
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,140
What is this magic?

89
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,100
How'd you make this meaty-looking hamburg steak?

90
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,810
I used canned mackerel.

91
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,060
It's a mackerel burger!

92
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,690
Canned mackerel?!

93
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,610
Once I prepped the eggs, onions, and panko,

94
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,820
I added them to the drained and shredded mackerel

95
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,350
and seasoned it with salt and pepper.

96
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,660
Throw that onto that stove,
 and you get a fluffy mackerel burger.

97
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,370
Then I made a simple sauce from the mackerel juice

98
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,080
by adding ponzu and thickening it with potato starch.

99
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,380
I call it "Yukihira's Kitchen-Clearing
Mackerel Hamburg Set"!

100
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,590
Have a taste!

101
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,180
Don't be ridiculous.

102
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,100
A hamburg steak made with canned mackerel...

103
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,720
would be way too fishy.

104
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,560
<i>DE!</i>

105
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,860
<i>LI!</i>

106
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,570
<i>CIOUS!</i>

107
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:55,180
<i>If he had told me that there was beef or pork in this, I might have believed him!</i>

108
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,960
<i>Yet it's still light and has an excellent mouthfeel.</i>

109
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,160
<i>But what about the egg drop soup?</i>

110
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,380
What <i>is</i> this?

111
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,680
<i>The soup base can make or break a soup.</i>

112
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,850
<i>Only a top-notch stock could have been used
to produce a soup with such a fragrant flavor.</i>

113
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,760
But how'd you come up with this?!

114
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,940
There was neither kelp nor bonito
 to prepare a soup base!

115
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,980
It turns out I <i>did</i> bring an ingredient with me.

116
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,240
Dried squid?!

117
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,950
You made a soup base with <i>dried squid</i> ?

118
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,830
Dried squid is basically umami in concentrated form.

119
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:42,800
If you reconstitute it in hot water and add salt,

120
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,380
you end up with a rich base
 that can add a depth of flavor.

121
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,510
<i>This kid's something special.</i>

122
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,180
<i>I can't believe he managed to concoct something this delicious from just those ingredients.</i>

123
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,390
<i>What a soothing flavor.</i>

124
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,340
<i>This meal warms both the body and soul.</i>

125
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,220
<i>Mackerel and squid...</i>

126
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,430
<i>This beautiful marine rhapsody of flavor...</i>

127
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,150
<i>It reminds me of my younger days.</i>

128
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,120
<i>A-Aren't you cold?</i>

129
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,040
<i>Fumio?</i>

130
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,550
<i>Hey, Kou-chan.</i>

131
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:37,260
<i>Do you know what I want you to do right now?</i>

132
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,340
<i>H-Huh?</i>

133
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,600
<i>Uh, well...</i>

134
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,270
<i>C'mon.</i>

135
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:50,110
<i>Don't make a girl say it out loud.</i>

136
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,070
<i>Come closer.</i>

137
00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:00,070
<i>I want you to warm me up.</i>

138
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,790
<i>Please.</i>

139
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,360
Take me!

140
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,220
Let go of me, old woman!

141
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,940
<i>He made me try so many of his creations
 that I'm exhausted from reacting to all of them.</i>

142
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,650
<i>You're an idiot, Souma-kun!</i>

143
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,570
<i>You treated me like your plaything.</i>

144
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,120
Right, Ducky?

145
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,000
You'd be in a pickle too.

146
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,090
Very well!

147
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,460
I will allow you to live in this dorm!

148
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,300
Glad you liked it!

149
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,390
You'll be in Room 303.

150
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,040
Here.

151
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,100
All right!

152
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,600
<i>He demonstrated an impressive flexibility with a limited array of ingredients.</i>

153
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,560
<i>Yukihira Souma will make
an interesting addition to this dorm.</i>

154
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:19,780
This has been the only sanctuary
 I've had since junior high.

155
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,680
Fumio-san's kind of scary,

156
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,450
but at least there are no strict 
teachers or Souma-kun here.

157
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,240
A bath!

158
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,620
First I'll have a hot bath!

159
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,840
Oh, I guess I forgot to warn him.

160
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,310
It's the girls' turn to use the bath right now.

161
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:50,020
Waaaah

162
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:50,020
Waaaah

163
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,900
Ah, that hit the spot.

164
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:11,250
<i>That's right. I've left my home
 of 15 years for the first time.</i>

165
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,080
<i>Here's your liver and garlic chives.</i>

166
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,960
<i>Could I get the pork and tofu set?</i>

167
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,590
<i>I'll have today's special.</i>

168
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,170
<i>Got it.</i>

169
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,670
<i>One pork and tofu, one special!</i>

170
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,800
It's so quiet.

171
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,600
Hey, transfer student!

172
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,060
C'mon, we're having a welcome party.

173
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,730
I told you already,

174
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,400
I'm busy studying for the written exam!

175
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,860
Go have your fun somewhere else!

176
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,330
Why do you guys always insist on partying here?!

177
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,040
What choice do we have?

178
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,330
You have the biggest room.

179
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,460
Who said you could sit on my bed?!

180
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,630
Your room's always clean too.

181
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,630
I just finished cleaning up!

182
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,090
Yeah, there were books scattered about earlier.

183
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,550
That's because you two were on a rampage!

184
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,550
Anyway, you should get some more chairs.

185
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,090
Like hell I should!

186
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,560
Whoops.

187
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,680
Not the books again!

188
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,580
<i>Listen, Megumi.</i>

189
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,730
<i>A proper lady mustn't show
 off her skin to just anyone...</i>

190
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,270
<i>Anyone...</i>

191
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,360
<i>Sorry, Mom.</i>

192
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,780
<i>I can't get married anymore.</i>

193
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:28,820
Well, who knew we'd end up in the same dorm?

194
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,200
Uh-huh.

195
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,040
Wait, does that mean you passed the dorm entrance challenge on the first try?

196
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,500
I guess.

197
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,460
I'm glad I managed to figure something out.

198
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,000
That's amazing.

199
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,710
Almost no one makes it through
 on their first attempt.

200
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,470
Really? How'd you do, then?

201
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,970
W-Well...

202
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,550
So-so, I guess.

203
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:54,730
<i>I'd die before I tell him that it took me three months!</i>

204
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,520
Here, Yukihira-kun.

205
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,690
Oh, thanks.

206
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,030
Huh?

207
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,940
<i>Why is it cloudy?</i>

208
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,700
<i>A 1.8 liter bottle with a handwritten label on it.</i>

209
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,740
Don't worry, it's just rice juice.

210
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,870
Oh?

211
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,260
Still, are you sure we're not going to get in trouble for partying this late at night?

212
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,480
It's fine.

213
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,270
The dorm's in the middle of a forest.

214
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,340
Well, but...

215
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,600
What about the dorm mother?

216
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,800
Hey, guys!

217
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,970
I have some buri daikon!

218
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,600
Someone come and get it!

219
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,890
Yeah!

220
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,470
I love that hag!

221
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,560
Seriously?

222
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:40,940
Just come back before Fumio-san
 starts her spiel about the Elite Ten.

223
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,440
<i>The Elite Ten?</i>

224
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,400
<i>How dare you!</i>

225
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,160
<i>Do you know who she is?!</i>

226
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,110
<i>Who is she?</i>

227
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,240
<i>She is the top of her junior high class</i>

228
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,320
<i>and the youngest member </i>ever<i> of the Elite Ten Council,</i>

229
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,870
<i>the highest decision-making body in the academy:</i>

230
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,330
<i>Nakiri Erina-sama!</i>

231
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,040
<i>The Elite Ten...</i>

232
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,210
Hey, what's this "Elite Ten" thing?

233
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,620
Huh? Seriously, you don't know about it?

234
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:13,100
You really showed up here without a clue, huh?

235
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,720
Tell him, Marui.

236
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,020
Why me?

237
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,560
Quit whining.

238
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,810
It's for the newbie's sake.

239
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,440
Fine.

240
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,030
The Tohtsuki Elite Ten Council

241
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:31,200
is a committee composed of the ten 
highest-ranking students within the academy.

242
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,920
Students are allowed to manage many of the academy's affairs,

243
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,710
so a wide variety of issues are settled by the Council.

244
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,790
They are, in effect, the academy's highest decision-making body.

245
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,960
In the academy's hierarchy, they are second only to the director himself,

246
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,430
and not even the instructors
 can oppose their decisions.

247
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,760
Decades ago, back when this dorm was always full,

248
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,770
a bunch of Elite Ten members were from Polar Star.

249
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:03,930
There were even years when
all of the Ten were from Polar Star.

250
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:08,060
Once Fumio-san gets going about
those times, it's hard to get her to stop.

251
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,280
Huh.

252
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,700
<i>So Nakiri Erina is currently one of the Elite Ten.</i>

253
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,200
We're back!

254
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,450
Hi there, Yukihira Souma-kun.

255
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,830
Welcome to Polar Star Dormitory.

256
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,080
We're glad to have you.

257
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,330
I'm Isshiki, a second-year.

258
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,790
Call me Isshiki-senpai.

259
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:29,840
Hi.

260
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,930
I'm so happy to have you join us.

261
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:38,050
It means we have yet another comrade with whom to share our youth.

262
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,850
There's nothing better in life!

263
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,730
Listen, friends!

264
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,810
We all live under the same roof
 and eat the same food.

265
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,020
That's youth right there!

266
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,230
The epitome of student life!

267
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,190
I joined the dorm because I aspired to that kind of life.

268
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:56,120
Now, let us savor our time together
in this wonderful dorm!

269
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,490
Well, that's nice and all,

270
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,840
but would you please quit coming through the attic whenever you want to see us?

271
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,710
Oh, I shouldn't do that?

272
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,670
Well, maybe I'll use this for the guys too.

273
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,590
Tadokoro-chan comes over whenever
 I talk to her through this.

274
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,700
W-Well...

275
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,630
Tadokoro-chan, are you asleep?

276
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,160
I'm having a lot of fun.

277
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,430
Well, I'm all by myself,

278
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,940
but I have lots of wonderful food.

279
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,580
If you're still awake, come on over, okay?

280
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,610
If I don't go,

281
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:33,070
he keeps talking to me every couple of minutes.

282
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,990
He gives up eventually if you ignore him.

283
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,490
You're so conscientious.

284
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,410
It'd be annoying to have him
 talking at us all the time.

285
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,370
Maybe the attic's better after all.

286
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:46,640
It seems like this dorm's full of weirdos.

287
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,380
You'll fit in right away, Souma-kun.

288
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,630
Everyone have their drinks?

289
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,590
Here's to the future of Yukihira Souma-kun

290
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,630
and the glory of Polar Star Dormitory.

291
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,050
Cheers!

292
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,100
Cheers!

293
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,680
Wow, this rice juice sure is awesome!

294
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,780
See, I told you.

295
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:20,200
Born again, right here and now!

296
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,790
Fly beyond the sky we only dreamed of!

297
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,710
Food!

298
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,250
We need more food!

299
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,000
Okay, how about something I smoked today?

300
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,460
Smoked cheese and three kinds of jerky.

301
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,720
Damn, check out this smoky savoriness!

302
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,180
Ibusaki always nails it!

303
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,430
But of course.

304
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,350
Here, eat up!

305
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:48,390
Fried mixed veggies, fresh from the garden out back!

306
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,350
There's no way this wouldn't be good!

307
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,910
It's tasty, right?

308
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,270
Of course it is!

309
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,780
Well, the fried shrimp I made last week was better.

310
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,150
Hey, wait a minute.

311
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,740
You must have the worst palate in all of Polar Star.

312
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,240
What did you say?

313
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,540
Hey, not again!

314
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,000
If you call yourself a chef,
 talk through your cooking.

315
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,500
Fine! Give me eight minutes!

316
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,880
Hey!

317
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,210
This is why you keep making
 too much food every time!

318
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,880
You two need to chill out!

319
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,840
Shut up, game animal bitch!

320
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,680
You stink of wild game!

321
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,340
That goes double for your room!

322
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,220
Now that you've said that,

323
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,060
I'll have to school you on
 the charms of my wild beasties.

324
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,940
Be back in an hour.

325
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,520
Are you going to strangle a duck
 or something at this hour?

326
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,900
Yuuki-chan, calm down!

327
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,150
Hey, hang on.

328
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,950
How about one of my own
 new creations from today?

329
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,030
Oh, Yukihira, bring it on!

330
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,330
Oh, sorry.

331
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,870
That one was no good.

332
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,710
Disgusting!

333
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,130
Sorry, sorry.

334
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,630
He's going to die!

335
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:03,720
There we go!

336
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,350
It's Isshiki-senpai's impromptu naked apron getup!

337
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,810
Nice job!

338
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,280
Times may change, but two things remain constant:

339
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,990
the laughter of students...

340
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:30,580
and the gathering of stars beneath the moon.

341
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:19,440
Tonight was quite enjoyable.

342
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,150
Again, we're very happy
to have you here, Souma-kun.

343
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,570
Well, I...

344
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,650
Thank you.

345
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,290
Looks like we're all out of food.

346
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,530
I have some filleted Spanish mackerel.

347
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,450
I'll go make something.

348
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,000
You're really gonna cook dressed like that?

349
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,440
Okay, all done.

350
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,790
Dig in.

351
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,260
It's peppered mackerel, dressed with a spring cabbage purÃ©e.

352
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,330
Thanks!

353
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,420
<i>It's heavenly!</i>

354
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,350
<i>This dish makes the most of
the seasonal ingredients of spring.</i>

355
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:32,180
<i>How could he put together such a delicate dish in so little time?</i>

356
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,720
<i>He's head and shoulders above all the other students in this dorm.</i>

357
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,720
<i>And he's just a second-year!</i>

358
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,730
<i>Is that enough time to learn how to
make something like this?</i>

359
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,690
By the way, Souma-kun.

360
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:48,990
I heard you said some pretty interesting things at the opening ceremony.

361
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,990
Gunning for number one at Tohtsuki

362
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:56,450
may not be as easy as you think.

363
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,910
Allow me to re-introduce myself.

364
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,210
I am one of the Tohtsuki Elite Ten:

365
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,800
the seventh seat,

366
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,760
Isshiki Satoshi.

367
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,300
Now...

368
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,270
I'd like to try <i>your</i> cooking, Souma-kun.

369
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:30,490
Show me the story you'll create on your plate.

370
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:43,290
Next time on <i>Shokugeki no Souma</i>,

371
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,250
the fifth dish:

372
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,000
The Ice Queen and the Spring Storm.

373
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,010
Bon appÃ©tit.

374
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,830
Take me!
