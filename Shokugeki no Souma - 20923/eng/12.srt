1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,520
Tadokoro Megumi.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,060
You will be the master chef.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,730
Yukihira, you'll be the sous-chef supporting her.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,190
What?!

5
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,150
Let the Cooking Battle...

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,820
begin!

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,780
Chou farci.

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,950
The Magician of Légumes!

9
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,870
All right. Tadokoro, 
Yukihira, serve your dish.

10
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:23,540
'Kay.

11
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,040
O-Okay.

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,220
Hm!

13
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,010
This is...

14
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,010
It's a terrine!

15
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,010
This is a Rainbow Terrine, 
featuring seven vegetables.

16
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,430
Ah, seven patés, each of a different color.

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,810
The vibrant stripes come
 together to form a rainbow.

18
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,820
Didn't Shinomiya assign a terrine
 during his sessions?

19
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,390
Fascinating.

20
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:59,950
Is this supposed to be some sort of commentary on my recette for the Terrine of Nine Vegetables?

21
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,770
N-Not at all!

22
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,960
I just wanted people to see my own recette, so...

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,090
That aside, let's see how it turned out.

24
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:11,920
Yes.

25
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,150
<i>Tadokoro Megumi.</i>

26
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,070
<i>E rating!</i>

27
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,440
<i>Why is she still here?</i>

28
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,360
<i>She's dragging Tohtsuki's name through the mud.</i>

29
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,160
<i>She's always ranked at the bottom.</i>

30
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,620
<i>She has no talent to speak of.</i>

31
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,330
<i>Go back to the boonies already.</i>

32
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,330
<i>Tadokoro Megumi.</i>

33
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,540
<i>You're fired.</i>

34
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,710
<i>Yukihira,</i>

35
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,540
<i>if you lose, you'll be expelled right along with her.</i>

36
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,990
Delicious!

37
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,910
Indeed!

38
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,830
Yeah!

39
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,160
She incorporated potatoes, carrots, zucchinis,
and other vegetables to create seven colorful layers.

40
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,130
Each vegetable was prepared in a way that would best bring out its flavor.

41
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,220
I'm impressed she managed to pull off
something so labor-intensive in so little time.

42
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,840
There are two kinds of sauce.

43
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,220
One is a sweet-and-sour sudachi gelée.

44
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,730
The other is an astringent green sauce made from a paste of several different herbs,

45
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,200
with perilla as the main component.

46
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,880
Pairing a terrine with sudachi and perilla—

47
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,820
now <i>that's</i> innovative.

48
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,400
Mmm!

49
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,830
The combination of sautéed zucchini with this herb sauce is so refreshing. It's fantastic!

50
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,000
And the sudachi complements the
lingering sweetness of the tomatoes.

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,540
I see!

52
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,480
With seven patés and two kinds of sauce,

53
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,390
you can enjoy fourteen different flavors!

54
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,960
This is very exciting.

55
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,880
Indeed.

56
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,220
These vibrant stripes contribute not only to the
visual appeal but also to the overall taste of the dish.

57
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,560
Tadokoro-kun, you used 
sun-dried tomatoes, didn't you?

58
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,020
Y-Yes!

59
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,400
Back home, we dry vegetables
 harvested during the summer

60
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,440
so that we can eat them in the winter.

61
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:07,410
I learned how to use the oven to dry them from Mo—
I mean, my mother while helping out.

62
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,660
When you sprinkle rock salt
 on halved cherry tomatoes

63
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,370
and slow-roast them in an oven
 at a low temperature,

64
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,630
they become sweeter, 
and their flavor is greatly enhanced.

65
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,670
I thought they'd accent the terrine quite nicely.

66
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,210
Indeed.

67
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:26,470
Tomatoes contain glutamic acid, an umami compound.

68
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,840
The glutamic acid is concentrated as the tomatoes dry,

69
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,680
intensifying the savoriness perceived by the tongue.

70
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:39,150
Shinomiya's Terrine of Nine Vegetables is a dish that showcases the essence of fresh vegetables.

71
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,860
In contrast, this recette focuses on flavors unique to vegetables prepared for preservation.

72
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,860
While they are both vegetable terrines,

73
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,910
one highlights the taste of freshness, 
and the other the umami born of maturation.

74
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,370
They approach the nature of vegetables from completely different angles.

75
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,120
The taste just sinks into your heart.

76
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,130
This dish is full of Megumi-chan's kindness.

77
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,590
Yes.

78
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,680
If Shinomiya-san is the Magician of Légumes,

79
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,590
Megumi-chan would be someone who
 sneakily provides us with nature's bounty,

80
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,100
a Koropokkur of Légumes.

81
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,850
No way, that's wrong!

82
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,690
Megumi-chan is someone
 who brings me happiness!

83
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,150
She's the Household Guardian of Légumes!

84
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,900
Stare...

85
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,320
Rather than that,

86
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,570
she is someone who has come from the snow country to deliver us this bounty.

87
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,280
A Snow Child of Légumes.

88
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,030
Here!

89
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,380
It's not even winter right now!

90
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,660
That doesn't suit her at all!

91
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,980
Koropokkur should be fine.

92
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,660
She's definitely a Household Guardian!

93
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,420
I still think she's a Snow Child.

94
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,920
Why did you all pick some kind
 of supernatural creature?

95
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,510
Koropokkur!

96
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,370
Household Guardian!

97
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:45,930
Snow Child!

98
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,880
We're doing ghost stories now?

99
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,590
<i>It can't be.</i>

100
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,430
<i>After all of my failures,
 I had no confidence in myself.</i>

101
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,510
<i>I was the loser of the academy.</i>

102
00:06:54,510 --> 00:07:00,350
<i>But these alumni, people whom I've looked up to for forever, say my cooking is delicious!</i>

103
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,700
All right, let's move on to judging.

104
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,530
This coin represents one vote.

105
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,240
Each of the three judges have one coin.

106
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,670
Shinomiya or Tadokoro-kun.

107
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,710
Cast your vote for the dish
 that you felt tasted the best.

108
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,550
Well, I'll go first.

109
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:33,010
<i>For the longest time, the only thing I could think about was not getting kicked out.</i>

110
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,520
<i>But now I find myself wanting to do more than that, to </i>stay<i> at this school.</i>

111
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,520
<i>I feel I've finally discovered my own cooking.</i>

112
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,980
<i>Please...</i>

113
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,780
<i>I don't want things to end just yet.</i>

114
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,280
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

115
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,570
<i>Well, who knew we'd end up in the same dorm?</i>

116
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,620
<i>A'ight! Let's go, Tadokoro!</i>

117
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,500
<i>I want to stay in this academy.</i>

118
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,620
<i>Souma-kun, why don't you go and get some rest?</i>

119
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,540
<i>Souma-kun's amazing!</i>

120
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,630
<i>Thank goodness! I'm with you again, Souma-kun!</i>

121
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,590
<i>Glad you enjoyed it!</i>

122
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,540
<i>I want to cook a whole lot more.</i>

123
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,600
<i>With everyone... With Souma-kun!</i>

124
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,390
<i>So please, God!</i>

125
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,330
My condolences.

126
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,960
The gap between the two of you was obvious.

127
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,550
Shinomiya won by a landslide.

128
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,550
<i>I... failed.</i>

129
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,220
I'm sorry, Tadokoro.

130
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,620
I couldn't help you.

131
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,640
But you can stand up straight and proud.

132
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,960
You made a really good dish.

133
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,440
<i>No! You're wrong.</i>

134
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,400
<i>It wasn't your fault.</i>

135
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,240
<i>Don't worry about it!</i>

136
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,070
<i>I look forward to working
with you from now on, Tadokoro!</i>

137
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,160
<i>I'm counting on you, Tadokoro!</i>

138
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,030
<i>Let's do this, Tadokoro!</i>

139
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,040
<i>Who do you think I am?</i>

140
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,170
<i>I was holding the fort as the number two chef at Yukihira Diner!</i>

141
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,750
<i>And now, because of me, 
even Souma-kun is...</i>

142
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,420
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

143
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,550
<i>It was my own decision, 
so you don't need to apologize.</i>

144
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,720
<i>The only problem is that 
you can't do it by yourself.</i>

145
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,480
<i>I'll give you everything I've got,
experience and all, to support you.</i>

146
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,480
<i>I'm so sorry!</i>

147
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,110
There's no need to be depressed.

148
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,620
It was inevitable.

149
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,080
Anyway, I have an early start tomorrow,

150
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,580
so please excuse me.

151
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,410
A good night to you all.

152
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,710
I believe the outcome has been decided.

153
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,220
What is the meaning of this?

154
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,680
Oh, it's nothing.

155
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,600
I simply wished to acknowledge this dish,

156
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,230
and so I cast my vote accordingly.

157
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,100
What?

158
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,960
You're not even one of the judges.

159
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,940
What're you trying to pull?

160
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,720
And why would you want to "acknowledge" that dish of hers in the first place?

161
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,820
I don't get you, Doujima-san.

162
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,570
Really? You don't?

163
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,870
The dish Tadokoro-kun made...

164
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,160
That's where you'll find your answer.

165
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,710
Shinomiya.

166
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,040
You're in a rut, aren't you?

167
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,800
What?

168
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,900
Shinomiya-senpai, you're so cool!

169
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,700
<i>Hinako, I know how you feel,
 but please stop crying.</i>

170
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,450
<i>We have to see him off with a smile.</i>

171
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,820
<i>But...</i>

172
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,540
<i>I can't believe he's going straight 
to France after graduation.</i>

173
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,620
<i>He didn't tell me.</i>

174
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,750
<i>Yeah, I was surprised too.</i>

175
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,330
<i>But you're serious about this.</i>

176
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,540
<i>Yeah.</i>

177
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,670
<i>My cooking won't be perfected until 
I hone it where French cuisine was born.</i>

178
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,290
<i>I'll train in France, open my own restaurant,</i>

179
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,880
<i>and win the Pluspol award!</i>

180
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,970
<i>The Pluspol award?</i>

181
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,310
<i>If you pull it off, you'd be the first
Japanese person to succeed.</i>

182
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,790
<i>I bet you can do it.</i>

183
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,730
<i>But, Senpai!</i>

184
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,310
<i>You won't make any friends
 because you're so aloof!</i>

185
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,690
<i>You'll definitely get into fights with the staff—</i>

186
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,480
<i>I agree with her.</i>

187
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,650
<i>You guys!</i>

188
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,700
<i>A Japanese native, 
opening a restaurant in France.</i>

189
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,120
<i>It is a thorny path full of unimaginable challenges.</i>

190
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:11,540
<i>I used the money I'd won in various cooking contests as a student</i>

191
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,620
<i>to go to France.</i>

192
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,080
<i>And after six years of training,</i>

193
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,340
<i>I opened my own restaurant, SHINO'S, in the 8th arrondissement of Paris,</i>

194
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:22,930
<i>where countless famous restaurants battle for survival.</i>

195
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,680
<i>I'm impressed that you're an owner-chef at your age.</i>

196
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,770
<i>Your cooking was magnificent.</i>

197
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,560
<i>Thank you.</i>

198
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,520
<i>I may have gotten cocky because of the restaurant.</i>

199
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,400
<i>That Japonais...</i>

200
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,730
<i>I overlooked a minor flaw.</i>

201
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:40,860
<i>Hey!</i>

202
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,240
<i>Who changed my recette for the sauce?!</i>

203
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,370
<i>This is more to Parisians' tastes.</i>

204
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,950
<i>Monsieur Shinomiya's flavors 
are a bit too Oriental.</i>

205
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,710
<i>Well, not that someone who's 
Japanese would understand.</i>

206
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,420
<i>Hey, he heard that.</i>

207
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,550
<i>Rebellion sprang up against the outsider.</i>

208
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,380
<i>Jealousy toward a chef they thought was too young.</i>

209
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,590
<i>Want to eat at SHINO'S?</i>

210
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,890
<i>I haven't heard anything good about this place.</i>

211
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,600
<i>Let's go somewhere else.</i>

212
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:15,270
<i>My restaurant's business became a shambles as more and more fissures emerged.</i>

213
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,730
<i>If you can't pay up soon,</i>

214
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,820
<i>we'll have to terminate our contract!</i>

215
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:26,450
<i>Is my ambition going to end here, of all places?</i>

216
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,040
<i>I don't need half-wits in my kitchen.</i>

217
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,450
<i>Get out of my sight!</i>

218
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,710
<i>The only one I can trust is myself.</i>

219
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,960
<i>I must think of even the staff as my enemy.</i>

220
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,080
<i>Throw it out.</i>

221
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,980
<i>Follow the recette to the letter and use the miroir glaze at the end.</i>

222
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,420
<i>I won't tolerate any deviations.</i>

223
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,180
<i>Pardon me for saying so, Chef,</i>

224
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,840
<i>but this step would be more than adequate.</i>

225
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,290
<i>We'd save on costs and increase efficiency—</i>

226
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,600
I <i>am the chef.</i>

227
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,930
<i>If you're dissatisfied, leave.</i>

228
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,890
<i>O-Oui, Chef.</i>

229
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,810
<i>I was on a knife's edge.</i>

230
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,610
<i>Delicious!</i>

231
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,170
<i>A knife's edge.</i>

232
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,910
<i>I feel the handling of the vegetables
presents certain Japanese elements.</i>

233
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,160
<i>Yet the dishes don't stray from
the traditions of French cuisine!</i>

234
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,490
<i>It is sheer magic!</i>

235
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,870
<i>He's a magician!</i>

236
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,460
<i>The Magician of Légumes!</i>

237
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,460
<i>I stayed balanced on the knife's edge.</i>

238
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,380
<i>That's how I got here.</i>

239
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,430
You must have realized it yourself.

240
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,220
After you earned the Pluspol award,

241
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,390
you had no more goals to aim for,
 nothing else to strive for.

242
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,900
You made you way to the pinnacle,
 but you haven't taken a step forward since.

243
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,900
For chefs, stagnation is akin to regression.

244
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,860
You didn't cook your specialty in this match

245
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:53,870
because you didn't want us to find out that your cooking has hit a wall.

246
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,740
Shut up!

247
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,830
What would you know about any of this?!

248
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:00,040
You're a hired chef for the Tohtsuki Group!

249
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,290
You know nothing!

250
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,330
Try it.

251
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,090
Try Tadokoro-kun's dish.

252
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,210
Why would I do that?

253
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,220
Just do it.

254
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,310
The heating was insufficient.

255
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,610
The plating and the patés' textures 
are subpar as well.

256
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,230
Doujima-san, you've lost your touch.

257
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:35,830
<i>And yet...</i>

258
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,700
<i>And yet, why does</i>

259
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:41,250
<i>this dish speaks to the heart so much?</i>

260
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,210
<i>Yes, it's clumsy.</i>

261
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,590
<i>But each detail speaks 
to the chef's care for the customer.</i>

262
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,050
<i>It's as though the dish unravels 
your tightly wound heart.</i>

263
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,550
<i>This taste, it's as though...</i>

264
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,890
<i>Kojirou.</i>

265
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,560
<i>You got yourself in another fight?</i>

266
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,400
<i>You and those friends of yours
got into another tiff, didn'tcha?</i>

267
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,110
<i>Hmph! Whatever!</i>

268
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,700
<i>I'm fine bein' by myself!</i>

269
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,210
<i>Don't care no how if no one gets me!</i>

270
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,040
<i>I know, I know.</i>

271
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,410
<i>You've got a strong set of beliefs, don'tcha, boy?</i>

272
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,830
<i>You're easily misunderstood.</i>

273
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,380
<i>Momma knows you're a gentle boy at heart.</i>

274
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,180
<i>M-Momma...</i>

275
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,260
<i>Tell you what. I'll make you
 your favorite for supper.</i>

276
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,100
<i>Let's get home and start it.</i>

277
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,810
<i>'Kay.</i>

278
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,020
<i>Look, a rainbow.</i>

279
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,810
<i>Ain't it pretty, Kojirou?</i>

280
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:46,560
<i>Yup.</i>

281
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,610
<i>I'm glad!</i>

282
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,690
<i>Yeah.</i>

283
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:54,820
<i>This taste is like a mother's love.</i>

284
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,900
Hey, half-wit.

285
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,880
Y-Yes?!

286
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,840
The spice you used in the paté...

287
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,180
It's allspice, isn't it?

288
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,260
U-Um, yes.

289
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:21,010
I believe she used it to neutralize
 the pungent odor of the chicken liver.

290
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:27,020
Allspice possesses hints of cinnamon, 
clove, and nutmeg in its flavor profile.

291
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,860
But there was another reason 
you used it, wasn't there?

292
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,190
Um, well...

293
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,820
Y-Yes.

294
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:37,860
You've all been eating a lot of food from all the judging you've been doing since yesterday.

295
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,830
That's why, well...

296
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,750
Allspice aids in digestion, so...

297
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:50,040
I-I wanted to serve you something that'd be gentle on your stomach.

298
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,260
I knew Megumi-chan was great!

299
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,630
Yes, it seems we have a good eye for people.

300
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,290
You only say that because she's your type.

301
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,010
That's not true, Mizuhara-senpai!

302
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,020
It may be clumsy, but it speaks to you.

303
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,310
That's the kind of dish it is.

304
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,350
Even in a competition,

305
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,980
Tadokoro-kun tried to be considerate toward the people who'd be eating her dish.

306
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,860
That's something to keep in mind while you're searching for the path beyond the pinnacle.

307
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,910
<i>So this was all part of Doujima-san's plan.</i>

308
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,080
<i>I see.</i>

309
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,200
<i>For a very long time,</i>

310
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,250
<i>I've been turning a blind eye 
to my customers and my staff</i>

311
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,590
<i>and cooking by myself.</i>

312
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,790
Boom!

313
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,710
There.

314
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,050
Now the number of votes is equal.

315
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,340
That means it's a tie!

316
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,350
I'll take charge of this match.

317
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,180
Hm.

318
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:48,730
If it's a draw, it means Tadokoro-kun's standing 
is the same as before the Cooking Battle, meaning...

319
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,360
This has all been very irregular.

320
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,440
What a farce.

321
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:04,160
Well, work hard so you can survive
 to see the next day.

322
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,120
That's how a half-wit can get by.

323
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,540
<i>Yukihira Souma, huh.</i>

324
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,170
What a poor sport!

325
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:20,050
S-Sorry!

326
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,050
Huh?

327
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,720
Um...

328
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,680
Uh...

329
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,680
Tadokoro-kun.

330
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:32,600
Your cooking reflects your stance toward providing a warm welcome to your guests— your hospitality!

331
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:37,570
Continue to hone that valuable
edge while at Tohtsuki.

332
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:42,280
Consider these three coins to be an investment towards your future.

333
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,830
I guess we made it out alive.

334
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,660
Congrats, Tadokoro.

335
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,850
So Shinomiya hit a wall
 because of his overly keen wit.

336
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:07,470
Yes.

337
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,980
He was so focused on getting to the top

338
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,060
that he cast off everything
 he felt was extraneous.

339
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:19,530
He reached the top before he had matured as an owner-chef.

340
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,820
But for a chef to keep striving 
for higher achievement,

341
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:28,620
it is imperative that they possess
a hunger to learn everything they can.

342
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,330
Now Shinomiya will regain that hunger.

343
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,750
In the end, this Cooking Battle saved <i>two</i> chefs.

344
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,050
You're quite the educator, Doujima-san.

345
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,050
You give me too much credit.

346
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,430
Hey, it's totally dark out.

347
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:52,100
I've so many missed calls 
from Yuuki-chan and everyone!

348
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,100
There wasn't any signal in the basement.

349
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,440
Hurry back and show them you're okay.

350
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,940
I'll take my sweet time, though.

351
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,690
Okay!

352
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,860
Oh, Souma-kun!

353
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,780
Thank you so much.

354
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,740
I'll never forget this!

355
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,330
Everyone's worried about you.

356
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,080
Just go.

357
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,000
Okay.

358
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,470
I lost.

359
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:32,930
I lost...

360
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,310
I lost.

361
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,310
Dammit.

362
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:46,240
<i>Yukihira Souma was the only one there who was fighting for a win.</i>

363
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,120
<i>That is another quality a chef needs.</i>

364
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,750
<i>Just like what Shinomiya had 
in his younger days when he left,</i>

365
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,710
<i>vowing to win the award.</i>

366
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,220
I'm back—

367
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,930
Yukihira!

368
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:39,980
You're so reckless!

369
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,190
We were so worried!

370
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,060
We heard you'd challenged an alumnus

371
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,190
and thought both of you would get expelled!

372
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,190
Calm down, Yuuki!

373
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,990
If Souma-kun hadn't been there
 for me, I would've failed.

374
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,700
Oh, right.

375
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,910
Um...

376
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,280
Ryouko!

377
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,280
Don't wipe your tears and snot on me!

378
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,910
But I'm really glad that you're both okay.

379
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,920
Don't leave us hanging like that.

380
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,290
We get exhausted worrying about you.

381
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,380
Yukihira, what happened to your right hand?

382
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,760
Are you okay?

383
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,260
Oh...

384
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,690
It's nothing.

385
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,140
Yukihira!

386
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,230
You're alive!

387
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,120
You bastard!

388
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,980
Yeah!

389
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,440
Let's start a card game tournament tonight!

390
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,610
Huh?! Right now?!

391
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,950
Why're you guys always in my room?

392
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,490
Yeah!

393
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,040
Next time on <i>Shokugeki no Souma</i>,

394
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,960
the thirteenth dish:

395
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,650
Try them.

396
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,610
Go for a complete collection.
