1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,940
3 Years Ago in Florence, Tuscany, Italy

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,940
3 Years Ago in Florence, Tuscany, Italy

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,200
<i>Buon appetito.</i>

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,450
<i>You've become even better than before, Takumi.</i>

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,830
<i>With Isami at your side, Aldini is in good hands.</i>

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,420
<i>Takumi, will you go out with me?</i>

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,800
<i>Looking good as usual, Takumi.</i>

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,630
<i>Why don't we have some fun?</i>

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,840
<i>Takumi, want to learn how to have a good time?</i>

10
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,970
<i>Si, grazie.</i>

11
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,230
<i>I appreciate the thought,</i>

12
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,140
<i>but there's something I have to do.</i>

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,020
<i>Are you sure you can afford
 to let both of them go, Bro?</i>

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,360
<i>Yes. Even as their father, 
I can see that they're great chefs,</i>

15
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,160
<i>but there is a certain something that Takumi lacks.</i>

16
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,420
<i>A culinary school in Japan?</i>

17
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,090
<i>I don't get it, Uncle.</i>

18
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,250
<i>What's the point in us attending a place like that?</i>

19
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,470
<i>We've been working here at Aldini
 for eight years already.</i>

20
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,720
<i>Well, there's no harm in giving it a try.</i>

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,930
<i>The school's top-notch and world-famous.</i>

22
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:23,930
<i>You can leave the restaurant in my brother's-
I mean, your father's hands.</i>

23
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,190
<i>Focus on being the best chefs you can be.</i>

24
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,980
<i>We'd be transferring into 
the second year of junior high.</i>

25
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,320
<i>What do you think, Isami?</i>

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,650
<i>I'll go if you do.</i>

27
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,410
<i>Takumi will surpass me in a few years.</i>

28
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,080
<i>But he doesn't have a goal beyond that.</i>

29
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,880
<i>What he needs right now is a worthy rival.</i>

30
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,050
<i>There's no way I can lose to any chef my age.</i>

31
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,510
<i>I'm a professional who has fought on the front lines.</i>

32
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,270
<i>I wasn't expecting to transfer here,</i>

33
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,800
<i>but I don't plan on losing to folks 
who've never served a single customer.</i>

34
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,980
<i>Anyway, what I'm getting at is...</i>

35
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,270
<i>I just want to make it clear that</i>

36
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,820
<i>the number one spot is mine!</i>

37
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,950
Mezzaluna.

38
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,790
Tritare!

39
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,550
Tre...

40
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,680
Duo...

41
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,180
Uno...

42
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,850
Fine!

43
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,560
You've introduced core elements of Japanese cuisine

44
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,810
into both the duck and the salsa verde,

45
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,320
pulling it all together into 
an exquisite Japanese dish.

46
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,230
Takumi Aldini and Isami Aldini,

47
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,150
you have passed my test.

48
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,490
Grazie!

49
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,070
<i>They're way too fast!</i>

50
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,080
<i>They had to dress the duck too.</i>

51
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,910
<i>I can't believe they didn't even take an hour!</i>

52
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,250
Well, Yukihira Souma?

53
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,670
You don't seem to have made much headway.

54
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,800
What are you going to prepare for us?

55
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,170
I see.

56
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,470
You said you were competing with each other.

57
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,220
Very well.

58
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,970
If I can expect a dish that will be on par with what I just tasted,

59
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,730
I will make an exception and judge which of your dishes is better.

60
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,150
Did you hear that, Yukihira?

61
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,770
Sure! Let's do this!

62
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,070
Good. Whoever loses must kneel.

63
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,650
Huh?

64
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,490
Kneel before the victor,

65
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,280
and say "I am a loser" three times.

66
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,240
If you're staking the reputation of your restaurants,

67
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,700
then the penalty for losing 
must be at least that heavy.

68
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,630
Oh, but <i>you</i> don't have to kneel,

69
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,670
Tadokoro Megumi-san.

70
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,000
You have such beautiful hands.

71
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,880
<i>Sh-She really scares me!</i>

72
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:29,100
Anyway, I dare you to make 
a dish that surpasses ours!

73
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,810
<i>These two made no assumptions coming into this.</i>

74
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,310
<i>They decided on a duck dish</i>

75
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,730
<i>and assembled an impressive list
of ingredients that would enhance it.</i>

76
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,900
<i>Think.</i>

77
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,200
<i>What's the best possible dish
 I can make, here and now?</i>

78
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,080
<i>Use the ingredients there</i>

79
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,580
<i>to make a dish that could serve as
a main course in Japanese cuisine.</i>

80
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,130
<i>There were chickens and rabbits too.</i>

81
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,260
Tadokoro.

82
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:06,800
Yes?

83
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,680
I'd like to use these ingredients 
for the accompaniment.

84
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,760
I want you to gather them.

85
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,640
Think you can find all of this?

86
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,470
Um, yeah.

87
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,840
I think I can do it!

88
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,230
I often foraged for mountain
 vegetables back home.

89
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,010
Great.

90
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,150
I'm counting on you, Tadokoro!

91
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,730
But what will you be doing, Souma-kun?

92
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,650
There's something else I need to track down,

93
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,740
so I'm heading out again.

94
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,320
Oh, but before I do...

95
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,410
Inui-senpai.

96
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,490
You said we can use anything we find, right?

97
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,790
What?

98
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,910
Oh, yes.

99
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,960
As long as it's within the fenced-off area.

100
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,050
Then the key ingredient for our dish will be...

101
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:47,880
this!

102
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,260
Huh?

103
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:49,930
Wha—

104
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,430
That's—

105
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,930
No!

106
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,170
The snack I'm having with my tea!

107
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,640
K-Kaki rice crackers?

108
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,560
So anyway, we're going outside again.

109
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,940
Oh, can you hang onto this for me?

110
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,610
Huh?

111
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,820
Why me?

112
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,890
All right! Let's go, Tadokoro!

113
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,850
O-Okay!

114
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,780
Wait!

115
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,280
My kaki rice crackers!

116
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,120
<i>Yukihira...</i>

117
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,080
<i>What do you have up your sleeve?</i>

118
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,710
And that's the last thing on this list!

119
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:27,960
Ow!

120
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,630
Ow!

121
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,420
Damn you!

122
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,550
<i>If there are chickens running around, that means...</i>

123
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:34,760
There!

124
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,720
Yeah!

125
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,100
Freshly laid eggs!

126
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,400
This tastes terrible.

127
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,980
Try again.

128
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,360
<i>Are we ever gonna pass?</i>

129
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,830
So many have tried already,
 but only a few pairs have passed.

130
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,990
What should we do?

131
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,480
Inui Hinako.

132
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,620
An alumna of Tohtsuki's 80th graduating class.

133
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,790
In her student days, she was known
 as the Empress of Mist.

134
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,000
Everyone feared her.

135
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,720
The Empress of Mist?

136
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,930
I have no idea what that means,
 but it sounds impressive.

137
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,470
Who gave her that nickname?

138
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,770
In any event, I must say...

139
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,460
There's been <i>so</i> many grilled fish.

140
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,600
Everything has the same texture.

141
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,110
I'm in the mood for something with more bite.

142
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,400
<i>That's easy for her to say.</i>

143
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,110
<i>We're in the middle of nowhere!</i>

144
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,910
<i>What are we supposed to make?</i>

145
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,750
Oh, you're all welcome to keep 
making new dishes until time's up.

146
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,710
Sh-Shit! Let's try again!

147
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,720
It's hopeless!

148
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,210
There's no time!

149
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,040
I sure am glad we passed, Bro.

150
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,010
Why isn't Yukihira back yet?

151
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,090
He'll run out of time!

152
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,380
You should calm down.

153
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,550
If he doesn't finish in time, you'll win by default. What's the problem?

154
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,600
I want a heated battle!

155
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,230
A win by default is worthless to me!

156
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,940
<i>Besides,</i>

157
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,400
<i>this thing he just handed to me...</i>

158
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,480
<i>Just how does he intend to use it in his dish?</i>

159
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,700
Yukihira!

160
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,660
You're late.

161
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,990
You only have 15 minutes left!

162
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,040
Are you trying to get disqualified so you won't have to face me?!

163
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,370
Bro, you crushed it.

164
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,920
Ah, sorry!

165
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,340
I-It's not what it looks like, Yukihira!

166
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,750
Don't worry about it.

167
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,880
You saved me some time.

168
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,090
Thanks.

169
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,090
Speaking of time, we have a whole 15 minutes.

170
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:37,840
What?

171
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,350
If I made my customers wait 15 minutes,

172
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,180
they'd all leave.

173
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,310
Let's do this, Tadokoro!

174
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,020
Okay!

175
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,360
I saved him time?

176
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,280
<i>Prepare the mountain vegetables.</i>

177
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,320
<i>First, trim the Devil's walking sticks.</i>

178
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,740
<i>Be thorough...</i>

179
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,160
<i>Thorough...</i>

180
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,080
Once you're done, separate
the egg yolks from the egg whites.

181
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,500
Okay.

182
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,460
<i>Huh?</i>

183
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,880
<i>We're making a deep-fried dish?</i>

184
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,880
<i>Yup, fried river fish.</i>

185
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,510
<i>But we don't have flour or potato starch.</i>

186
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,590
<i>There's nothing to use as batter.</i>

187
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,010
<i>You're not going to cook 
without batter, are you?</i>

188
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,350
<i>The moisture content of river fish is too high.</i>

189
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,640
<i>Frying them won't work well.</i>

190
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,600
<i>Don't you worry. We have the perfect breading.</i>

191
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,320
<i>River fish.</i>

192
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,610
<i>Chicken eggs.</i>

193
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,950
<i>Rice crackers.</i>

194
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,700
<i>I get it now!</i>

195
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,950
<i>So that's how Yukihira's going
 to use the rice crackers!</i>

196
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,460
<i>He's going to crush them
 and use them as breading!</i>

197
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,680
All right!

198
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,100
It's done!

199
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,270
Here you go, Inui-senpai.

200
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,560
Please try it before it grows cold.

201
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,400
All right, I'll have a taste.

202
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,150
Oh, my.

203
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:21,610
My kaki rice crackers have become part of
such a lovely deep-fried dish!

204
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,000
What a wonderful texture!

205
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,960
So crunchy.

206
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,670
Yet inside, the fish is very tender.

207
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,010
Protected by the breading,

208
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,050
the fish's umami has been concentrated within.

209
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,890
And thanks to the flavor
 of the kaki rice crackers,

210
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:51,440
the breading has its own assertive taste.

211
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,270
The accompanying sauce is light as air, 
made from Japanese mayonnaise and kinome.

212
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,820
Japanese mayonnaise?

213
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,950
That's made by beating together
 vegetable oil and egg yolks, right?

214
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,280
And then they made a sauce with it?

215
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,950
He mixed chopped kinome, which are shoots of the Japanese pepper tree,

216
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,500
into the mayonnaise, along with some salt.

217
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,420
He created a refreshing flavor that cuts the oiliness of the fish,

218
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,970
making the dish more refined.

219
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,460
The creaminess that you can taste

220
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,760
between the crunchiness of the breading whets the appetite.

221
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,720
The fried mountain vegetables
 are excellent as well.

222
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,850
The visual contrast with the char is superb.

223
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,310
<i>I've assigned this task many times in the past.</i>

224
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,860
<i>I've seen some decent fried dishes without breading, 
but this is the first successful attempt </i>with<i> breading.</i>

225
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,710
<i>The kaki rice crackers are embracing the char at the peak of its season.</i>

226
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:02,260
<i>It's like a passionate embrace
 with an elegant mermaid.</i>

227
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,970
<i>No, I can't...</i>

228
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,520
<i>I'm drowning in my love of kaki rice crackers!</i>

229
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,440
Where'd you come up with this idea, Souma-kun?

230
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,530
Have you heard of something called okaki-age?

231
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,120
You deep-fry ingredients in a breading of crushed okaki crackers.

232
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,130
The crumbs are used to improve
the texture or introduce a novel flavor.

233
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,590
I've made it at home before.

234
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,550
And that inspired you to try it
with kaki rice crackers instead?

235
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,630
That's right.

236
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,140
I call it, Yukihira-style Char Okaki-A—

237
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,770
No, I call it, Yukihira-style Char O-Kaki-Age!

238
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,400
You came up with that right now, didn't you?!

239
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,610
I had that in mind all along!

240
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,020
You're just making things up as you go!

241
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,530
I haven't strayed from my path!

242
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,150
<i>Aldini-kun kept an open mind</i>

243
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,360
That was just chance.

244
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,570
It was blind luck!

245
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:09,240
<i>and did not overlook duck as a possible ingredient.</i>

246
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,240
You were just damn lucky!

247
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,620
It's actually a menu item that's pretty common at Yukihira too.

248
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:14,120
<i>On the other hand, Yukihira-kun
 drew upon his unusual creativity</i>

249
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,330
<i>to make a dish no one here could've expected.</i>

250
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,460
<i>Despite the constraints of time and circumstance, they both rose to the occasion</i>

251
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,300
<i>and made a dish that they could call their own.</i>

252
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,260
<i>That is the mindset of a true professional.</i>

253
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,720
Yukihira Souma and Tadokoro Megumi,

254
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,430
you have passed my test.

255
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,970
Glad you liked it!

256
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,640
Uh... Napolitan?

257
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,450
Wrong!

258
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,950
Okay, time's up!

259
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,410
The session is now complete.

260
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,660
Thank goodness.

261
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,960
I'm finished!

262
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,870
Shit!

263
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,670
Chef Inui.

264
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,210
Please make your decision.

265
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,930
Very well.

266
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,720
I will announce the victor.

267
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,560
The one who crafted a splendid texture for the char,

268
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,020
using an idea no one else had.

269
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,780
Wait, please give me a moment.

270
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,490
All right, I've made my decision.

271
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,280
The one who did not overlook duck as a possibility, 
despite being thrown into an unfamiliar situation,

272
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,450
and surpassed others with his choice of ingredients.

273
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,370
Well, on the other hand...

274
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,330
What are they doing?

275
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,040
A comedy skit?

276
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,050
Ugh!

277
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,420
What is it now?

278
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,270
I'm in the middle of something important—

279
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,800
What're you up to, Hinako?!

280
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,350
Your group of students should've been back a long time ago.

281
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,270
Just get your ass back here, idiot.

282
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,430
S-Sorry, Shinomiya-senpai!

283
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,060
E-Everyone, we should hurry back to the hotel!

284
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,860
Hey!

285
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,570
What's your decision, Inui-senpai?!

286
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,610
Eek!

287
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,070
Oh, right!

288
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,150
I'll...

289
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,910
have to revisit that.

290
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,410
All right, everyone on the bus!

291
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,910
<i>She kept us in suspense for so long!</i>

292
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,790
<i>She ducked out of making a choice!</i>

293
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,850
I'm not letting this go!

294
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,130
Listen up, Yukihira!

295
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,710
We'll settle this someday!

296
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,800
Sure, but how?

297
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,970
Sooner or later, I <i>will</i> challenge
 you to a Cooking Battle.

298
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,470
Don't you dare run away.

299
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,430
You'll have to accept.

300
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,660
And that's when I will crush you!

301
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:46,150
You'd do well to hone your skills before then as best you can.

302
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,110
Until we meet again, Yukihira Souma.

303
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,280
Seat yourselves as far back as you can!

304
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,530
Let's go!

305
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,490
So we meet again!

306
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,280
Shut up!

307
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,200
Don't talk to me!

308
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,440
What's the matter?

309
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,670
Aren't you gonna crush me?

310
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,790
I told you, don't talk to me!

311
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,260
<i>That test allowed me to take full advantage</i>

312
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,720
<i>of the knowledge and techniques I've cultivated over the years.</i>

313
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,340
<i>When I had the inspiration for my dish,</i>

314
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,550
<i>I was convinced that I would win.</i>

315
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,220
<i>But he held his own.</i>

316
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,520
<i>Shit.</i>

317
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,560
<i>She didn't say which dish
 she thought was better.</i>

318
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,440
<i>So why do I feel like I've lost?</i>

319
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,980
<i>This isn't over.</i>

320
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,280
<i>I </i>will<i> defeat you.</i>

321
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,200
<i>Takumi of Trattoria Aldini, huh?</i>

322
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:42,790
<i>There's someone my age who's that good.</i>

323
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,210
<i>If I had stayed holed up in Yukihira,</i>

324
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,340
<i>I never would've known about him.</i>

325
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,300
Megumi!

326
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,300
Yukihira!

327
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,720
You made it!

328
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,470
Yuuki-chan, Ryouko-chan!

329
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,350
What about the others?

330
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,690
Ibusaki-kun's checking on them right now.

331
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,730
Got it. Well done.

332
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,690
All the Polar Star members 
made it through the first day.

333
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,860
Whew!

334
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,200
Are you sure Marui made it?

335
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,580
He was running around in the mountains the whole time, apparently.

336
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,910
Oh, guess his test was similar to ours, then.

337
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,290
Man, I'm tired.

338
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,660
I can barely move.

339
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,590
Don't be ridiculous, ladies.

340
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,470
We're about to reap our rewards!

341
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,880
Rewards?

342
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,640
Dinner, bath, and hotel room!

343
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,560
I bet they'll all be extravagant and sumptuous!

344
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,690
And I'm going to enjoy all of it
 to the absolute fullest!

345
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:59,360
Those of you who finish serving them 
dinner will be allowed to have free time.

346
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,870
Who are all these people?!

347
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,870
The Jouwan University bodybuilder 
club is staying nearby.

348
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,250
The American football and wrestling clubs will be arriving soon.

349
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,300
Our dinner today consists of a steak set.

350
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,300
Each of you will prepare fifty servings.

351
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,100
Fifty servings each?!

352
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,050
Now?!

353
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,930
You've got to be kidding me!

354
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,220
But, Sekimori-senpai!

355
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,600
What about <i>our</i> dinner?

356
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,230
Once you've finished preparing
fifty servings, you can make your own.

357
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,600
Make our own?

358
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,520
But what about...

359
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,360
What about our extravagant dinners?

360
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,860
There will be no such thing.

361
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,610
You should also know that
 during your training camp,

362
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,240
you will be preparing your 
own breakfasts and dinners.

363
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,450
<i>Oh...</i>

364
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,500
<i>I can hear Yuuki's heart breaking.</i>

365
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,250
Lastly,

366
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,710
if you cannot finish serving our guests' dinner within the next sixty minutes,

367
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,460
you will be expelled on the spot.

368
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,010
Begin!

369
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,120
Hey, don't cut in line!

370
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,650
You're taking too long!

371
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,410
This, this, and this.

372
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,570
The portions aren't large enough. Start over.

373
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,010
Seconds.

374
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,410
Seconds!

375
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,120
Not full yet.

376
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,660
Ten more bowls!

377
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,740
I can't lift my arms.

378
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,830
I still have thirty servings left.

379
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,740
I can't take it anymore!

380
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,380
I'm not done yet!

381
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,170
Not done!

382
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,210
Hey, Marui.

383
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,130
Are you okay?

384
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,920
<i>This camp is hell after all.</i>

385
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,130
Food!

386
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,840
Food! Food!

387
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,390
<i>It's hell on Earth, all right!</i>

388
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,180
Yukihira Souma, fifty servings complete!

389
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,100
You pass the test!

390
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,440
Glad you liked it!

391
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,390
<i>He's so fast!</i>

392
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,090
Shit!

393
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,520
He finished before me!

394
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,910
But just wait, Yukihira!

395
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,570
Mine will taste better!

396
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,680
I think.

397
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,690
You, there!

398
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,320
Move your hands, not your mouth!

399
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,200
Yes, sir.

400
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,580
Well, I'll be in Marui's room.

401
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,160
Don't you dare!

402
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,450
I want to go to bed early tonight!

403
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,450
Hey!

404
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,040
Hurry up, four-eyes!

405
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,290
He still wants to play?

406
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,790
Yukihira sure has a lot of stamina.

407
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,550
I said I'd wait in Marui's room,

408
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,720
but I really can't do anything on my own.

409
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,220
I wonder if there's something on TV.

410
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,860
That's right!

411
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,480
I'll just take my bath before everyone else!

412
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,360
Maybe I'll have the bath all to myself!

413
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,780
I gotta go get my yukata and underwear!

414
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,690
Oops, sorry.

415
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,870
Next time on <i>Shokugeki no Souma</i>,

416
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,420
the tenth dish:

417
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,520
The Heavenly Recette.

418
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,010
It's delicious!

419
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,940
Fate is the spice of life.
