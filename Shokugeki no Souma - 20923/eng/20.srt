1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:04,770
Hm?

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,480
What's wrong, Tadokoro?

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,900
After seeing Hayama-kun
 with all his different curries...

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,030
I guess I'm feeling a little down.

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:13,450
<i>All right.</i>

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,450
There's just a little over a month till the Selection.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:26,250
How am I supposed to come up with a dish
that'll stand up to the likes of Hayama-kun?

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,380
At my family's diner,

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,880
whenever I'd get a good look
 at my dad working away,

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,050
I could tell, y'know?

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,390
That I still had so much more to learn.

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,470
But Dad still made me come up
 with new menu items.

13
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,430
I was <i>so</i> nervous.

14
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,590
After all, I was only in sixth grade.

15
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,060
I'd never be able to deal with that much pressure!

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,060
The thing is...

17
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,570
if I let that sorta stuff get to me,

18
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,280
I'd never come up with anything.

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,490
I don't have the time to be thinking about how I might fail to measure up.

20
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,910
I couldn't run away from
 my family's diner back then,

21
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,580
and I can't run away from the Selection.

22
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,040
I just have to deal with it and push on, you know?

23
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,750
Okay! Yeah!

24
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,290
Also, about the topic...

25
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,380
Spices are important, sure,

26
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,340
but I don't think they're
 the only thing that matters.

27
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,220
<i>With only six weeks until the Autumn Selection,</i>

28
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:24,060
<i>thus began the scorching summer we spent facing curry head-on.</i>

29
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,950
There are roughly forty varieties of spices that might be found in a typical curry.

30
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,960
So you have to pick out between ten and twenty of them to make a blend. Okay.

31
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,210
Some spices may cancel each other out,

32
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,840
so you can't just randomly throw some together.

33
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,590
You have to figure out whether to use whole, ground, or fresh spices,

34
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,970
which oils and cooking methods
 will maximize their flavor,

35
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,470
which roasting and maturation methods will work,

36
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,980
and whether they'll pair well with the ingredients.

37
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,310
Huh?

38
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,690
Come back!

39
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,570
Megumi!

40
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,620
<i>Spices are important, sure,</i>

41
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,960
<i>but they're not the only thing.</i>

42
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,670
Wow, what a great honor!

43
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,010
To think that one of our Don RS members would be selected as a candidate!

44
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:06,010
Use your super-high-quality meat to score a spot in the main tournament, Nikumi!

45
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,850
Then we'll rake in gobs of club funds and perks.

46
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,890
We'll attract scores of members!

47
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,770
The Don RS's future will be secured!

48
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,980
It's not that simple.

49
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,940
Simply serving good meat won't cut it.

50
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,410
I have to figure out the best combination of spices and the right meat to go with them.

51
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,200
My greatest weapon is meat dishes.

52
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,200
I'll create a curry that'll best
 take advantage of that.

53
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,040
You'd go so far for the Don RS?

54
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,000
Nikumiâ€”

55
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,210
Shut up about the Don RS already!

56
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,130
Are you sure you don't want
 to go back to Italy yet?

57
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:41,670
Yeah.

58
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,760
Mom and Dad will be sad.

59
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,050
There are plenty of regulars
 waiting for your cooking too.

60
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,270
I'm only pushing back my flight by a few days.

61
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,940
I want to think about this
 a bit longer on my own.

62
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,350
All right.

63
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,940
Then give it all you've got.

64
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,770
Try to beat me!

65
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,320
Okay.

66
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,540
But you better not cry if I win, Bro.

67
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,240
You always cried when you lost at some game.

68
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,120
Hey, that was when we were in elementary school!

69
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,870
Ugh, I'm leaving!

70
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,870
Hey, Bro!

71
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,250
Huh?

72
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,870
Do you have your passport?

73
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,750
Can you check in and board the plane on your own?

74
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,420
Use the restroom before you board.

75
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,380
Quit making fun of your brother!

76
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,590
Have a safe trip!

77
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,480
<i>Heh. I won't stand for any of that bullshit!</i>

78
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,520
<i>So what if she's the daughter of Chef Houjou?</i>

79
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,650
<i>I won't stand for no </i>woman<i> heading the kitchen!</i>

80
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,200
<i>The moment she sets foot in here,</i>

81
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,780
<i>I'll bully her right outta here!</i>

82
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,030
<i>Delicious!</i>

83
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,080
<i>It's hard to believe that a third-year
 junior high schooler could make this.</i>

84
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,040
<i>Yeah.</i>

85
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,540
<i>She's already as good as the chief, if not better.</i>

86
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,480
<i>Chief!</i>

87
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,380
<i>When I graduate from Tohtsuki in three years time, I'll be joining your kitchen.</i>

88
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,600
<i>I look forward to it, Senpai.</i>

89
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,970
<i>I'll be entering a battlefield full of formidable men.</i>

90
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:16,930
<i>I need prestige!</i>

91
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,900
<i>I need overwhelming prestige so that they
 won't dare look down on me for being a girl!</i>

92
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,320
<i>First, I'll win the Autumn Selection,</i>

93
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,990
<i>and then I'll win the first seat on the Elite Ten!</i>

94
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,280
<i>You can count on Houjou Miyoko to do just that!</i>

95
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,360
<i>Once August arrived,</i>

96
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,210
<i>Polar Star members began
 going home to visit their families.</i>

97
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,580
<i>And...</i>

98
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,880
You're going back today?

99
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,790
Yeah.

100
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,800
It's Obon season.

101
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,800
I also want to see how spices pair up 
with the local ingredients back home.

102
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:49,930
I see.

103
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,970
Good luck.

104
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,510
Thanks. You too!

105
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,850
You'll be the only first-year
 here for a while, but...

106
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,730
Well, it's not like I'll be bored.

107
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,480
See you soon.

108
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,440
Okay!

109
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,520
Bring back presents!

110
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,270
I will!

111
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,610
<i>Three weeks until the prelims.</i>

112
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,680
This is it.

113
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,970
With this flavor, I will triumph.

114
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:33,970
I'll get you this time!

115
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,970
For sure!

116
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:35,680
I can feel it!

117
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,900
Just you wait, Arato Hisako.

118
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,150
What's wrong, Hisako?

119
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,110
Oh, it's nothing.

120
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,570
I just felt a slight chill.

121
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,660
Oh, that's not good!

122
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,660
Should I turn down the air conditioner?

123
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,080
E-Erina-sama, you don't need to worry about me.

124
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,910
Then do you need anything else?

125
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,790
No, it's enough that you're
 allowing me to use your kitchen.

126
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,870
What about tea?

127
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,600
Should I make you some tea?

128
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,540
No, um...

129
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,210
Really, please don't worry about me.

130
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:14,300
Oh my, Erina's bored out of her skull
 because she's not competing in the prelims.

131
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,550
Looks that way.

132
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,280
Well, I've basically figured out what I'll make,

133
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,600
so I'm bored too.

134
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,020
Um, Miss.

135
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,530
I'd like to work on my curry too.

136
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,650
No way! You have to entertain me!

137
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,620
Hey!

138
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,870
It's you, Megumi!

139
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,620
Hi, everyone!

140
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,950
It's been a while!

141
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,340
We heard all about it!

142
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,130
You got picked for a super-big contest!

143
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,710
You're our pride and joy for sure!

144
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,840
O-Oh, stop it, you guys.

145
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,130
Megumi!

146
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,510
Welcome home.

147
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,510
Mom!

148
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,970
I'm home!

149
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,100
It's been a long time since I've
 had your help in the kitchen.

150
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,350
I think you're better than ever.

151
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,870
Oh, I still have a ways to go.

152
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,780
I'm always making mistakes.

153
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,650
Even during camp, Souma-kun...

154
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:18,410
<i>What the hell? So it was only
 because you had help from a guy?</i>

155
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,900
<i>I misjudged you.</i>

156
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,620
<i>It's just like Houjou-san said.</i>

157
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,370
<i>I've always had someone helping me.</i>

158
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,170
<i>But in the prelims, I have to fight on my own.</i>

159
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,840
<i>Even I have to wonder what exactly I'm capable of.</i>

160
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,010
Souma-kun, did you pull an all-nighter?

161
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,800
Oh, Isshiki-senpai, morning.

162
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,260
That's a lot of trials you've got there.

163
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,560
This one's interesting.

164
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,190
Yes, really interesting, Souma-kun!

165
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:32,060
Oh? But I'm just getting started.

166
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,570
I'll make it even better...

167
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,330
Hayama-kun?

168
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,410
Did you pull another all-nighter?

169
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,040
Yeah.

170
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,000
It's almost done.

171
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,750
My secret weapon of a spice mix.

172
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,920
You shouldn't!

173
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,250
If you work yourself to the bone, you'll get sick!

174
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,090
Look who's talking.

175
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,090
You often pull all-nighters yourself, Jun.

176
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,390
Quit calling me Jun!

177
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,720
It's Professor Shiomi!

178
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,180
Oh, and do try to stop passing out on the floor.

179
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,810
You're pretty heavy for a runt.

180
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,520
A-And here I was all worried about you!

181
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,860
I hope you lose, Hayama-kun!

182
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,360
I won't lose.

183
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,570
I'll prove to everyone that you
 and I make an unbeatable team.

184
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,870
Sorry, Hayama-kun.

185
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,020
I forgot to water them again.

186
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,100
Are you mad?

187
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,270
I'm not mad.

188
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,900
I'm so, so sorry.

189
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,260
You must be mad.

190
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,980
I'm <i>not</i> mad.

191
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,950
Ah, I knew it! You really <i>are</i> mad!

192
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,410
This place is huge.

193
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,370
Are we really going to cook here?

194
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,550
Souma-kun!

195
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,410
Tadokoro!

196
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,000
How did your summer go?

197
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,760
It was good. I think I trained
 hard for this in my own wayâ€”

198
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,820
Megumi!

199
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,340
Long time no see!

200
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,300
You look well.

201
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,550
You too, Yukihira!

202
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,380
How've you been?

203
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,340
Well, so-so, I guess.

204
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,760
Oh, Nikumi.

205
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:27,970
H-Hey.

206
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,720
We're in the same group.

207
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,930
Let's get through this together.

208
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:31,390
To...

209
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,640
Together?!

210
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,310
Y-You idiot, we're rivals!

211
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,440
I'm not g-gonna lose to you this time!

212
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,480
S-Sure.

213
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,110
I'm disappointed I'm not in the same group as you.

214
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,900
Oh.

215
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,200
But Ryou-kun is. Have fun, you two.

216
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,620
Ryou-kun, say hello.

217
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:48,700
'Sup.

218
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,580
'S-'Sup.

219
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,290
The lingering scent of spices
 is coming from your fingers.

220
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,460
Hayama!

221
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,880
I guess you've been hard at work.

222
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
Yup.

223
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,760
I want to let you taste some really great curry.

224
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,840
Heh.

225
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,760
Yukihira!

226
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,430
Oh, Takumi.

227
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,220
It's been a while.

228
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,470
I'll... I'll say this to you now.

229
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,200
Your true rival is me right hereâ€”

230
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,560
Hey, who's the guy standing next to you?

231
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,310
Who, him?

232
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,230
It's Isami, of course.

233
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,060
Huh?

234
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,390
You're lying!

235
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,570
Wh-What's with you?

236
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,490
Isami loses some weight every year
 when the summer heat gets to him.

237
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,070
This is because of the summer heat?!

238
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,660
I feel more comfortable this way, but don't worry.

239
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:33,660
I'll be back to my old self come fall and winter.

240
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,960
S-So this happens every year?

241
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,290
I'm amazed you're still alive.

242
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,040
A-Anyway, now you know.

243
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,500
This is Isami.

244
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,050
Okay, let's start from the top.

245
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,260
Yukihira?!

246
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:47,710
Thank you for your patience, everyone!

247
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,180
Eyes on the front stage, please.

248
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,890
Hey, what's going on?

249
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,610
Oh, sorry, can this wait?

250
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,180
Huh? Hey, wait!

251
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,100
We'll be starting with a speech
 by the director of Tohtsuki Academy,

252
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,570
Nakiri Senzaemon.

253
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,280
Nakiri Senzaemon...

254
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,950
He's the old guy who made that
speech at the opening ceremony.

255
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,450
D-Director?!

256
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,710
D-Don't mind me.

257
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,210
I just choked on something.

258
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,090
When I breathe in the air here,

259
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,590
I can feel the energy coursing
 through me, body and soul.

260
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,470
He was coughing just now, though.

261
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,340
Shh!

262
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,260
This is the Hall of the Moon Gods.

263
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:38,310
Ordinarily, only the Elite Ten may use this space to challenge each other in Cooking Battles.

264
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,900
To show our respect to those
 who have won the first seat,

265
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,730
it is traditional to display their portraits.

266
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,280
Whoa!

267
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,650
He's right.

268
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,110
There's Doujima-senpai over there.

269
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,530
Shinomiya-senpai too! He was a first seat?

270
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,950
Countless unforgettable battles
 have been fought here,

271
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,700
and countless specialties have been born here.

272
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,210
That is why the memories of
 the battles fought here

273
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,590
linger in the air like a thick fog!

274
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:10,180
And this is also where the main tournament
 for the Autumn Selection will be held.

275
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,430
In other words, only students who pass the prelims...

276
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,810
Right. Only they may fight on that stage.

277
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:20,270
You will all make your marks on history today!

278
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,980
Let us meet here again,

279
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,780
chefs of the 92nd class of Tohtsuki Academy!

280
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,280
Oh right, Takumi.

281
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,490
What was it that you wanted to say earlier?

282
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,330
Forget it.

283
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,410
We'll now explain the rules for the preliminaries.

284
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,540
As indicated in our written notice,
 the theme of this stage is curry.

285
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,210
You will have three hours.

286
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,260
Out of the sixty candidates in the preliminaries,

287
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,090
eight will advance to the main tournament.

288
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,430
In other words, there will be four from each group.

289
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,020
Only that many?!

290
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,020
They'll be weeding us out real fast.

291
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,730
Candidates should proceed to their group's designated workspaces.

292
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,440
The preliminaries will begin at eleven o'clock.

293
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,240
Let's go!

294
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,860
Let's do this!

295
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,780
There's no point in getting scared!

296
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,280
Yeah.

297
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,740
Right!

298
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,740
Yukihira!

299
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,750
Let's meet again back in here...

300
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,540
at the main tournament!

301
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,580
Yup.

302
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,840
Begin cooking!

303
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,280
Welcome.

304
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,030
Surely you were informed that
 we would begin promptly at eleven?

305
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:01,040
What is the point of such questions when you know just how difficult it is

306
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,120
to free up even a minute of my schedule?

307
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,370
Well, Eizan-kun?

308
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,630
S-Sendawara Natsume!

309
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,960
She controls the curry business in Japan.

310
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,670
She's the Queen of Curry!

311
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,930
Eizan-kun talked me into coming,

312
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,010
but can mere students hope to be anything but a waste of my time?

313
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,640
Heh, just keep shelling out the big bucks to me.

314
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,060
What was that?

315
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:23,980
Oh, nothing.

316
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,900
Please enjoy the Autumn Selection
 to your heart's content,

317
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,310
Natsume-sama.

318
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,940
Eizan-senpai's amazing.

319
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,110
Only he could bring in a superstar like her.

320
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,950
Yeah. If we're getting Sendawara Natsume,

321
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,320
I bet Group B's getting...

322
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,080
Yeah, her twin, Sendawara Orie!

323
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,040
Say, Isshiki-kun,

324
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,960
when will you join our company?

325
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,460
I can't wait for you to be mine already.

326
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,590
But I'm still just a student.

327
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,590
That's no problem at all.

328
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,020
Go ahead and drop out right now.

329
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,140
You'll be set for life if you stick with me.

330
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,100
C'mon, hurry up!

331
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,060
I can't wait any longer!

332
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,900
Well, for today, please enjoy the dishes
 prepared by the cute first-years.

333
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,650
Hm, oh, very well.

334
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,460
Takumi Aldini... Is he from Italy?

335
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,870
It looks like he's making stock from beef shank and chicken bones.

336
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,410
How boring.

337
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,950
His younger brother is next to him.

338
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,910
Isami Aldini.

339
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,370
He's covered the bottom of his pot with tomatoes.

340
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:33,340
Tomatoes are a staple vegetable of Italian cuisine.

341
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,630
I'm sure he knows all about them.

342
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,350
Oh, this peculiar, insistent fragrance!

343
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:47,270
It must be from spices being sautÃ©ed in duck fat!

344
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,060
Keep it up!

345
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,770
Yoshino!

346
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,730
Oh, look over there. What is she making?

347
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,530
By all accounts, she should have
 sautÃ©ed those spices in fat,

348
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,700
but instead she poured them
 straight into water!

349
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,820
Look!

350
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,540
Nakiri Alice's doing something totally different from the rest!

351
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,960
What the hell are those giant machines?

352
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,500
A flash freezer and a centrifuge?

353
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,500
I can't imagine what kind of
 dish you'd make with those!

354
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,960
Well, the same goes for Sadatsuka Nao.

355
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,390
Her roux's pitch black!

356
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,390
That's not cooking. That's black magic!

357
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,600
Miyoko-sama!

358
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,020
Sister!

359
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,980
I feel like someone's getting
 all the attention from the guys!

360
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,690
That's the heir to Houjou-rou,

361
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,110
a famous restaurant in Yokohama's Chinatown.

362
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:44,660
Many of the spices used in Chinese cuisine can also be used in curry.

363
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,120
It'll be interesting to see 
the twist she puts on her dish!

364
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,500
It's true there are a few students who look interesting.

365
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,540
Fine, I've made up my mind.

366
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,580
Give me all the students over there.

367
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,040
G-Give?

368
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,460
You don't hold back, do you?

369
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,090
Oh, but...

370
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,920
I don't need the girl with the braids.

371
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,930
She has no flair.

372
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,640
I don't think she has much potential.

373
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,060
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure about that.

374
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,690
That girl is using Sichuan peppercorns.

375
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,940
It's a spice that can remove gaminess from meat.

376
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,280
Not to mention, she ground it coarsely, so it retains its rich fragrance.

377
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,740
Well done.

378
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,280
Nikumi...

379
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,320
You've grown so much.

380
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,590
Hey, Nikumi!

381
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,030
I'm cheering you on!

382
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,540
<i>He's like a dad watching
 his daughter at a sports festival!</i>

383
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,200
<i>J-Just ignore him!</i>

384
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,670
<i>How's everyone else doing?</i>

385
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,170
<i>Nakiri Alice's aide...</i>

386
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,130
Most of the prep work's done.

387
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:39,840
Okay.

388
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:48,680
<i>The hell?!</i>

389
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,850
<i>He's like a totally different guy!</i>

390
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,850
What extravagant movements.

391
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,190
Indeed.

392
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:59,570
In comparison, however, that one's quite dull.

393
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,820
Is that... udon?

394
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,530
<i>That'd be the one who specializes in fermented goods,</i>

395
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,620
<i>Sakaki Ryouko.</i>

396
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,820
<i>It's black?</i>

397
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,240
<i>And what on earth is that sticky substance?!</i>

398
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:15,580
<i>This prelim's strongest contender should be him.</i>

399
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,710
Fish head curry, hm.

400
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,550
By using the entire head of a whitefish,

401
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,720
you can enjoy the full flavor of the fish.

402
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,140
It's a curry dish originating in Singapore.

403
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,390
He's pairing it with naan, not rice.

404
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,230
It's less original than I'd expected.

405
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,690
That naan, could it be?

406
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,400
<i>That's right, Jun.</i>

407
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,320
<i>My cooking's just getting started!</i>

408
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,200
This fragrance...

409
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:53,040
This slight twinge of freshness amid the rich smell of coconut milk...

410
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,080
That freshness makes you hungry!

411
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,790
Despite all of the aromas in the air,

412
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,210
you can tell which one's coming from his pot.

413
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,920
It's evidence that he's blended
 his spices to perfection.

414
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:11,430
This is a different kind of fragrance.

415
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,350
It's smoke!

416
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,430
I see!

417
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:17,020
Smoking is yet another method of adding fragrance to a dish.

418
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,980
The air in this hall has changed yet again!

419
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,480
Hm.

420
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,610
Well, it seems I'll be a bit entertained.

421
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,110
So, who's your pick, Eizan-kun?

422
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,320
Hm, let me think.

423
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,490
At this point it's hard to say,

424
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,360
but there <i>is</i> a man whose
 abilities I wish to assess in full.

425
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,300
What?

426
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,720
Yukihira?

427
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,970
No way...

428
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,260
He's asleep!

429
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,310
I'm Natsume!

430
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,320
I'm Orie!

431
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,310
Next time on <i>Shokugeki no Souma</i>,

432
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,790
the twenty-first dish:

433
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:34,030
Menu

434
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:34,030
The Unknown Known

435
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,130
The Unknown Known.

436
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,330
Thrill me!

437
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,330
Be thrilled!

438
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,750
Why didn't you cut it into a bunny shape?!

439
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,680
Oh...

440
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,460
You good-for-nothing!

441
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,910
Oh...
