1
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:09,320
So? You gonna do it with me or what?

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,530
Hm?

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,280
Let's do it.

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,660
A Cooking Battle.

5
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,500
Good morning, Souma-kun.

6
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,610
I'd like your help with something.

7
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,260
Can you get dressed and come outside?

8
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,550
I'm dead tired because I was up all night.

9
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,600
Please ask someone else.

10
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,890
Oh, don't be like that.

11
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,390
<i>That's</i> where you were?!

12
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,520
He woke you up too, Yukihira?

13
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,650
Yup, same as you.

14
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,360
So what did he drag us out of bed for?

15
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,840
We're harvesting veggies from the garden out back.

16
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,240
Wow, you guys even grow your own produce?

17
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,450
"The road to good food is paved
 with good ingredients."

18
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,830
That's our dorm's motto!

19
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,010
Ibusaki prepares all of the wood 
that he uses for smoking.

20
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,490
Ryouko, who specializes in dishes using rice malt,

21
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,030
has her own work space for fermentation.

22
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:50,230
I want to create a special Polar Star chicken, like the Bresse chicken from France,

23
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,560
so I'm breeding cage-free chickens out here.

24
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,310
Really?

25
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,120
Last but not least...

26
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,240
There's a plot that we take care of,
overseen by Isshiki-senpai.

27
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,660
Here it is!

28
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,040
We grow over ten kinds of vegetables in this field!

29
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,170
Good morning, Souma-kun and Yoshino-kun!

30
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,980
Morning labor is good for the spirit!

31
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,320
Let's sweat together!

32
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
It fits him to a T!

33
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,960
Knowing how food grows
 is part of our training.

34
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,020
You could call this the Polar Star Farm,

35
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,480
or perhaps even the Isshiki Farm.

36
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,650
Uh, sure.

37
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,150
Oh, Souma-kun!

38
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,880
You're here too, Tadokoro?

39
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,840
Look!

40
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,070
Isshiki-senpai grew these vegetables.

41
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,030
Don't they look delicious?

42
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,620
Y'know, seeing you here in normal 
clothing is very soothing.

43
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,920
Yeah, Megumi's a breath of
 fresh air at Polar Star.

44
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,090
Here.

45
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,170
Why don't you try one?

46
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,670
Oh, thanks.

47
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,140
Delicious!

48
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,100
It's plump and super sweet.

49
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,020
I'd love to have these for our restaurant.

50
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,580
How'd you grow something of this caliber?

51
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,380
Oh, I spend all my time here.

52
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,690
I've been missing a lot of my classes lately.

53
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,780
<i>Don't you have your priorities backwards?</i>

54
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,740
Sorry to keep you guys waiting!

55
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,680
Whoa!

56
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,420
This is delicious too!

57
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,500
C'mon, Souma-kun, all you're doing is eating!

58
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,380
Aw, come on.

59
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,640
Breakfast time, everyone!

60
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,600
My back's killing me.

61
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,260
I'm starving!

62
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,520
Tadokoro, you made these?

63
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,640
Yeah. You must be hungry.

64
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,690
Dig right in.

65
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,230
Wow.

66
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,320
I see.

67
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,240
It's the Tadokoro-chan Special, the Rice Ball Trio.

68
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,570
Awesome, rice balls <i>would</i> hit the spot after all that fieldwork!

69
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,360
Thanks for the food!

70
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,580
So delicious!

71
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,490
There's green onions and salt in this, right?

72
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,960
You seasoned cooked chicken tenderloin with it 
and also brushed some onto the rice ball!

73
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,840
The saltiness really excites your appetite!

74
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,920
Salty foods are so appealing
 after doing manual labor.

75
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,660
This must be kelp.

76
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,340
It's a classic rice ball ingredient.

77
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,810
Kelp simmered in soy sauce and cheese?

78
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,640
Right!

79
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,730
The strong sweet flavor of the kelp pairs surprisingly well with the cheese.

80
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,730
So what's the last one?!

81
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,000
Delicious!

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,410
The garlic flavor rocks!

83
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,200
This one's pork marinated with garlic.

84
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,370
Wow!

85
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,120
After seeing you use honey in class the other day,

86
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,620
I decided to try something based on that.

87
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:05,160
I marinated boiled boneless pork rib in a mixture of garlic, miso, sake, and honey.

88
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,760
It goes really well with rice,

89
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,260
so I chopped it up and made rice balls with it!

90
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,760
Huh.

91
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,720
Oh, there's barley and roasted green tea as well.

92
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,390
Please have whichever you'd like.

93
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,530
This is the appeal of Tadokoro-chan's cooking.

94
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,810
It's comfort food that soothes everyone's souls.

95
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,720
The chicken is moist,

96
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,240
and the pork's nice and tender too.

97
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,580
Both bear the hallmarks of careful preparation.

98
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,380
So why can't you cook like this in class?

99
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,590
I've always had issues with stage fright.

100
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,800
When I get nervous, I blank out,

101
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,970
and then I fail at everything.

102
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,640
Oh, that's tough.

103
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,120
You should try to be more relaxed when you cook, Tadokoro-chan.

104
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,350
Yeah, Megumi.

105
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:02,020
You'd make a good cook <i>and</i> a good wife.

106
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,650
You think so?

107
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,220
Huh?

108
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,200
Research societies?

109
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,450
Yeah. Tohtsuki has lots of groups 
that study various foods and cuisines.

110
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:19,080
For instance, some groups 
develop new recipes after school.

111
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,420
Or they can compete in cooking 
contests outside of the academy.

112
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,170
You could say it's Tohtsuki's
 version of school clubs.

113
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,970
I'm in the Regional Cooking Research Society.

114
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,550
Huh.

115
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,390
You weren't kidding.

116
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,390
Asian and Western cuisine.

117
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,270
Imperial court and Buddhist cuisines.

118
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,890
Fermentation and preservation.

119
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,600
Oh, this one's for train bentos!

120
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,400
Huh?

121
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,820
The Donburi Research Society?

122
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,770
Maybe I'll find inspiration for our restaurant's menu.

123
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,110
All right, guess I'll go take a look.

124
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,160
Let's go, Tadokoro!

125
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,880
Huh?

126
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,320
I'm coming with you?

127
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,280
This is...

128
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,190
Sorry, but you should probably go.

129
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,880
Don RS is about to become history.

130
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,590
<i>What?!</i>

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,510
You said you're Yukihira and Tadokoro?

132
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,430
I'm Konishi, the leader of this research society.

133
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,680
You okay, Senpai?

134
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,890
You look pretty down.

135
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,690
Mock me all you want.

136
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,190
I couldn't save Don RS.

137
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,240
Are these recipe collections?

138
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,740
It's full of recipes created by Don RS.

139
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,660
Let's take a look.

140
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,160
<i>From more mainstream items to offbeat ones,</i>

141
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,620
<i>these dishes are jazzed up with a spark of creativity.</i>

142
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,130
These recipes are all interesting!

143
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,130
Why are you shutting down?

144
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,550
You understand?

145
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,510
Yukihira!

146
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,140
He's crying!

147
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,720
The don has a functional beauty that obeys the laws of speed, taste, and affordability!

148
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,330
It's so manly you can eat it completely with one arm!

149
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,730
It's food for men who fight!

150
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,860
I...

151
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,110
As a man...

152
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,990
I cannot die until I've created the ultimate don!

153
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,740
He really is something.

154
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,530
He's kind of oppressive.

155
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,830
My Don RS!

156
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,290
If only Nakiri Erina didn't exist!

157
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,620
Nakiri?

158
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,670
Right, this is how she works.

159
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,500
First, she'll propose that the council slash the budget or allotted space

160
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,010
for any group she doesn't like.

161
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,590
She coerces them into voting her way.

162
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,550
Once a group is cornered, 
it's left with only one choice:

163
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,010
the last-ditch Cooking Battle!

164
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,270
In exchange for accepting the challenge,

165
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,440
Nakiri will make even more extreme demands.

166
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,820
In the end, she'll get what she wants.

167
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,150
That is how she expands her sphere of influence.

168
00:09:55,150 --> 00:10:00,450
Once my members learned that our opponent is one of Nakiri's lackeys,

169
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,830
they all fled.

170
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,500
<i>He couldn't inspire a loyal following, huh?</i>

171
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,880
So are you facing off against Nakiri?

172
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,920
It's—

173
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,420
Hey!

174
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,930
Rather than renovating,

175
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,560
it'd be faster to raze this place
 and rebuild from scratch.

176
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,310
Yeah?

177
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,350
Then let's do that.

178
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,310
Who do you think you are, Mito?!

179
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,310
What? I'm just checking this place out.

180
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,320
I already know the outcome, after all.

181
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,490
Like Erina-sama said,

182
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,470
no matter how much effort you put into a don,

183
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,530
it's a low-class dish relegated to class B gourmet fare.

184
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:46,500
"Tohtsuki has no need for such a dish," she said.

185
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,880
Well, it's a different story
 if you think you can beat me.

186
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,290
Get it now, Mr. RS leader?

187
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,340
A club like this doesn't belong here.

188
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,140
Damn you, Nikumi.

189
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,700
My name isn't Nikumi.

190
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,350
If you ever call me that again...

191
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,480
Wait, <i>she's</i> your Cooking Battle opponent?

192
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,820
Who the hell's she?

193
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,940
She's Mito Ikumi-san,

194
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,280
also known as the Meat Master.

195
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,650
Ever since junior high, 
she's always received high ratings.

196
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:27,450
And she's <i>never</i> received anything below an A rating for meat dishes.

197
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:31,250
Her knowledge of all things meat is said to be top-notch, even within the academy.

198
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,920
All ingredients must bow before worthy meat!

199
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,470
No matter what dish you may try to create,

200
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,090
you will never beat my super high-quality meat!

201
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:49,220
I think you give cooking a bad name if all you care about is the price of your ingredients.

202
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:52,770
Senpai...

203
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:58,230
would you let me handle this Cooking Battle?

204
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,820
Who the hell are you?

205
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,610
Outsiders should butt out.

206
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,660
Wait, you're that transfer student from the opening ceremony.

207
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,290
I've been wanting to talk to you.

208
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,380
You must have a lot of confidence in your skills

209
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,090
if you're butting into someone else's Cooking Battle.

210
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:21,340
Why don't we compete on your turf with a meat dish?

211
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,050
I'll win, though.

212
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,770
Then if I win, asshole,

213
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,470
are you willing to leave Tohtsuki?

214
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,940
If you don't have the balls
 to do that, don't talk so big.

215
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,900
Sure, fine!

216
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,860
<i>What?!</i>

217
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,520
In return, if <i>I</i> win...

218
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,200
Yeah, you'll have to join Don RS.

219
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,110
Huh?

220
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,240
Huh?!

221
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,660
Join Don RS and contribute
 to advancing donburi culture.

222
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,290
Call it penance for bothering us.

223
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,040
You really think you can beat me?

224
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,300
It's quitting time for all you contractors!

225
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,720
I'll cut you some slack with the theme.

226
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,390
The main ingredient will be meat,

227
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,310
and the dish will be the don.

228
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,640
The cook-off will be in three days!

229
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,560
Why'd you do that, Yukihira?

230
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,660
Oh.

231
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,950
She kept going on about how
 pricey meat is everything,

232
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,740
and I couldn't let that pass
 because I'm a diner brat.

233
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,160
Besides, I think this club's
 too good to let it go to waste.

234
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,840
Yukihira!

235
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,160
But how are you going to beat her, Souma-kun?

236
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,580
I'll think of something.

237
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,840
<i>I knew it!</i>

238
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,800
<i>I'm grateful to Erina-sama
 for letting me handle this.</i>

239
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:50,800
<i>I'll teach that uppity transfer student
the pleasure of the flesh.</i>

240
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,430
A bit more to the right. Just a bit more.

241
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,480
A little bit more.

242
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,480
What was Yukihira thinking?!

243
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,400
Everyone in the academy's talking about it!

244
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,180
Calm down, Yuuki!

245
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,560
I'll do my best to help,

246
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,030
but there's just too little time!

247
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,990
<i>So what will you do, Souma-kun?</i>

248
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,460
Since last night,

249
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,460
I've been giving this a lot of thought.

250
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,570
Nikumi's a specialist in meat,

251
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,120
beef in particular.

252
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,220
So, I don't think we should use beef.

253
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,440
For example, maybe we could 
do a chicken-and-egg don.

254
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,970
Chicken still fits the theme.

255
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,480
We should differentiate ourselves from Nikumi as much as possible.

256
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,310
I see. An offbeat choice.

257
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,190
What kind of don do you like, Tadokoro?

258
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:49,660
Well, it's not a traditional don,
and it's not meat-based,

259
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,080
but I like taking scallops that've been lightly grilled in the shell

260
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,990
and seasoning them with a bit of butter and soy sauce.

261
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,040
They're godly on piping hot rice!

262
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,230
You're right.

263
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,480
We could've gone with a seafood don,

264
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,420
but you just had to go ahead
 and say we'd do meat.

265
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,300
It's a done deal. Quit complaining!

266
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,890
You don't know how strong Nikumi is!

267
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,140
If we get slammed with
 her A5 beef, we're done for!

268
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,270
"Eigo"?

269
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,600
English?

270
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,570
By A5 you mean the grade of beef, right?

271
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,980
Yeah, that's right.

272
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,910
The "A" is the yield grade, which is based on how much of a carcass is actually beef!

273
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,370
That ranges from A to C!

274
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,730
Then the firmness and texture of the meat,

275
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,290
the luster of the fat, and so on

276
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,540
determine the quality grade,

277
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,880
which ranges from 1 to 5!

278
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,800
Only beef that meets the highest qualifications for both grades

279
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,260
receives the A5 rating!

280
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:02,220
I've eaten one of Nikumi's steaks at an academy event.

281
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,150
At... At that level...

282
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,730
you can <i>drink</i> the meat!

283
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,070
Drink it?!

284
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:08,960
That's right!

285
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,280
The moment you bite into it,

286
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:15,280
the beef transforms into a mass of umami that glides down your throat.

287
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,840
If you were to order that
 kind of meat at any store,

288
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,680
you'd have to throw down several Benjamins.

289
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,850
And there's something else
that you have to keep in mind.

290
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,960
Any ingredient you use in a Cooking Battle...

291
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,420
you must prepare yourself.

292
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,220
Procuring ingredients is considered an essential skill for chefs!

293
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,950
The Mito family operates a large-scale meat wholesale business.

294
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,770
They have the market cornered 
when it comes to premium beef.

295
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,230
They have the finances, 
the facilities, and the distribution.

296
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:50,530
All of this lies behind Nikumi's 
premium-quality cooking...

297
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,810
He's bringing himself down with his own talk.

298
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:58,530
Can we really beat meat like that?

299
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,870
Y'know...

300
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,830
You know what?

301
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,250
Don RS should go with beef too.

302
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,420
Huh?!

303
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,670
Look here, Yukihira.

304
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,340
Were you even listening to me?

305
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,630
We don't have a snowball's chance in—

306
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,580
You said it yourself, Konishi-senpai.

307
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,010
The don is about speed, taste, and affordability.

308
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,720
Nikumi's making fun of that maxim.

309
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,390
If we're to make her respect the don,

310
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,350
we have to win with a fast and easy beef dish!

311
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,390
Also, we can't use super premium ingredients.

312
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,650
That's not where the don shines.

313
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,110
A-At times, men must compromise their principles in order to win.

314
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,890
Okay.

315
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,110
Let's go shopping.

316
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,620
How much do you have left in Don RS's budget?

317
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,830
W-Well...

318
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,910
Huh?

319
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,370
That's it?

320
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,210
I'll just have to chip in from my personal funds!

321
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,920
This is all I have?!

322
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,010
<i>Thank you for your business.</i>

323
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,090
I'll send you some money to live on.

324
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,850
<i>This is what "some" meant?</i>

325
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,560
That's <i>what you meant?</i>

326
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,150
<i>This is rough.</i>

327
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,110
<i>I might be in trouble.</i>

328
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,000
These are Don RS's recipe
 collections from the past.

329
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,770
You might find something useful in there.

330
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,360
Senpai, I found some more of them.

331
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,600
Oh, thanks!

332
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,530
Put that stack over there.

333
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,610
All right!

334
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,540
Let's do this!

335
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,430
All done!

336
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,840
Have a taste, please!

337
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,170
A cutlet don, subbing in beef for pork!

338
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,420
I changed the Don RS recipe by using a mix of chicken and quail eggs,

339
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,900
so it should have a richer taste.

340
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,840
It's not bad, but it's still not enough!

341
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,480
There isn't enough impact in the first bite.

342
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,210
Nikumi's dishes always deliver
 a punch in the mouth.

343
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,680
A punch, huh?

344
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,900
Then we're talking fat!

345
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,820
How about a sukiyaki don made with sugar and beef fat, all finished off with a chicken egg?

346
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:04,990
This won't work, either.

347
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,880
The flavor's not refined enough!

348
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,210
Okay, we can decrease the amount 
of beef fat, and instead...

349
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,920
Um, how about this recipe?

350
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,150
Senpai's gone deathly pale again!

351
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,610
Splash water on him to get him back!

352
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:51,290
<i>We've followed all the promising leads in Don RS's recipe collection.</i>

353
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:55,000
<i>We've tried every single variation we could think of.</i>

354
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,990
Souma-kun, why don't you
 go and get some rest?

355
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,220
Maybe you'll come up with something if you take a break,

356
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,720
just like that day in class.

357
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,350
Maybe.

358
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,980
Oh, like how I used honey
 to tenderize the meat.

359
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,230
S-Souma-kun?

360
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,320
I owe you one, Tadokoro!

361
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,450
I've got an idea.

362
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,150
I think I know how to make
 affordable meat sing!

363
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,740
Konishi-san!

364
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,580
It can be sirloin or even the rump!

365
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,080
Do you have any steaks left?

366
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,620
Steaks?

367
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,580
Slice a grid pattern into a steak,

368
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,540
then pound it out flat.

369
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:41,130
Spread minced onions on both sides of the meat, then let it rest.

370
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,660
Remove the onions,

371
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,470
then season the meat with salt and pepper.

372
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,730
Cook the steak in butter,

373
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:52,460
then sauté the onions in the drippings.

374
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,770
Onions...

375
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,900
Sprinkle the cooked onions on top of the meat, and it's done.

376
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,610
It's a Chaliapin steak!

377
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,690
When the opera singer
 Fyodor Chaliapin came to Japan,

378
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,290
he was suffering from a toothache.

379
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:16,000
"May I have a tender steak?"
That request inspired this dish.

380
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,920
It's an offbeat dish that can only be found in Japan!

381
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,170
All right, both of you try it.

382
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,700
O-Okay!

383
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,630
A'ight.

384
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,610
<i>So light!</i>

385
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,320
It's so tender!

386
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,240
You can easily cut it with chopsticks!

387
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,740
And every time you bite into it...

388
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,240
<i>...it dissolves in your mouth.</i>

389
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:56,650
Onions have enzymes that tenderize proteins,

390
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,630
just like pineapples and honey.

391
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,590
That's why the meat is so tender.

392
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,690
<i>I wouldn't have guessed 
that this was a cheap cut of beef.</i>

393
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,180
<i>My mouth's full of its flavor.</i>

394
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,140
<i>And it goes without saying that it pairs well with rice.</i>

395
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,810
<i>But...</i>

396
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,100
<i>will this really be enough...</i>

397
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,530
<i>to surpass Nikumi's A5 meat?</i>

398
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,580
I'll use Japanese Black wagyu fillet.

399
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:00,410
A5 grade, of course. Not only that,

400
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,630
it'll have been aged over a month to be at its peak flavor the day it's served.

401
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,510
In other words, it'll be an A5 to top all A5 beef.

402
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,860
I'll cook it in a way that optimizes its taste,

403
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,720
and I'll crush the Don RS.

404
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,680
I have high hopes.

405
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,890
Excuse me.

406
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,440
<i>I didn't think an opportunity would come so soon.</i>

407
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,980
<i>Yukihira Souma.</i>

408
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,280
<i>I will take this chance to purge you from Tohtsuki.</i>

409
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,620
Next time on <i>Shokugeki no Souma</i>,

410
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,710
the seventh dish:

411
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,000
The Quiet Don, the Eloquent Don.

412
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,510
Enjoy.

413
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,300
What a demanding body you have!
