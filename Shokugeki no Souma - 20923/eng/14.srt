1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:04,730
All right!

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,940
Another batch of fluffy soufflé omelettes!

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:08,400
All done!

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,700
<i>I can't believe nobody's taken even a single plate!</i>

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,200
<i>The soufflés have collapsed?</i>

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,660
<i>Of course!</i>

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,120
<i>At a buffet, the food won't get eaten right away!</i>

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,660
<i>It's not like Yukihira,</i>

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,250
<i>where I can serve each dish to the customer at the right time and temperature!</i>

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,000
<i>At a buffet,</i>

11
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,260
<i>customers decide when they'll come for a dish.</i>

12
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,220
<i>But a soufflé's texture can only be enjoyed the moment it's finished.</i>

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,770
<i>You can't appreciate the dish otherwise.</i>

14
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,640
<i>Crap!</i>

15
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,690
<i>No matter how many plates I set out,</i>

16
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,520
<i>the soufflés will fall before
 the customers come up to take one.</i>

17
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,070
<i>Shit!</i>

18
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,530
<i>Not to mention...</i>

19
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,280
<i>Nakiri's dish is luring away
 all of my potential customers.</i>

20
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,200
Nakiri Erina! 200 servings, complete!

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,960
I suppose you understand by now.

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,420
In a buffet,

23
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,590
the stability and aesthetic appeal of a dish are of utmost importance.

24
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,420
Long story short,

25
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,140
you couldn't possibly have chosen a dish that was more ill-suited for this task.

26
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,260
It seems I'll be finally bidding you farewell.

27
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,850
I hope you can appreciate the beauty of my dish in the little time you have left.

28
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,700
<i>The main ingredient will be eggs.</i>

29
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,740
<i>Your dish must be worthy of acknowledgment by professional producers and staff.</i>

30
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,710
<i>And 200 servings of your dish must be consumed within two hours.</i>

31
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,580
<i>The criteria for passing this test are not trivial.</i>

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,590
<i>Now is the moment of truth.</i>

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,590
<i>This will be a true battle for survival.</i>

34
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,380
Shit!

35
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,550
I've had no takers after the 150th bowl!

36
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,010
I've set out some more servings!

37
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,390
Please don't push!

38
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,220
What's going on?

39
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,390
I hear she made some more!

40
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,940
<i>After just one customer tried her dish,</i>

41
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,570
<i>there was so much uproar that
 she drew away everyone near me.</i>

42
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,690
<i>So those </i>weren't<i> </i><i>just any normal eggs.</i>

43
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,160
<i>I had no idea her dish held such a secret.</i>

44
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,120
This isn't a raw egg!

45
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,640
What looks like egg white is a gelée made from diluted seawater!

46
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,380
And the yolk is actually salmon roe held together with gelatin!

47
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,580
What?!

48
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,460
At first glance, this appears to be a boiled egg.

49
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,380
But the egg white is really a mousse of white asparagus,

50
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,650
while in place of the yolk,

51
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,140
there's a rich, yolky hollandaise sauce!

52
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,010
The creamy egg flavor strikes the perfect balance

53
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,440
with the slight tinge of bitterness
 from the white asparagus!

54
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,730
So what's with this egg that's still in its shell?

55
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,560
Oh, this? Well...

56
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,610
She stabbed it?!

57
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,360
It's a milkshake you drink with a straw.

58
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:28,450
I took an empty egg shell and filled it with a milkshake that I made from eggs, milk, and caramel.

59
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,370
<i>I-It's delicious!</i>

60
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:39,590
<i>Its mildness and refreshing aftertaste are a perfect complement to a morning meal!</i>

61
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,460
In ensemble,

62
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,550
I call this set the "Egg Plate in Three Forms."

63
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,010
<i>It's a staggering masterpiece!</i>

64
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,850
<i>Each "egg" contains an entire 
world of surprising flavor.</i>

65
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,400
<i>On this single plate,</i>

66
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,400
<i>the flavors of the sea,</i>

67
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,400
<i>the forest,</i>

68
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,320
<i>and grassland have been combined!</i>

69
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,820
Wow!

70
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,570
I want more!

71
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,080
Another!

72
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,780
Me too!

73
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,530
Me, me!

74
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,580
Please let me have one!

75
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,580
<i>You've got to be kidding me!</i>

76
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,540
<i>At that rate, she'll totally serve over 300!</i>

77
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,380
Takumi Aldini! 200 servings, complete!

78
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,300
All right!

79
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:27,510
Yukihira!

80
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,890
What <i>is</i> he doing?

81
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,350
Tadokoro Megumi! 200 servings, complete!

82
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,560
Phew.

83
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,270
Souma-kun?

84
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,770
The all-nighter I pulled is catching up to me.

85
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,190
Erina-sama snagged all of my customers,
so no one's taking any more of my dish.

86
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,110
I'm done for!

87
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,830
<i>Calm down.</i>

88
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,540
<i>Calm down.</i>

89
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,500
<i>Two new customers!</i>

90
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,340
<i>Souma, set out some hand towels and appetizers!</i>

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,590
<i>Hurry up and clear Table 3!</i>

92
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,550
<i>Table 4 needs their check!</i>

93
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,300
<i>I can't do all of that at the same time!</i>

94
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,010
<i>Appetizers, right?</i>

95
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,760
<i>Appetizers... uh...</i>

96
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,720
<i>And... huh?</i>

97
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,640
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

98
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,350
<i>It's all jumbled up in my head.</i>

99
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,810
<i>I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore.</i>

100
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,030
<i>Ow!</i>

101
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,780
<i>Ow...</i>

102
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,280
<i>Listen up, Souma.</i>

103
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,280
<i>If you find yourself panicking in the kitchen, stop and analyze the situation.</i>

104
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,910
<i>Visualize each task you have to do,</i>

105
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,620
<i>and take things from there.</i>

106
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,790
My condolences.

107
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,040
But this is the gap between your skill and mine.

108
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,460
Now do you understand?

109
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,420
<i>Uh, what?</i>

110
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,630
<i>He didn't fall asleep, did he?</i>

111
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,340
I have a little over thirty minutes left.

112
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,890
First, attract customers.

113
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,520
I need just under a minute to cook
 the omelette on one side,

114
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,900
How many burners do I have?

115
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,480
Prepare the ingredients.

116
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,480
What's he muttering about?

117
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,980
This is gonna be close.

118
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,450
<i>He can't possibly think that he can serve 200 people in the time left!</i>

119
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,910
<i>How on earth does he plan on doing that?</i>

120
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,290
All right!

121
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,250
<i>There's very little time remaining.</i>

122
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,710
<i>His chances are slim to none.</i>

123
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,170
<i>What are you going to do, Yukihira Souma?</i>

124
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,760
<i>Get the first one!</i>

125
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,170
<i>Win over the first customer!</i>

126
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,010
<i>That's step one!</i>

127
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,970
What's this? Wow!

128
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,180
I know what this is!

129
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,350
It's called Eggs Benedict!

130
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,350
Ow!

131
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,230
C'mere!

132
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,820
Watch closely, little miss.

133
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,030
I'm gonna cast a magic spell on this egg!

134
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:51,900
There.

135
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,580
Wow!

136
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,970
Wow, it smells so good!

137
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,470
Here you go!

138
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,690
It's jiggling.

139
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,280
Wow, so delicious!

140
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,700
It dissolved like bubbles
 in my mouth and vanished.

141
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,740
I told you it was magic!

142
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,950
Huh? What's going on?

143
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,580
Isn't it just an omelette?

144
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,370
<i>So what if he gets one or two at this point?</i>

145
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,840
<i>It won't change anything.</i>

146
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,460
Here you go!

147
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,300
What?

148
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,340
What <i>is</i> this?

149
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,890
It tastes like an omelette,

150
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,600
but its texture is like a sweet soufflé!

151
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,270
Wow!

152
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,350
Hey, look!

153
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,770
The surface is cooked, 
but the inside has all these bubbles,

154
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,020
so it's really springy when 
you press on it with a spoon.

155
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,480
It's really bouncy!

156
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,080
What's going on over here?

157
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,900
Hey, let's check this out.

158
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,860
Here you go!

159
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,240
Another!

160
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,370
<i>Okay! I'm starting to draw a crowd.</i>

161
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,580
<i>I can't let this chance pass me by!</i>

162
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,580
<i>He still needs to serve well over a hundred.</i>

163
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,080
<i>How's he going to do that in thirty minutes?</i>

164
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,090
<i>It's impossible.</i>

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,800
The battle's only just begun!

166
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,220
There!

167
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,280
200 servings, complete!

168
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,700
200 servings, complete!

169
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,860
Oh, how disappointing.

170
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,360
I've run out of ingredients.

171
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,870
I didn't think so many people
would want to eat what I made.

172
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,000
Very well.

173
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,120
You may wrap things up.

174
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,830
Thank you!

175
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,250
Bye, bye!

176
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,040
<i>I can't believe that bitch!</i>

177
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,140
<i>She managed 380 servings!</i>

178
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,680
I'm bored.

179
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,100
Maybe I'll go check in on Erina.

180
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,730
Oh, come to think of it...

181
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,440
<i>I wonder what happened to that guy.</i>

182
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,070
<i>Yukihira Souma-kun.</i>

183
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,160
<i>Put the lids on,</i>

184
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,870
<i>and while they steam,</i>

185
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,330
<i>prep the ingredients for the next batch.</i>

186
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,150
He's so fast!

187
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,550
His hands are a blur!

188
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,050
<i>All right!</i>

189
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,470
<i>Beat the egg whites,</i>

190
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,430
<i>then add egg yolks and heavy cream.</i>

191
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,390
<i>Add salt and pepper.</i>

192
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,310
<i>Seasoning? Good.</i>

193
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,810
<i>This batch is just about done.</i>

194
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,340
<i>Plate...</i>

195
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,050
<i>with the special tomato sauce and parsley.</i>

196
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,510
Thanks for waiting!

197
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,060
Hey!

198
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,180
The booth next to this one looks pretty amazing!

199
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,060
You're right!

200
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,480
<i>He stole my customers!</i>

201
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,190
Despite the significant workload,

202
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,610
he's actually ratcheting up the pace as he goes.

203
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,740
Every time he finishes one batch,

204
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,290
he's further optimizing his preparation.

205
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,510
Delicious!

206
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,710
It's melting.

207
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,800
Wow! It's so fluffy!

208
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,180
They're going fast,

209
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,100
and the crowd's only getting bigger.

210
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,480
The more people there are, the more come.

211
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,690
There's something called live cooking,

212
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,270
where food is prepared right in front of customers

213
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,990
instead of taking prepared food to their table.

214
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,410
Doing that heightens their 
expectations for the dish,

215
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:49,030
and watching ingredients turn into a finished dish is exhilarating.

216
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,650
Wow!

217
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,060
He's churning them out!

218
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,210
He's so fast!

219
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,920
So cool.

220
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,300
Yukihira is attracting his customers

221
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,510
by putting on a fantastic show.

222
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,140
He's entrancing them 
with his skills and his cooking.

223
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,440
That's how he's turned things
 around to his advantage.

224
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,480
Sakaki Ryouko! 200 servings, complete!

225
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,450
Yoshino Yuuki! 200 servings, complete!

226
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,580
Finally!

227
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,540
Yeah!

228
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,420
I passed!

229
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,880
I wonder how Bro's doing.

230
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,140
Five minutes remaining!

231
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,470
<i>Yukihira...</i>

232
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,390
<i>Souma-kun!</i>

233
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Wow.

234
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,390
Yukihira Souma! 200 servings, complete!

235
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,000
Time's up!

236
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,060
Stop!

237
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,370
What's with that smug look?!

238
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,200
Barely scraping by is nothing to be proud—

239
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,460
I'm so surprised!

240
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,580
I thought you'd only manage
 eight servings at most!

241
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,420
But you managed to pull through by putting on that circus act.

242
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,670
Huh?

243
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,970
Talk about a final push.

244
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,010
Indeed.

245
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:15,510
What this task requires is the ability to envision the situation.

246
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,310
A hotel breakfast and a buffet at that.

247
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,690
The key is the ability to imagine in great detail

248
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:27,860
what kind of dish such a situation would require.

249
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,740
And one more thing.

250
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,910
Given that unexpected emergencies constantly arise in kitchens,

251
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,080
there is one thing that is absolutely essential.

252
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,300
He gave himself a huge handicap
 with his menu choice,

253
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,290
but his adaptability allowed him to
 overcome that with impressive flair.

254
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:48,590
What an interesting diamond in the rough.

255
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,260
But still,

256
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,720
the student who served 407 people sure was something.

257
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:57,890
Nakiri Erina was the only student to crack 400.

258
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:03,230
And there was that other student, who used up all her ingredients and served 380.

259
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,610
Still, you'll never win the top spot
 if your cooking relies on a circus act like that.

260
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:13,860
What you need is workmanship rooted in cutting-edge theory.

261
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,490
Something like my own cooking, for example. Right?

262
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,660
I believe I haven't introduced myself yet.

263
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,830
I am Nakiri Alice.

264
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,880
I'm the one who'll stand above all of you.

265
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,130
Remember that.

266
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,800
Nakiri Alice?

267
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,220
Nakiri?

268
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,970
Yes, Erina and I are cousins.

269
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,560
I lived with her until I was five.

270
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,390
There you are, Miss.

271
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,600
Oh, what good timing!

272
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,650
Come!

273
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,940
Explain my upbringing to Yukihira Souma-kun.

274
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,190
Oh...

275
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,610
Well...

276
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,200
Miss Alice is Miss Erina's cousin, and—

277
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,490
I already said that!

278
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,700
Never mind! I'll continue!

279
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,120
My father chose Denmark, my mother's homeland,

280
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,080
as his base of operations when he founded Nakiri International.

281
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,000
It's a facility dedicated to researching molecular gastronomy.

282
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,260
They come up with cutting-edge food preparation techniques

283
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:18,680
based on how they affect not only the senses of taste and smell

284
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,470
but also cerebral psychology.

285
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,600
I was there until I was fourteen,

286
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,650
then came to Tohtsuki...

287
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,360
to crush Erina and become
 number one at Tohtsuki.

288
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:39,070
My cooking will never lose to a chef who only values modern spectacle.

289
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,030
How mean!

290
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,450
You've always been this way!

291
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,790
When I was three, you stole my toys.

292
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,250
When I was four, you said
 the cake I made for you was...

293
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,170
Disgusting.

294
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,140
And I'll never forget how, when I was five—

295
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,300
Wh-What's that have to do with anything now?

296
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,810
Not to mention you, Yukihira Souma-kun.

297
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,430
You talked big at the entrance ceremony,

298
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:09,450
but performance art in cooking 
belongs to a bygone era.

299
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,650
As proof of that,

300
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:15,440
you barely scraped by a task requiring 200 servings.

301
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,120
Yeah, I was sweating bullets there!

302
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,840
Being ignorant is scary!

303
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,240
I really messed that one up.

304
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:24,750
But...

305
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,580
I did learn something from my mistake.

306
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,290
You're a shrewd one.

307
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,010
In any case, I won't lose to you two!

308
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,760
I look forward to when I get
 to defeat you head-to-head.

309
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,350
Sounds like fun.

310
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,010
I'll take you on when that happens.

311
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,310
Good!

312
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,310
Well, until then.

313
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,390
Yukihira!

314
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,690
Souma-kun!

315
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,530
Jeez! I was so worried!

316
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:02,160
How can you be so reckless?!

317
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,120
Huh?

318
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,450
Oh, sorry.

319
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:08,250
The following concerns those
 who completed 200 servings!

320
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,540
The next task will begin in four hours.

321
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,960
You are free to rest until then.

322
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,380
You've got to be kidding!

323
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,920
We only get three or so hours of sleep?!

324
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,720
That's right.

325
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,640
The camp...

326
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,220
...isn't over!

327
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,470
I'm done for.

328
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,340
I can barely move my legs.

329
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,920
I want to lie down.

330
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,830
I'm totally spent.

331
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,900
Huh?

332
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,330
Wh-Why have we been summoned to the lobby?

333
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,000
There's nothing listed on the schedule.

334
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,340
Huh? Wait, the last time that happened...

335
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,470
Don't tell me there's another task like that coming up.

336
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,680
Good.

337
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,760
It seems all of you are here.

338
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,640
Not again!

339
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,390
Before we begin, I'd like to say a few words.

340
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,070
At this point in time,
 352 students have dropped out,

341
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,690
and only 628 students remain.

342
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,570
This may seem cruel,

343
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,910
but this camp is a microcosm of what 
it means to choose cooking as your career.

344
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,740
You'll need to stay calm
 when facing the unknown

345
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,410
and commune with your ingredients.

346
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,330
If you become a chef,
 there will be great pressure.

347
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,750
You'll endure countless nights
 of anxiety and indecision,

348
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,380
adapt to a wide range of situations,

349
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,510
and overcome those challenges.

350
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:49,180
This life is akin to wandering alone 
through a barren, wind-torn wasteland.

351
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,600
The farther you walk, the more you will stumble,

352
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,440
and the hazier your goal becomes.

353
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,400
You may reach a standstill 
after making it to the pinnacle

354
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,650
and lose sight of how to return.

355
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,650
But I want you to remember one thing!

356
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,990
Here at Tohtsuki, you're with others who would tread the same wasteland.

357
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:14,830
This fact will sustain you once
 you sally forth and go on alone.

358
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,630
I wish all of you the best of luck from the bottom of my heart!

359
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,690
Now then,

360
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,630
let us begin the final program of this camp.

361
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,470
I knew it!

362
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,810
Welcome!

363
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:37,480
The final program consists of a modest banquet
 to celebrate the conclusion of the training camp.

364
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,030
You will be enjoying a full course meal prepared by the alumni.

365
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,450
Let me now say to all 628 of you who survived:

366
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,370
Congratulations for passing the training camp!

367
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,240
Enjoy it to your heart's content!

368
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,700
All right!

369
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,880
Seriously?!

370
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,990
I can't believe it!

371
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,380
This isn't "modest" by a long stretch!

372
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,550
We're probably the only people in the whole wide world who can eat something like this.

373
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,420
I'm glad to be alive—

374
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,220
Marui's finally kicked the bucket!

375
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:12,760
Thank you.

376
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,950
So good!

377
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,370
Don't cry, Yoshino.

378
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,250
<i>Cooking school?</i>

379
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,460
<i>Why do I have to go to a school like this now?</i>

380
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,880
<i>Paying to learn how to cook is so stupid.</i>

381
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,430
Is something wrong, Souma-kun?

382
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,100
Oh, nah.

383
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:57,310
I think this school might be more
 interesting than I expected, after all.

384
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,270
Huh? What do you mean?

385
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,270
Nothing, just thinking out loud.

386
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,860
C'mon, let's eat.

387
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,650
Okay!

388
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:26,360
This year is shaping up to be very interesting with regard to that upcoming event.

389
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,320
Yes. It's something to look forward to.

390
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,530
These diamonds in the rough will be facing off against each other in a major event:

391
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,490
the Autumn Selection.

392
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,720
Next time on <i>Shokugeki no Souma</i>,

393
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,620
the fifteenth dish:

394
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:44,540
Huh?!

395
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,960
What?!

396
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,960
The Man They Called the Demon.

397
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,970
So yummy!

398
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,070
I'm going to meet a better chef than me!

399
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,600
Rawr.
