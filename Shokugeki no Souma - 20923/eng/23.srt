1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:02,850
Zero points!

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:03,730
Zero!

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:04,940
Another zero!

4
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,690
Does Sendawara Natsume
 only give out zeros?

5
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,940
The scoring equipment isn't broken, is it?

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,160
That's Nakiri Alice's aide.

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,450
What dish will he present?

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,700
I heard he had quite the crowd lined up
 at camp when we had to serve 200 people.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,670
That's the boy who was preparing lobsters.

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,130
He was a completely different
person while he was cooking.

11
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:41,980
Ah, the contrast between the fiery red of the lobster
and the vibrant yellow of the saffron rice is beautiful.

12
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,520
The lobster shell is immaculate,

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,150
with no damage to the legs or antennae.

14
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,340
That <i>is</i> noteworthy.

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,820
This delicate and elegant plating is unexpected,

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,820
given his dynamic style of cooking.

17
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,030
Hmph. There are any number of
 restaurants that serve lobster curry.

18
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,950
Mere seafood curry is hardly worth the attention you're lavishing on it.

19
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:04,490
<i>A forest.</i>

20
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,170
<i>I'm deep in a forest.</i>

21
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,790
<i>What </i>is<i> this?</i>

22
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,170
<i>What's behind this fragrance?</i>

23
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,140
Whoa, that's the first time today that Natsume-sama took a second bite!

24
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,400
How does it taste?

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,510
What's it like?!

26
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,030
This is... Group A.

27
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,370
Candidate Kurokiba's dish
 is currently being judged.

28
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,420
Sauce américaine forms the base of the curry,

29
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,590
a French sauce made with the shells of crustaceans.

30
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,170
As for this deep forest fragrance,

31
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,180
it must originate from...

32
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,760
cognac!

33
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,350
That's high-quality brandy made in the area around Cognac, a town in western France.

34
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,770
Of course!

35
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,570
As the brandy ages, it takes on the scent of the wood used for the barrels!

36
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:41,740
That's why this curry has rich woody notes of cedar and sandalwood.

37
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,450
That's exactly right.

38
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,990
Please note that, in order 
to impart a richer fragrance,

39
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,620
I used the highest grade of cognac, Napoléon cognac.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,500
To think that the fragrance of cognac could enhance curry to this extent!

41
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,590
This is a fabulous French lobster curry!

42
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,880
He's the first one to get a positive reception from the judges!

43
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,250
I always knew he was really good!

44
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,010
<i>It's been a while, Erina.</i>

45
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,060
<i>Allow me to introduce him to you.</i>

46
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,680
<i>Now </i>I<i> have an aide too.</i>

47
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,440
<i>This boy is your aide?</i>

48
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,190
<i>Yes.</i>

49
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,810
<i>I found him in Scandinavia.</i>

50
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,110
<i>You sound like you adopted a stray dog.</i>

51
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,190
<i>Come on, Ryou-kun. Say hello.</i>

52
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,200
<i>Hey.</i>

53
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,200
<i>I see.</i>

54
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,910
<i>So this is why Alice picked him up.</i>

55
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,160
Finally, a dish worth judging has shown itself.

56
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,660
But still...

57
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,830
Is that really <i>all</i> there is to that dish?

58
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,750
W-Well, it wasn't horrible.

59
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,380
I suppose this may be worth a few points.

60
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,280
Let me think—

61
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,130
Ah.

62
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,180
Uh...

63
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,640
Oh, okay, here it was.

64
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,650
It's not over yet!

65
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,150
The tasting isn't over.

66
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,610
Do you really have to put that on every time?

67
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,990
Hm, eye droppers?

68
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,610
It seems there's more cognac inside.

69
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,580
There's a part of the lobster 
you haven't tasted yet.

70
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,330
It's what's in the lobster's head, the tomalley.

71
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:18,250
Put a few drops of this inside the shell,
 then slurp up the tomalley.

72
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,210
That's the best way to eat it.

73
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,670
Slurp?!

74
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,220
As if I could eat in such a crude manner!

75
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,720
At least crack the shell and 
serve it on a plate or something.

76
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,470
What's with all the posturing?

77
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:31,970
You—

78
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,100
I can tell from the look in your eyes.

79
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,850
Why don't you show everyone your real face?

80
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,690
Admit it, you want to suck it down right this second, don't you?

81
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,610
After you slurp the cognac and tomalley,

82
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,150
stuff your mouth with roux and saffron rice again.

83
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,240
It'll be so much better than
 what you had before.

84
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,000
<i>So much better than before?!</i>

85
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,810
<i>The delicious flavor of seafood bursts in your mouth
 and mingles with the deep fragrance of the forest!</i>

86
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,240
<i>I feel...</i>

87
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,910
<i>faint...</i>

88
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,000
Candidate Kurokiba, 93 points!

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,630
Wow!

90
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,520
He's so far ahead!

91
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,970
I can't believe this!

92
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,680
93 points?!

93
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,510
I thought Hayama Akira would be
 the one to win Group A by a landslide.

94
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,730
Talk about a dark horse candidate!

95
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,730
I've been continually thrown
 into culinary fields of battle...

96
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,890
for as long as I can remember.

97
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,960
Compared to that, this is a walk in the park!

98
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,800
What an amazing score!

99
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,760
Is there anyone who can score higher than him?!

100
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,180
Well, that's that.

101
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,020
93 points, huh.

102
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,320
I must say, that was quite a surprise.

103
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,460
There have been years where the scores topped out in the 70's or 80's.

104
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,410
<i>Th-That was a total ambush.</i>

105
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,410
<i>I never expected anything that impressive.</i>

106
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,950
<i>I need to calm down.</i>

107
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:04,250
Very well, th-the next candidate, please!

108
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,880
Oh!

109
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,250
Wh-What's this?

110
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,590
Please enjoy. My curry dish is...

111
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,470
Dongpo pork curry!

112
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,730
Dongpo pork is a dish where pork belly is braised with soy sauce.

113
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,420
But never mind that. Look at
 how beautiful this meat is!

114
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,810
It's glistening!

115
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,200
Because the alternating layers of meat
 and fat appear to be stacked threefold,

116
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,690
pork belly is sometimes called "three-layer meat."

117
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,610
Even the slightest touch of the bowl sets the meat quivering.

118
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,450
Yet despite becoming so tender,
 it has retained its shape!

119
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,080
It is proof that the cooking temperature was masterfully controlled.

120
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,130
This dish is sensuous in the extreme!

121
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,170
Even before my first bite, 
my tongue is aflutter with anticipation.

122
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,090
Looks like Mito-san's dish is
 faring well with the judges too.

123
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,720
Nice one, Nikumi.

124
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,550
Awesome job, Nikumi!

125
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:01,400
That thick cut of meat must've
 soaked up a lot of the tasty broth!

126
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:07,650
I wonder what it'd be like 
to take a huge bite out of that!

127
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,110
<i>H-Hold on!</i>

128
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,740
<i>I'm still recovering from the 
impact of that lobster curry,</i>

129
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,530
<i>and now I'm supposed 
to judge a dish like this?!</i>

130
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,280
What's the matter?

131
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:24,370
Savor and enjoy this ultimate meat in all its glory.

132
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,880
Meat!

133
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,550
It's <i>so</i> tender!

134
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,800
The moment you bite into it,

135
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,220
the meat's juices gush out in a flood!

136
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,720
The gamy taste associated with skin-on pork belly has been erased by the spices.

137
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,680
The only flavors left are the
 sweet fat and the rich curry.

138
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,560
It's astounding!

139
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,440
After parboiling the pork belly,
 I browned the meat,

140
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,820
then braised it with soy sauce, oyster sauce, and Shaoxing wine.

141
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,530
For spices, I used star anise, ginger, and Sichuan peppercorn.

142
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:06,500
<i>But why is it that I can eat so much meat without feeling bloated?</i>

143
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,920
Of course! It's the rice!

144
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,250
The rice has a small amount of
 rock salt and peppercorn oil mixed in!

145
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:19,260
The oil's numbing tingle and refreshing overtones cut the oiliness of the meat.

146
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,560
But it also makes you crave the sweet flavor of the fat, creating a virtuous cycle.

147
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,270
She's created a feedback loop
 of delectability in this bowl!

148
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:31,400
E-Excuse me! There are still
 several dishes to be judged,

149
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,190
so please be mindful of how much you eat.

150
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,360
No way...

151
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:34,940
What?

152
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,070
We know there are more dishes, but there's no way we can stop!

153
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,070
<i>Mito Ikumi...</i>

154
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:45,290
<i>From the day she entered the academy, her intuition and knowledge of meat exceeded anyone else's.</i>

155
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,330
<i>The problem was that she was prone to neglecting all of the other ingredients.</i>

156
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:53,750
<i>But it's as clear as day from this dish that her cooking has evolved.</i>

157
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,170
<i>The fat and the roux are melting into a wonderful harmony in my mouth.</i>

158
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,590
<i>What bliss.</i>

159
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:07,810
<i>This dish is so devastatingly good that it makes you believe this is the </i>only<i> way to cook pork belly.</i>

160
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,850
<i>Without question, she is the Meat Master.</i>

161
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,020
<i>No, she is far better than that.</i>

162
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,070
Oh, meat!

163
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,400
<i>She is the Meat General!</i>

164
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,530
Meat!

165
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,840
Meat, oh!

166
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,950
Candidate Mito has scored 86 points!

167
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,620
What a high score!

168
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,080
That puts her solidly in second place!

169
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,160
Damn.

170
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,250
I didn't make it into the 90's.

171
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,300
Nikumi, that was amazing!

172
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,790
It looked super tasty.

173
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,000
It's what I learned from you, Yukihira.

174
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,840
A don should be complete in one bowl, right?

175
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,220
You really do understand, huh?

176
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,770
Nikumi, good job!

177
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:50,180
Wow, I'm so relieved.

178
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,350
This is finally starting to feel like a competition!

179
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,060
Let's keep this going!

180
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,320
Next up is Candidate Sakaki Ryouko.

181
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,150
Please enjoy.

182
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,660
It's everything I have to offer right now.

183
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,570
It looks pretty plain, doesn't it?

184
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,660
Compared to the previous dishes,
 there isn't much visual impact.

185
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,160
Hm, it look to be dal, also called pulse curry.

186
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,920
It bears some resemblance to chana masala.

187
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,670
Wait, I know this sticky substance!

188
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,250
It's natto!

189
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:22,880
<i>The viscosity and umami are coating my mouth.</i>

190
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,720
<i>I didn't think natto could be this delicious.</i>

191
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,310
No, it's not just <i>any</i> natto.

192
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,770
It can't be...

193
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,480
It's natto made over a charcoal flame:

194
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,020
charcoal-fermented natto.

195
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,610
I maintained a charcoal fire in an underground chamber to assure optimal temperature and humidity,

196
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:45,530
while soybeans were fermented with the natto spore for several days.

197
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,620
I made use of my time over
 summer break to make it.

198
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,830
Slowly fermenting soybeans over a charcoal fire allows you to create a more complex flavor.

199
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,760
Since the natto mold isn't killed during this process,

200
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,840
the odor of ammonia is considerably less.

201
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,210
But that's not the only thing!

202
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,550
What is it?!

203
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,630
What is this umami that hits your palate like a deep bass note?

204
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,220
My secret ingredient is soy sauce rice malt.

205
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,890
Soy sauce rice malt!

206
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,470
First you mix soy sauce into rice malt.

207
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,310
Then you let the mixture ferment for
several weeks at room temperature.

208
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,850
I get it.

209
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,020
The black substance I saw her using

210
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,020
was the soy sauce rice malt,

211
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,780
and the sticky substance was natto.

212
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:29,200
Soy sauce rice malt has over ten times the glutamic acid of salted rice malt.

213
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,620
That's how she could add more umami
 without the strong curry flavor eclipsing it.

214
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,000
It's a great curry dish that takes full advantage of her mastery of fermentation.

215
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:44,010
<i>The thick Japanese-style curry pairs well with the viscous natto.</i>

216
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,970
<i>The generous pile of finely sliced
 green onion is irresistible as well.</i>

217
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,560
<i>She has used her mastery over the
 power of soybeans to perfect this dish.</i>

218
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,430
<i>I'd be proud to call her a sister-in-arms...</i>

219
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,400
<i>or rather, Mistress!</i>

220
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,410
Candidate Sakaki has scored 86 points!

221
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,240
That's the same score as Candidate Mito!

222
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,330
Good job, Sakaki!

223
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,710
She's in second place!

224
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,990
You make some really cool things, Sakaki.

225
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,090
Let me have some next time.

226
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,100
Sure. Of course!

227
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,850
This place is getting fired up!

228
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,850
Who's next?

229
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,560
Oh...

230
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,600
It's <i>him</i>.

231
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,860
I bet most of the people here don't have any expectations of me.

232
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,770
Mr. Marui.

233
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,680
Mr. Marui!

234
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,650
Mr. Marui.

235
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,780
Good luck, Mr. Marui!

236
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,120
But just you watch. I'll stir things up.

237
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,030
Here, go ahead.

238
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,240
Oh, um... uh...

239
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,200
Calm down!

240
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,800
Okay, I'm Enomoto Madoka!

241
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,110
Like Mr. Marui, I'm part of the Miyazato research lab.

242
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,440
Mr. Marui and I...

243
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,960
Me and Mr. Marui...

244
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,930
Next is Candidate Marui!

245
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:08,920
Please show us your di-

246
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,610
It's so white.

247
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,050
The roux and ingredients are all white!

248
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,510
The noodles are udon.

249
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,350
They've been kneaded with cumin.

250
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,190
So this is your version of curry udon?

251
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,650
Yes. It's white potage curry udon.

252
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:29,650
Hm. It's quite beautiful.

253
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,950
If Kurokiba-kun's dish was
 a tumult of color,

254
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,490
then this dish is
 like a tranquil lake.

255
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,450
Let us begin.

256
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,330
Whatever, I doubt it'll get high marks.

257
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:43,960
The only thing I remember about Marui is that he was about to kick the bucket during camp.

258
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,930
E-Excuse me...

259
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,270
Could one of you please comment on the dish?

260
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,600
P-Please don't ignore me!

261
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
What?!

262
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,440
They're all chowing down like there's no tomorrow!

263
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,110
A plump poached egg, creamy mashed potatoes,

264
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,200
and a generous amount of piping hot, melted cheese.

265
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,530
The roux is like a vichyssoise!

266
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,700
Vichyssoise...

267
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,750
A dense soup made mainly from
 potatoes and fresh cream.

268
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,300
It's a dish devised in 1917 by Louis Diat,

269
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,760
the head chef of the luxury hotel Ritz-Carlton.

270
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:35,260
Though it might appear to be thick and heavy, you can just keep on eating it.

271
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,930
It's coriander that makes the udon so light, isn't it?

272
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:45,600
<i>Coriander is known for its mild overtones, 
which is reminiscent of citrus, and its faint spiciness.</i>

273
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,280
<i>The synergy between it and the cumin in the noodles enhances the fragrance of both.</i>

274
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,320
<i>This is an unbelievably satisfying dish!</i>

275
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,240
I have included dill, which is a
 mainstay topping in vichyssoise.

276
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,750
By roasting the seeds of dill
 and cumin together,

277
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,830
I have created a very fragrant soup.

278
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,480
He has taken the trendy dipping ramen concept and applied it to vichyssoise, a century-old dish!

279
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,260
How wonderful!

280
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,170
Mr. Marui!

281
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,760
Well done, Mr. Marui!

282
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,080
Mr. Marui!

283
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,260
Well done.

284
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:22,270
It's the perfect showcase for your talents, Marui Zenji.

285
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,110
At my research lab, we research and analyze historic texts on food.

286
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,740
Despite being only a first-year,
 Marui-kun is the star of our lab.

287
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,200
<i>I don't have a keen sense for cooking.</i>

288
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,820
<i>I tire faster than most people.</i>

289
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,790
<i>That's all the more reason for me to study as hard as I do.</i>

290
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,620
<i>I am average, but I've set my sights
 on reaching the geniuses.</i>

291
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,870
We at the lab have a name for him:

292
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,340
the Professor of Taste!

293
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,800
Candidate Marui has scored 88 points!

294
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,220
He has second place all to himself!

295
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,350
Marui!

296
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,060
Good job!

297
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:04,680
Professor!

298
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,560
Look, Professor!

299
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,350
Mr. Marui is in second place!

300
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,730
Indeed.

301
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,980
We've seen one high score after the other!

302
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,900
Will this trend continue?

303
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,030
Next is Candidate Ibusa—

304
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,910
In terms of sheer power of fragrance...

305
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,660
this dish may be number one!

306
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,580
Please enjoy my special smoked curry.

307
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,250
The toppings are smoked bacon,

308
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,560
smoked potatoes,

309
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,790
and a smoked egg?!

310
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:35,980
You can't just smoke everything
 and call it a day, Ibusaki!

311
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,670
But it <i>does</i> look really tasty.

312
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,550
<i>D-Don't forget the theme is curry!</i>

313
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:44,090
<i>If you just smoke everything,
 you'll overwhelm the spices.</i>

314
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:53,900
The dish was finished with coarsely ground cinnamon, cumin, cardamon, and cloves.

315
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,360
Applewood wood chips were used
 to cure these ingredients.

316
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,320
I see!

317
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,430
That's how he managed to enhance the spices rather than eclipsing them!

318
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,330
Yes.

319
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,660
Applewood is the best choice for
 working with these spices.

320
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:11,080
These coarsely-ground spices
 were also added to the saumure,

321
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,250
which is used to brine
 ingredients prior to smoking.

322
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,880
This infused the ingredients
 with the curry's flavor.

323
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,880
The toppings are wonderful.

324
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,720
This egg has been turned
 into an umami bomb!

325
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,600
The half-congealed yolk just
 melts in your mouth.

326
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,100
<i>But wait.</i>

327
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,640
<i>How did he achieve cohesion between all the different ingredients?</i>

328
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,190
<i>How did he achieve such unity?</i>

329
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,780
I see! I understand it now!

330
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,070
You used smoked salt in the spice mix!

331
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,160
He smoked the salt?

332
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,450
But how much difference could that make?

333
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,200
I'll have you know I didn't use just any salt.

334
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:53,380
It's seaweed salt, made by burning seaweed with high sodium content, dissolving it in water,

335
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,250
then boiling down the supernatant.

336
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,340
<i>So that's why the flavor is so rounded and mild.</i>

337
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,720
<i>He achieved unity in this curry
 by using smoked salt.</i>

338
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,720
<i>What an astounding boy.</i>

339
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,680
<i>He has a complete grasp of what
 flavors curing can bring to a dish.</i>

340
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,980
<i>Despite his youth, he has the skills to manipulate smoke at will.</i>

341
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,690
You are the...

342
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:19,150
Prince of Smoke!

343
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,940
88 points!

344
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,410
Candidate Ibusaki is now also in second place!

345
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,250
Whoa!

346
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,000
Good job, you two!

347
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,070
I've never seen the two of them like this.

348
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,710
So only now do you reveal your true colors.

349
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,670
Look who's talking.

350
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,630
Finally coming out from behind
 that veil of smoke, are you?

351
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,590
I guess.

352
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,590
Natsume-sama looks like
 she's reached her limits!

353
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,180
Wow!

354
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,340
There are three Polar Star
 members in the top five!

355
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:47,980
Huh?

356
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,930
Wait a second.

357
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,890
Only four get to advance to
 the main tournament, right?

358
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,770
What happens if there are too 
many with the same score?

359
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,230
If these standings still persist
 after the judging is over,

360
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,610
the five judges will vote to determine
 who will proceed to the main tournament.

361
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,820
However...

362
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,610
There are still others.

363
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,620
Next up is Candidate Hayama Akira.

364
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,500
I made an extra portion just for you.

365
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,370
Oh? What a coincidence.

366
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,540
So did I.

367
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,420
Let's have fun comparing.

368
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,000
Sure thing.

369
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,010
<i>Here you go.</i>

370
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,100
<i>Huh?</i>

371
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,810
<i>Um, isn't this...</i>

372
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,880
<i>You got what you came for, so scram!</i>

373
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,180
<i>I'm busy!</i>

374
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,440
<i>What? But...</i>

375
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,810
<i>I figure it's around 30 percent by weight.</i>

376
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,150
<i>You mixed in some poor quality spices, didn't you?</i>

377
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,490
<i>What would a slum rat like you know?</i>

378
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,660
<i>Just try and prove—</i>

379
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,900
<i>I can tell.</i>

380
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,040
<i>My nose is something special.</i>

381
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,450
<i>Are you Chinese?</i>

382
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,080
<i>No, you're Japanese.</i>

383
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,750
<i>Huh?</i>

384
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,710
<i>This is no place for a little girl to go sightseeing.</i>

385
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,840
<i>I'm 26 years old.</i>

386
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,600
<i>Huh?!</i>

387
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:33,350
Candidate Hayama is considered one of the top contenders in these preliminaries!

388
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,970
It's finally his turn to be evaluated!

389
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,680
I believe his dish will be fish head curry.

390
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,770
It's a dynamic dish that uses
 the entire fish's head in—

391
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,810
H-Huh?

392
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,480
Wh-What's this?

393
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,110
It's much more compact than I'd expected.

394
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,070
It's not fish head curry?

395
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:51,530
I believe what's serving as the "lid" is... naan.

396
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,530
Please crack the naan into the bowl with the spoon as you eat.

397
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:00,290
Do take care. It's hot.

398
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,350
<i>It's an explosion... of fragrance!</i>

399
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:28,400
On the next and final episode
 of <i>Shokugeki no Souma</i>,

400
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,360
the twenty-fourth dish:

401
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,510
The Banquet of Warriors.

402
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,700
Enjoy!

403
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,910
Oh, um...

404
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,530
Glad you liked it.
