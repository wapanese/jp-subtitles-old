1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,900
<i>Dad!</i>

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,230
<i>I'm gonna become a chef who can beat you!</i>

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,150
<i>Oh, is that so?</i>

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,490
<i>Well, good luck with that.</i>

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,950
<i>Okay, let's get right to it!</i>

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,700
<i>Let's have a cooking showdown!</i>

7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,160
<i>Since that day, we've had 490 matches.</i>

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,120
<i>Listen up, Souma.</i>

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,280
<i>Until the next time you lose to me,</i>

10
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,790
<i>you'd better not lose to anyone else.</i>

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,180
My creations are still far more
 disgusting than yours, Souma.

12
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,320
She's in fourth place!

13
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,900
She's passed the preliminaries!

14
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,820
In third place is Candidate Takumi Aldini, 90 points!

15
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,740
In second place is Candidate Arato Hisako, 92 points!

16
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,210
And in first place is Candidate Nakiri Alice, 95 points!

17
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,460
These four from Group B will be
 moving on to the main tournament!

18
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,300
Now, let's take a peek at 
what's happening in Group A!

19
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,540
<i>It's an explosion... of fragrance!</i>

20
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,980
<i>So this is Hayama's curry.</i>

21
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,780
That dish packs a serious punch!

22
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,900
I can't believe we can smell
 it all the way up here!

23
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,870
And it stings and prickles your nose!

24
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,160
It's such a rich smell!

25
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,540
Contained by the "lid"...

26
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,170
is a luxurious curry chock-full of
 umami from the grilled fish collar!

27
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,080
Just the aroma by itself makes me so happy.

28
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,170
Man, I really want to try it!

29
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,340
<i>Hayama-kun...</i>

30
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,380
Scoop up a piece of naan along with the curry

31
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,340
and have a bite—

32
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,180
<i>Mere words could not do this justice.</i>

33
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,770
Topping soup with puff pastry was an innovation devised by Paul Bocuse,

34
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,270
one of the preeminent chefs of French cuisine.

35
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:38,360
Bocuse said he was inspired by the lidded
 lacquer bowls used in traditional Japanese cuisine.

36
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,360
The fragrance of the dish is held back by the lid.

37
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,740
When the lid is broken, the fragrance is freed in an explosive burst .

38
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,080
Hayama's weapon is fragrance.

39
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,290
Using it to full effect, he scored
 a direct hit on the judges!

40
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,880
I'm detecting fennel, lemongrass, and cinnamon.

41
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,590
Wait!

42
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,220
There's something else that unites them.

43
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,220
What lies at the center of this strong fragrance?!

44
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,640
Holy basil...

45
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,560
Not only that, it's <i>fresh</i> holy basil!

46
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,810
Holy basil?

47
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,650
It's a spice native to southern Asia that many consider to be sacred.

48
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,980
With one whiff, a most luscious
 sensation courses through your body.

49
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,490
In the Ayurveda tradition, a traditional medicine practiced in India,

50
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:27,120
holy basil is considered to be the elixir of life.

51
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,250
But fresh, high-quality holy basil is all but impossible to find in Japan!

52
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,370
That's true.

53
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,630
Which is why we grow our own
 year-round at Shiomi Lab.

54
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,500
What?

55
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,460
The method by which we cultivate it is a trade secret.

56
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,010
<i>Shiomi...</i>

57
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,550
<i>He must mean Professor Shiomi Jun, a foremost authority on spices.</i>

58
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,470
<i>It's a strong fragrance that sinks
 its claws into you and won't let go.</i>

59
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,850
<i>But that's not his only trick.</i>

60
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,810
<i>What keeps you coming back for more is...</i>

61
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,810
Yogurt?!

62
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,820
That's right, Yukihira.

63
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,160
With a single misstep, holy basil can overwhelm other spices,

64
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,820
but the yogurt mellows it out.

65
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,040
Not to mention, the curcumin compound in spices

66
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:15,450
Roland Chapelle

67
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:15,450
Roland Chapelle

68
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:15,450
Tohtsuki Academy Lecturer
French Cuisine Lead

69
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:15,450
Tohtsuki Academy Lecturer
French Cuisine Lead

70
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,000
Curcumin

71
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,120
aid the liver in its task of detoxification.

72
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,250
Lactobacillus

73
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,290
When ingested along with lactobacilli,

74
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,950
like those commonly found in yogurt,

75
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,550
curcumin is more easily absorbed.

76
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,050
He's even thought the nutritional aspects through!

77
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,260
I knew you could do it, 
Hayama-kun! You're amazing!

78
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:32,600
<i>I didn't expect to meet a chef in Japan who was capable of using holy basil.</i>

79
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,060
Hayama-kun.

80
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,190
Why don't you become mine?

81
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,320
What salary would it take?

82
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,110
A hundred million?

83
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,240
Two hundred?

84
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,610
Name your price—

85
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,910
I fight for Jun.

86
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,830
That's all there is to it.

87
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,790
Mmm, what a manly candidate.

88
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,540
Now I must have you all the more.

89
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,170
<i>With every bite,</i>

90
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,220
<i>the tingling umami pierces
 right through my brain!</i>

91
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,430
<i>I've never encountered
 such a sharp, delicious flavor.</i>

92
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,220
<i>This is perfection in a single dish:</i>

93
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,770
<i>the evolution of modern curry
 reaching its ultimate form!</i>

94
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:24,150
W-Well then, judges, if you would please present your scores.

95
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,360
Guys!

96
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,990
Hey, how was Group B?

97
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,280
I'll tell you later!

98
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
How's it going over here?

99
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,950
What about Yukihira?

100
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,410
Where'd Yukihira place?

101
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,410
Calm down, bro.

102
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,000
It doesn't look like he's been judged yet.

103
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,460
What's Candidate Hayama's score?

104
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,750
Here it is!

105
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,680
Candidate Hayama has jumped
 into the lead with 94 points!

106
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,850
Hayama-kun!

107
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,520
Second place...

108
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,400
I think the princess will be angry.

109
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,770
Well, guess I just need to try
 harder in the main tournament.

110
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,610
Crap, I'm out.

111
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,190
Nikumi!

112
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,070
You did great!

113
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,910
Well done!

114
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,010
Ryouko-chan.

115
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:14,620
Hey, look.

116
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,080
Two judges gave a full 20 points!

117
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,580
Hayama Akira's scary good.

118
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,710
Not even Nakiri Alice received
 full marks from any of the judges.

119
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,130
It's the highlight of the tournament.

120
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,380
Isshiki-san?!

121
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,260
What are you doing here?

122
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,130
What's going on with Group B?!

123
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,050
The rest of the team is wrapping things up.

124
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,960
That was quite the heated battle, wasn't it?

125
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,720
Hold on!

126
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,750
This room is for Autumn Selection staff only—

127
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,870
From a certain point of view, dorm mothers could be counted as staff, no?

128
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,400
Absolutely not!

129
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,320
You're here because you want to see how Souma-kun does, don't you?

130
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,150
What?! As if!

131
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,860
Well, while the arena's still 
feverish from excitement,

132
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,910
it's time for Candidate Yukihira
 Souma to present his dish!

133
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,870
Please serve your dish to the judges!

134
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,410
<i>Souma-kun, what kind of curry did you make?</i>

135
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,500
Here.

136
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,540
This one's for you, Hayama.

137
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,080
What's with that smug look?

138
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,750
<i>A month ago you didn't even
 know about kari patta,</i>

139
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,050
<i>one of the most fundamental
 spices used in curry.</i>

140
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,340
<i>So how can you still be smiling
 after tasting my creation?</i>

141
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:19,780
Oh, I was just thinking how
 my idea wasn't so crazy after all.

142
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,350
<i>What on earth...</i>

143
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,100
<i>An omelette?!</i>

144
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,730
Huh?

145
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,940
Wasn't the transfer student making a risotto?

146
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,860
Dig in.

147
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,610
Fragrance explosion...

148
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,530
take two!

149
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:44,750
Wow, there's a risotto inside the omelette!

150
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,920
The fragrance that was trapped inside
 has been released in an explosive burst!

151
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,340
Right after Hayama's dish...

152
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,470
...another fragrance bomb makes a direct hit!

153
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,430
You had the same idea as I did?

154
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,430
It seems that way, doesn't it?

155
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,770
It's hot, so be careful!

156
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,150
Curry Risotto Omelette Rice, 
carefully made by Yukihira!

157
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,900
The rice enclosed by the egg is glistening

158
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,160
like the rice in a don bowl coated with the highest quality sauce.

159
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,580
Amazing.

160
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,490
What a rich fragrance.

161
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,500
You can't help but smile after a whiff of it.

162
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,620
I'm anticipating something as
 great as Hayama-kun's curry.

163
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,670
Now, then...

164
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,400
<i>What impact!</i>

165
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,520
<i>Strike after flavorful strike!</i>

166
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,730
Yeah!

167
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,690
<i>A rich bouillon made from
 chicken bones and beef tendon.</i>

168
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,990
<i>Umami from the ground beef and onions, sauteed in butter, suffuses the rice.</i>

169
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,570
<i>The creamy risotto is in perfect harmony with the impeccably cooked egg.</i>

170
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,450
I feel like I'm going to faint from pleasure!

171
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,200
It seems this sauce is the clincher.

172
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,000
Based on oyster sauce,
 it's been accented with honey.

173
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,290
The mild acidity adds 
more depth to the sauce.

174
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,920
The sauce and the risotto create <i>two</i> different layers of flavor!

175
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,220
I understand now.

176
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,090
Hayama-kun's curry was a massive
 explosion that catches you off guard,

177
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,220
but this dish continues to send out shockwaves of fragrance.

178
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,890
The outer and inner fragrances are mingling intermittently to seduce you!

179
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,060
<i>But that's not the only source
 of the depth of this dish.</i>

180
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,400
<i>This fragrance and faint bitterness...</i>

181
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,650
<i>comes from cumin and cardamom.</i>

182
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,820
<i>There's cloves too, which cause
a faint tingle on the tongue.</i>

183
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,490
<i>I've sniffed out the edges of this mystery,</i>

184
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,620
<i>but I've only scratched the surface.</i>

185
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,370
<i>What's the secret that brings all these spices together to produce this depth of flavor?</i>

186
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,080
<i>So that's it. Mango.</i>

187
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,330
Mango chutney.

188
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,670
Mango chutney?!

189
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,090
How can that create such a complex taste?

190
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,970
Chutney is something like a paste, right?

191
00:10:58,970 --> 00:10:59,970
Yeah.

192
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,300
It's a condiment made by mashing up
 spices with fruits and vegetables,

193
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,850
then simmering the mixture down.

194
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,930
There are countless chutneys across Asia,
 differing in the ingredients used.

195
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:13,110
Some are sweet or spicy,
 while others use mint.

196
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,900
This is my house blend mango chutney.

197
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,280
I added it while I was simmering the rice.

198
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,910
The mango harmonizes the
 flavors of each individual spice

199
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,540
to create an even richer
 depth of flavor in the dish.

200
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,660
You could call it an applied
 technique for spicing dishes.

201
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,040
In India, chutney is served on the side.

202
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,500
It's just another condiment.

203
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,590
Adding chutney to the curry
 itself is unique to Japan.

204
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,240
Huh.

205
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,260
I had no idea.

206
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,430
From a purist's perspective,
 this breaks with tradition.

207
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,720
However, in doing so...

208
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,390
...he avoided going overboard with adding fats and animal products to the dish.

209
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,690
But he still elevated the dish's
 flavor to another dimension!

210
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,980
<i>In the recent past,</i>

211
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,650
<i>Yukihira-kun made a major error with an egg dish.</i>

212
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,900
His training camp omelette almost cost him his spot at the academy.

213
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,110
And his risotto lost completely
 to his father's dish.

214
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,370
Yet he chose to bring those two dishes together in this match.

215
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,700
<i>His father?</i>

216
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,500
He hasn't wasted a single failure,

217
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,380
not in any of the 490 defeats he's suffered.

218
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,290
Hmph.

219
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,590
It sounds so noble when you put it like that,

220
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,590
but maybe he just doesn't
 know when to give up.

221
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,970
He isn't one to let a failure stay a failure.

222
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,640
Yukihira may <i>look</i> like he can keep his cool,

223
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,760
but he is the ultimate sore loser.

224
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,230
<i>I did learn something from my mistake.</i>

225
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,480
<i>That's what a loser says to cover up his failure.</i>

226
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,650
<i>Failure is not an option for chefs!</i>

227
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,320
This umami is weighty and rock solid.

228
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,070
Yet the aftertaste is surprisingly light!

229
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,780
Is this again due to the chutney?

230
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,960
But Hayama-kun's dish had a richer fragrance.

231
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,250
No, wait!

232
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,580
When you mix the sauce into the rice,
the force of the flavor is magnificent!

233
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,190
One might imagine Hayama-kun's curry

234
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,840
as a sharp poleaxe with holy basil as its shaft.

235
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,050
<i>This</i> curry emanates its attack in waves.

236
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,010
Its taste is a flurry of combo attacks!

237
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,220
Both of them are using their weapons of choice,

238
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,930
attacking each other in their
 own way, with all their might!

239
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:28,280
This is a battle between those who aim for the pinnacle of Tohtsuki!

240
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,370
Hey, that was no faint praise there.

241
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,710
Will the transfer student actually 
surpass Hayama Akira?

242
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,880
Well then, judges, your scores please!

243
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,480
18!

244
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,900
19!

245
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,320
18!

246
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,480
19! 19!

247
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,240
The total score is...

248
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,910
93 points!

249
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:12,280
Candidate Yukihira is in second
 place with 93 points!

250
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh man, so close.

251
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Off by just one point?!

252
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,080
93 points.

253
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,120
Yukihira...

254
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,170
Second place, huh.

255
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,160
A tie.

256
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,840
Yukihira... Souma.

257
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,560
Well, I guess a transfer student
 couldn't have taken the top spot.

258
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,580
Hayama's like curry personified.

259
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,350
W-Wait, those scores...

260
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,530
Of the five judges,

261
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,260
three gave Yukihira more points than Hayama.

262
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,190
Hayama Akira 94 points

263
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,190
Hayama Akira 94 points

264
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,190
Yukihira Souma 93 points

265
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,190
Yukihira Souma 93 points

266
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,190
That's three to two.

267
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:48,150
If this had followed the rules of a Cooking Battle...

268
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:53,440
Gentlemen, how can you fail to appreciate
 the incredible work of art that is that curry?

269
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,880
How can you not appreciate 
the advantage of holy basil?

270
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,130
But the matter at hand is the curry dish.

271
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,750
It's not merely about judging
 their selection of spices.

272
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,700
What's important is how satisfying
the dish is as a whole.

273
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,240
Hayama-kun's curry was superior
 in that respect as well!

274
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,590
But it was Candidate Yukihira's dish that I wanted more and more of—

275
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,930
Shut up! You're just an extra!

276
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,200
You're being too emotional.

277
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,660
One who lacks multidimensional perspective has no right to speak about gourmet food!

278
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,320
Why don't you resign as a judge?

279
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,650
What did you just say?!

280
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,400
Um, stop! Please calm down!

281
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,690
Intellectual poseurs are nothing but trouble!

282
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,890
Shut up, mustache!

283
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:31,070
Please! Please calm down!

284
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,590
They seem to be arguing,

285
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,180
but Hayama's in first place all the same, right?

286
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:31,820
I think so.

287
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,200
<i>He survived for now.</i>

288
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:38,400
<i>I'm looking forward to the main 
tournament, Yukihira Souma.</i>

289
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,980
Hayama-kun!

290
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,090
You're amazing, Hayama-kun!

291
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:46,060
<i>In the main tournament, there can only be two outcomes: win or lose.</i>

292
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,260
<i>If those two end up facing each other,</i>

293
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,010
<i>who will win?</i>

294
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,860
The 92nd class...

295
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,480
A generation full of diamonds in the rough.

296
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,290
All right, let's celebrate...

297
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,670
the conclusion of the Autumn 
Selection Preliminaries

298
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:27,390
with a party for a job well done!

299
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,670
So...

300
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,130
Cheers!

301
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,090
Megumi!

302
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,980
Megumi!

303
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,060
Megumi!

304
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,040
Megumi!

305
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,740
Well, now...

306
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,740
That was amazing, Megumi!

307
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,240
Maybe you'll win the whole kit and caboodle!

308
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,510
Wh-What're you talking about?

309
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,230
Tadokoro Megumi.

310
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,720
Houjou-san.

311
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,690
I had you all wrong.

312
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,160
I'll be cheering for you at the main tournament.

313
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,460
What?

314
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,620
If you need any help, just give me a holler.

315
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,860
Thank you, Houjou-san.

316
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:08,110
I knew you were awesome, Megumi!

317
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,000
Yuuki-chan.

318
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:13,880
I'll be your head cheerleader
 at the main tournament!

319
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,360
Thanks.

320
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,340
Hey, Megumi!

321
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,350
Let's take a group photo!

322
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,840
Go on. They're calling for you.

323
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,560
Oh, okay.

324
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,600
Yuuki.

325
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,220
Fumio-san!

326
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,940
Thank you for cheering me on!

327
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,940
It's gonna get really busy!

328
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,690
We have to make a banner
 for Megumi and stuff.

329
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,230
Please help us, Fumio-san!

330
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,360
I'll make your favorite tonight.

331
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,740
It was a good dish.

332
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,830
You did well.

333
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,260
Whoa!

334
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,030
That's really high-quality duck meat!

335
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,310
Good job!

336
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,670
You could tell just by looking?

337
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,880
Huh.

338
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,590
Rice malt has that effect too?

339
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,470
That's very interesting.

340
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,460
Isn't it deep?

341
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,690
Still, I didn't know Marui had
 a cheerleading squad.

342
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,600
Yeah, my opinion of him
 has completely changed.

343
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,900
But you guys <i>still</i> insist
 on partying in my room.

344
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,900
Here!

345
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,160
Dig in, all of you.

346
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,360
O-Okay.

347
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,660
Thank you for inviting us, Isshiki-san.

348
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,610
Here!

349
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,140
<i>There's a man wandering around
 dressed only in an apron.</i>

350
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,330
<i>Why is no one saying anything?</i>

351
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,670
Say, where's Ibusaki-kun?

352
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,290
I bet he's holed up in his room.

353
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,770
He won't show it,

354
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,210
but I think he was really frustrated.

355
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,590
I guess it's up to me to go
 and drag him out here.

356
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,050
The main tournament is two weeks from now.

357
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,960
It'll decide which of the first-years,
 minus Nakiri Erina,

358
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,500
is the best chef at the academy.

359
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,090
Listen up, Yukihira!

360
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:53,040
I'll never forgive you if you lose
 before we get to face off!

361
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,880
Sure, fine by me.

362
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,300
Come at me!

363
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,410
Hey, Jun.

364
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,560
Getting all drunk by yourself and passing out...

365
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,790
This is even worse than usual.

366
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,500
Whatever.

367
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:13,370
Hayama-kun, you might change the world.

368
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,340
<i>Jun, I'll win the main tournament too.</i>

369
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,720
<i>All for you...</i>

370
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,230
<i>the one who found me.</i>

371
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,190
Hey!

372
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,790
Why can't you come play
 with me for just one night?!

373
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,760
Your own cousin passed the prelims with the highest score, you know!

374
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,010
It's your responsibility to celebrate.

375
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,090
Ryou-kun, don't you agree?

376
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,860
I have no opinion.

377
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,530
Hey!

378
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,900
You're supposed to back me up here, Ryou-kun!

379
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,740
Oh, my apologies.

380
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,580
I still have some paperwork left to do tonight.

381
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,670
I'll have to take a rain check on the festivities.

382
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,210
Hmph.

383
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,420
Fine. I'll give up for tonight.

384
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,880
But I'll be back tomorrow.

385
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,760
Let's go, Ryou-kun.

386
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,380
'Kay.

387
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,300
Congratulations on passing.

388
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,300
That goes for you too, Kurokiba-kun.

389
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,220
Thanks.

390
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,650
My apologies.

391
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,370
I did inform them that you were busy.

392
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,730
It was unavoidable.

393
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:11,690
It's Alice, after all.

394
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,650
Hisako, congratulations to you too.

395
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,580
Though I of course <i>expected</i> you
 to pass the preliminaries,

396
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,360
I'm still glad.

397
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,050
Do your best in the main tournament as well.

398
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,010
<i>I will!</i>

399
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:26,530
<i>I'll hone my skills even further
 and win without fail!</i>

400
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,500
Hisako-onee-sama...

401
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,540
<i>The fragrance that came wafting from that dish...</i>

402
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,460
Here and now, I'm starting a new life

406
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:46,970
I'll transcend the sky I used to look up at

408
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,010
Well, well? Well, well?

Hope turned out to be inside

Don't come any closer!

412
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:52,480
Doesn't it look tasty?

413
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,610
Doesn't it look tasty?

414
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,610
The hand that was clenched so firmly

415
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,610

416
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:57,650

Doesn't it look tasty?

418
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,820
It's disgusting!

419
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:07,530
I realized that the landscape spreading out

Hey, Tadokoro.

430
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,040
What's up?

431
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:29,300
There are so many things I don't know that I can't help but laugh

432
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:29,300

Um...

434
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,710
I just thought you didn't
 look yourself, that's all.

435
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:35,680
That means I can still grow much further

436

00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,970
Yeah?

438
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,680
Anyway, I heard you used local ingredients
 from your hometown in your curry.

439
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,780
Huh? Yeah.

440
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:41,190
I'm striding forward

Nicely done!

443
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,400
But it still hasn't really sunk in.

444
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,680
Six months ago, I was about to get expelled.

445
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:46,530
Never surrendering my true feelings

Toward a faraway peak

My first class was when we first paired up, right?

451
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:53,020
It's all thanks to you, Souma-kun.

452
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,830

Nah, you had it in you from the start.

458
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:05,510
I opened the way fearlessly

It warms you up inside, y'know?

462
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:11,050
Looking for a new scenery

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,850
What're they talking about?

469
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,360
Wait. Why am I hiding in the shadows?

470
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,310
I just do what comes naturally

They seem to be having a moment.

474
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,380
Whoa!

475
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,190
Souma-kun, you were amazing too.

476
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:31,870
You were Hayama-kun's equal,
 even though he's a curry specialist.

477
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,950
But I was one point short.

478
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,040
I went in gunning to win.

479
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,820
I wanted to get 20 points from all five of them.

480
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,250
O-Oh, I see.

481
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,890
Hayama took advantage of a spice
 I didn't even know about

482
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:52,010
Tasting so many of both sweet and bitter days

483
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:52,010
amai hi wo nigai hi wo abinagara

484
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,180

485
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,640
I want to learn a whole lot more about the culinary world.

486
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:59,770

00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,560
experience real cooking, expand my repertoire,

490
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,730
and leverage all of it in my future dishes.

491
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:04,940

We're starting the second round!

Drink up, Ibusaki! It's rice juice!

511
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,510
You're laying it on real thick.

519

When he's shaking like that,
 you should just leave him alone.

520
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:46,820

I-I'm so sorry, Nikumi-san!

534
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:04,840
That means I can still grow much further

535
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:04,840
madamada saki ni ikeru akashi da

536
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,460
Don't call me Nikumi!

537
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,420
The only one who can call me that is...

538
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:10,170
I'm striding forward

539
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:10,170
oikaketeta haruka tooku

540
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,080
You bastard, look at what you're making me say!

541
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,460
You asshole!

542
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:15,680
Never surrendering my true feelings

543
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:15,680
yuzurenai omoi mo tsurete

544
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:15,470
All right, let me make a dish
 to cheer everyone up.

545
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,430
I don't like the look in his eyes!

546
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:21,190
Toward a faraway peak

547
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:21,190
daremo shiranai itadaki wo

548
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,080
Yukihira, stay put!

549
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,600
You don't have to make anything, Souma-kun!

550
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,810
That no one knows about

551
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,810
mezashite iku

552
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,440
But I've already made it, see?

553
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,860
With everything on the line

554
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,860
subete kakete

555
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,400
Dig in!

556
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,070
It's squid tentacles with yogurt.

557
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,360
Oh, God!

558
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,240
Not again!

559
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,980
Thank you for the food!
