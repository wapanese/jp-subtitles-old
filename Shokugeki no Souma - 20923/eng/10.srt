1
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,190
If you cannot finish serving our guests' dinners within the next sixty minutes,

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,980
you will be expelled on the spot.

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,620
I'm not done yet! Not done!

4
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,500
Fifty's nothing to sneeze at.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,460
<i>Fifty!</i>

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,050
Here you go!

7
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,010
Finally, girl!

8
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,970
Wow, it's delicious!

9
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,470
I could eat this all day!

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,190
<i>Thank goodness. I'm glad they're eating a lot.</i>

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,240
It's not greasy at all!

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,110
It's not overcooked, either!

13
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,230
Great! Delicious!

14
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,110
I want seconds and thirds!

15
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:54,530
<i>All right!</i>

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,030
<i>I'm going to try even harder!</i>

17
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,850
Oops, sorry.

18
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,690
Y-Yukihira Souma!

19
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,150
You all right, Nakiri?

20
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,280
Did you twist your ankle or anything?

21
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,280
Don't touch me!

22
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,780
I can get up without your help!

23
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,990
<i>What a blunder!</i>

24
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,240
<i>I let my guard down because I thought I was alone.</i>

25
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,080
<i>And </i>he<i> saw me like this, of all people!</i>

26
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,960
<i>I hope he didn't hear me.</i>

27
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,960
You seem to be in a really good mood, what with the humming and all.

28
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,130
Humming?! Who, me?!

29
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,560
What are you talking about?!

30
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,840
<i>So he </i>did<i> hear me!</i>

31
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,430
Well, I do get why you're so cheerful.

32
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,050
Here we are, staying a few nights at a hot spring.

33
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,600
I even brought cards and other stuff to play with.

34
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,180
<i>I'm not cheerful at all!</i>

35
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,270
I'm not like you.

36
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,190
I'd been told this is supposed
 to be a camp straight out of hell,

37
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,820
but I find it to be a boring, pointless excursion.

38
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,940
On the other hand, getting to see you expelled

39
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,200
may prove to have some entertainment value.

40
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,410
Sure, whatever.

41
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,490
You were <i>totally</i> enjoying yourself just now.

42
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,710
Erina-sama!

43
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,610
I'm sorry I took so long!

44
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,290
It was more work than I'd anticipated—

45
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,670
Y-Yukihira Souma!

46
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,380
What are you doing here?!

47
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,890
Oh, I pushed Nakiri down on the floor.

48
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,850
Oh, no!

49
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,560
What?!

50
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,980
Don't make it sound like something it wasn't!

51
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,230
But I did, didn't I?

52
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,600
I made you go all "boing" and stuff.

53
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,770
Boing?!

54
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,810
Th-That's not true, Hisako!

55
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,640
God! Just get out of my sight already!

56
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,780
Fine, fine.

57
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,740
Bathy bath, plungy plunge.

58
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,660
Is everything all right?

59
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,370
Yes!

60
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,750
Go take your bath.

61
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,210
Okay.

62
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,380
Oh, I managed to borrow them 
from the front desk.

63
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,000
Cards!

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,420
I would never waste my time
 on something so frivolous!

65
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,050
Uh, what?

66
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,970
But Erina-sama, earlier...

67
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,720
<i>Say, Hisako.</i>

68
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,300
<i>Do you think they have cards here?</i>

69
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:48,970
<i>What?</i>

70
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,930
<i>Cards. Playing cards.</i>

71
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,930
<i>Cards? You want to play cards?</i>

72
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,520
<i>We can play together, can't we?</i>

73
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,690
<i>You're right.</i>

74
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,230
<i>I'll try asking the front desk.</i>

75
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,690
Isn't that what you said?

76
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,490
I absolutely did <i>not</i> !

77
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,660
Is something the matter?

78
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,320
No, there is not!

79
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,580
Man, what's with her?

80
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,040
I still don't get what her deal is.

81
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,540
Oh, well.

82
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,580
Gonna take my sweet time in the bath.

83
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,590
First one in, here I come!

84
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,720
Uh...

85
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,510
Oh?

86
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,930
The first student's here already?

87
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,930
Sorry. Stretching in the bath 
is part of my daily routine.

88
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,190
At that moment, a thought formed in Souma's mind.

89
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,270
<i>He's freakin' scary!</i>

90
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,400
A thought that rarely occurred to him.

91
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,520
But it was only for a moment.

92
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,130
Man, and I was all revved up thinking I'd be the first one here.

93
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,740
What a letdown!

94
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,160
Sorry about that.

95
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,120
You'll have to settle for being the first student here.

96
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,960
I have to say, between last year and this year,

97
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,750
the academy has some very 
good students in the pipeline.

98
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,960
Last year?

99
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,090
The task of preparing fifty servings has been 
assigned simultaneously at multiple locations.

100
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,930
It's obvious who completed that task the fastest.

101
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,260
Every year, I try to finish my bath
 and leave before students show up.

102
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,310
But last year, there was a student
 who finished and showed up early too.

103
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,020
<i>Oh?</i>

104
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,820
He's now the seventh seat in the Elite Ten.

105
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,400
<i>Someone I'm quite familiar with.</i>

106
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,320
He seemed promising as well.

107
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,530
<i>That sounds like Isshiki-senpai all right.</i>

108
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,290
<i>Hm?</i>

109
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:42,750
<i>Wait, she finished even earlier than I did?</i>

110
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,170
Speed isn't everything, of course,

111
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,340
but it does say something about one's skills.

112
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,930
Thank you.

113
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:52,640
You're welcome.

114
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,550
Oh, Hisako.

115
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:54,890
Actually...

116
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:59,390
<i>I even brought cards and other stuff to play with.</i>

117
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,310
I don't need them after all.

118
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,480
Okay.

119
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,980
Nakiri Erina,

120
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,940
granddaughter of the academy's director.

121
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,600
The God Tongue.

122
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:15,490
All of the academy's senior lecturers
have been at her disposal since her infancy.

123
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,380
<i>So-so.</i>

124
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,210
She would refuse to eat anything except the most exquisitely made baby food.

125
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,890
Once when she was a child, she was made to taste several varieties of salt while blindfolded.

126
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,220
<i>Shoudo Island, Kagawa Prefecture.</i>

127
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,690
<i>Noto Peninsula, Ishikawa Prefecture.</i>

128
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,900
<i>Kuroshio City, Kouchi Prefecture.</i>

129
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,820
She correctly identified each salt's origin.

130
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,780
There are more stories than I can count about her God Tongue.

131
00:07:54,570 --> 00:08:00,250
However, her ascendance as the youngest member 
of the Elite Ten is founded on true talent.

132
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,710
If she continues at that level,

133
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,380
she will become Tohtsuki's greatest masterpiece, a true monster.

134
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,760
But she's still a diamond in the rough.

135
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,880
Tohtsuki is a hellish place,

136
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,500
where those with talent throng
and devour one another.

137
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,560
Its depths are unfathomable.

138
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,890
Sharpen your fangs, boy!

139
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,350
Yes, sir.

140
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,650
Yukihira!

141
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,650
You may have finished before me this time,

142
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,900
but I won't let that happen—

143
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,030
Chef Doujima?!

144
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,450
Ah, it seems I've soaked for too long.

145
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,990
I should get going.

146
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,660
At any event,

147
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,620
the camp is just beginning.

148
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,000
Be sure to take care of yourself physically.

149
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,830
Good luck.

150
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,830
Thanks, Doujima-senpai.

151
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,760
D-D...

152
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,430
Do you know who he is?!

153
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,510
Yeah, he's Doujima-senpai.

154
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,600
You're right, but— Wait, that's not what I mean!

155
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,540
How could you nonchalantly
shake hands with him, Yukihira?!

156
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,560
Hm?

157
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,140
<i>Yukihira?</i>

158
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,110
<i>I've heard that name before.</i>

159
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,450
Man, preparing fifty servings was exhausting!

160
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm glad we all made it.

161
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,290
This is what the next four days will be like.

162
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,960
They didn't call it the camp from hell for nothing.

163
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,840
But when you're soaking in a hot bath,

164
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,710
you find the energy to fight another day.

165
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,470
You brought that with you?

166
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,050
I thought I should let him see the world.

167
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,680
Phew.

168
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,390
Still...

169
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,140
Wh-What?

170
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,640
You're as audacious as ever,

171
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,690
aren't you, Sakaki-dono?

172
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,320
Maybe the rice malt's working some magic.

173
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,690
Don't <i>you</i> start in on my bust too, Megumi.

174
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,690
Look, it's seeing the world.

175
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,280
Aw, silly boy.

176
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,240
Well, then.

177
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,750
Time to get going!

178
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,920
Let's see the room that'd normally cost us 80,000 yen per night!

179
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,390
Wow!

180
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,510
Yeah!

181
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,510
Why don't you try it out too, Megumi?

182
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,980
It's so fancy that I feel like
 I'd jinx myself if I touched anything.

183
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,770
Fancy-schmancy!

184
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,690
Yuuki, you're embarrassing yourself.

185
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,900
I know you're happy, but...

186
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,440
U-Um...

187
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,900
Oh, Marui-kun.

188
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,490
You look a little wasted.

189
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,660
Do I?

190
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,950
Then why don't you hear what I have to say?

191
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,370
Let's call it a day and get some rest for tomorrow.

192
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,510
We're here!

193
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,500
Let's play!

194
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,380
Why do you guys keep coming to my room?!

195
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,130
All right!

196
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,210
What should we do?

197
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,380
Daihinmin! 100 games!

198
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,680
F-Fine. It's on!

199
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,140
Two minutes and fifteen seconds.

200
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,060
Their exhaustion overwhelmed them the moment they eased up.

201
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,110
Well, we can let them be till lights out.

202
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,600
You're not sleepy, Megumi?

203
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,990
That's not like you.

204
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,070
You usually go to sleep early.

205
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,370
Yeah, it's weird.

206
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,490
I'm tired, but I'm still wide awake.

207
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,790
Well, you've been super focused the whole day.

208
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,210
That's true.

209
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,920
But that's probably not the only reason.

210
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,170
I'm always so nervous in class.

211
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,380
I'm anxious the whole time,
 worrying about messing up.

212
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,430
But today, I managed to back 
Souma-kun up just fine.

213
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,020
<i>Glad you liked it!</i>

214
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,350
So just a bit, just a tiny bit,

215
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,860
I'm starting to believe in myself.

216
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,730
And I'm kind of excited about that.

217
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,820
But, you know, it's because Souma-kun gave me such good instructions!

218
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,330
I really didn't do anything special!

219
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,340
That's not true.

220
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,600
I couldn't have made that dish if you
 hadn't gathered the right ingredients,

221
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,040
and you cooked everything just fine.

222
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,250
He's right.

223
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,420
You're totally capable of rising to the occasion.

224
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,550
Be more confident, okay?

225
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,430
Sixteen cups!

226
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,470
Wow!

227
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,760
Amazing!

228
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,450
Ultra fast rotation!

229
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,480
Let me try too!

230
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,140
Here it comes! Here it comes!

231
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,350
Let me try!

232
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,350
<i>I want to continue to be with them.</i>

233
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,360
<i>I want to improve my cooking.</i>

234
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,360
<i>I'm going to try my best.</i>

235
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,000
You're fired.

236
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,300
Good morning.

237
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,720
I'm Shinomiya, an alumnus 
of the 79th graduating class.

238
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,370
This task involves preparing a dish of my choosing.

239
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,690
You all have the <i>recette</i>, I hope?

240
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,940
Shit, it's Chef Shinomiya.

241
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,940
I heard he expelled over thirty students yesterday.

242
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,410
And he's assigned a recipe
 that <i>he</i> came up with.

243
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,160
Terrine of Nine Vegetables.

244
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,370
Though visually arresting with its nine vibrant vegetables,

245
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,710
each vegetable requires its own
specific preparation and cooking time,

246
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:42,680
and none must overwhelm or 
underwhelm its counterparts.

247
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,340
It is a herculean task to bring
 all nine flavors together.

248
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,630
I chose one of my easier recettes.

249
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,520
Would you prefer something
 more challenging instead?

250
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,280
<i>Damn him.</i>

251
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,810
<i>I want to punch him.</i>

252
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,450
"Recette"?

253
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,940
It's the French word for recipe.

254
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,150
Oh.

255
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,860
Also,

256
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,900
you will not be working in teams for this task.

257
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,110
Each of you must prepare the dish individually.

258
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,870
You may not share information
 or help each other during this task.

259
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,250
You will each choose your ingredients from the piles at the back of the kitchen.

260
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,290
Lastly, a word of advice.

261
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:25,510
You would do well to think of
 everyone else as your enemies.

262
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,680
You have three hours.

263
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,840
Now...

264
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,300
begin.

265
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,730
Ow! Get out of my way!

266
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,940
Screw that! I'll kill you!

267
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,780
Outta the way!

268
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,490
<i>Everyone's wild-eyed.</i>

269
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,910
<i>The tension's even worse than yesterday.</i>

270
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,370
<i>But I can't be scared.</i>

271
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,330
<i>I'm not going to let this get to me!</i>

272
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,550
Okay!

273
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,550
Okay!

274
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,300
All right!

275
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,760
Um...

276
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,720
This one!

277
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,980
<i>I'm lagging behind everyone else,</i>

278
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,100
<i>but all I need now is some cauliflower.</i>

279
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,530
<i>Not this one, this one, or this one!</i>

280
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,280
<i>This slight discoloration...</i>

281
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,990
<i>All the ones that are left are in early stages of oxidization!</i>

282
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,310
<i>If I cook them as is,</i>

283
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,870
<i>the discoloration will become more pronounced,</i>

284
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,080
<i>and the terrine's appearance, 
a critical element of the dish, will suffer!</i>

285
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,960
<i>Wh-What should I do?</i>

286
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,920
<i>Souma-kun—</i>

287
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,300
<i>You may not share information nor help each other during this task.</i>

288
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,800
<i>I can't.</i>

289
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,260
<i>I can't rely on Souma-kun all the time.</i>

290
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,600
<i>I have to figure this out on my own!</i>

291
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,690
<i>How can I preserve the cauliflower's color?</i>

292
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,320
<i>I've got it!</i>

293
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,470
Hey, that's not what the recette says, is it?

294
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:23,960
Huh?

295
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,130
Oh, you're right.

296
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,420
You two, over there.

297
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,670
I told you before.

298
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,050
Sharing information or
 helping each other is not allowed.

299
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,720
Did you miss what I said?

300
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,470
I-I didn't do anything like that!

301
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,550
He's right.

302
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:40,100
All he did was point out my small mistake.

303
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,980
So he did help you.

304
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,480
You've failed.

305
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,530
Both of you are fired.

306
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,180
Start over!

307
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,170
You're fired.

308
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,040
Good job.

309
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,440
P-Please!

310
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,390
I'll...

311
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,470
I'll make it over!

312
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,540
Do you have any ingredients?

313
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,090
You do not.

314
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,570
And time's almost up.

315
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:57,430
If you can remake the dish, you're a greater magician than I could ever hope to be.

316
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,390
Fired!

317
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:02,390
Fired.

318
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,100
Yukihira Souma.

319
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,310
Oh?

320
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,910
You pass.

321
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,260
I'm done!

322
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,220
The Terrine of Nine Vegetables!

323
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,180
I'm almost out of time!

324
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,400
You're the last one.

325
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,240
T-Tadokoro Megumi.

326
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,870
Thank you for having me!

327
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,640
Tadokoro Megumi.

328
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,390
You're fired.

329
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,240
That concludes our session.

330
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,870
Those who passed should 
prepare for the afternoon—

331
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,370
E-Excuse me!

332
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,990
Why?

333
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,500
Why was my dish unacceptable?

334
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,620
Ah.

335
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,960
You used wine vinegar when you boiled the oxidized cauliflower, didn't you?

336
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,920
You maintained its pristine color by using vinegar, which has a whitening effect.

337
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,850
Using vinegar in the seasoning also 
enhanced the cauliflower's sweetness.

338
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,310
The sweetness of the vegetables and the vinegar's mild acidity

339
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,020
are in perfect harmony.

340
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,600
Th-Then why?

341
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,110
Who said you could change the recette?

342
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,190
This dish is intended to display the harmony created by the sweetness of each vegetable.

343
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:27,630
Nowhere in the recette did it say 
to make use of acidity.

344
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,960
The dish you made is an entirely different beast.

345
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,540
Presenting a dish that does not align with the task
 merits a fail as a matter of course.

346
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,550
I hope that answer suffices.

347
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,050
It doesn't.

348
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,470
It was what you'd call an unavoidable accident.

349
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,430
There were ingredients that weren't fresh.

350
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,430
Besides, aren't we being treated as our senpais' employees during this time?

351
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,440
As our boss, managing the ingredients is your responsibility, Shinomiya-senpai.

352
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,570
Wouldn't that make this <i>your</i> fault as the chef?

353
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,280
You brat.

354
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,280
Who do you think you're talking to?

355
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,490
You don't seem to get it, 
so I'll explain it to you.

356
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:15,710
I added poor-quality cauliflowers on purpose 
to limit the number of people who would pass!

357
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:24,670
Cauliflower is an ingredient that oxidizes quickly,
 is easily damaged, and is difficult to prepare.

358
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:32,140
Any idiot who lost their cool and made a poor selection would fail.

359
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,190
That includes any laggards who fell behind
 and couldn't secure a better one.

360
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,650
That's why Tadokoro tried to
 compensate by being creative!

361
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,490
<i>I</i> am the chef here.

362
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:49,280
Underlings like you have no right to make changes to <i>my</i> recette!

363
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,330
Listen up, underling.

364
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,080
If you refuse to back down,

365
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:58,960
I can fire you too, on my authority as a chef.

366
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,510
What?!

367
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,170
Souma-kun, it's okay!

368
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,710
I'm fine.

369
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:07,630
You'll get expelled too.

370
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,340
Okay?

371
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,260
So stop.

372
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,140
Huh?!

373
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,010
I don't care about that crap right now!

374
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,180
Really, it's okay.

375
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:19,940
Don't... Don't worry about me, so...

376
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,990
Shinomiya-senpai, I'm sorry to bother you,

377
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,370
but there's one more thing.

378
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,960
What now, Monsieur Yukihira?

379
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,580
Do you have another complaint?

380
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,830
No, it's a question, not a complaint.

381
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,710
Does that Tohtsuki rule apply to alumni too?

382
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,590
What are you talking about?

383
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,470
Cooking Battles.

384
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,680
If I beat you in a Cooking Battle,

385
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,190
will you rescind Tadokoro's expulsion?

386
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,960
Next time on <i>Shokugeki no Souma</i>,

387
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,580
the eleventh dish.

388
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,000
Are you okay, Marui?

389
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,000
The Magician from the East.

390
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,310
Ibusaki's never off.

391
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,010
Nope.
