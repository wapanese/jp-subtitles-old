1
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,980
Good morning, Night City! Rise and shine
for a new day in the City of Dreams…

2
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,530
Got reports of a pile-up
on the Heywood highway.

3
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,360
We've got gonks dreaming of
becoming the next Weyland Boa Boa

4
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,370
jamming up traffic for the rest of us!

5
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:07,580
…gangoons swarming like flies! What is it
about this City that keeps attracting…

6
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,750
Never fear the risk!

7
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,960
You'll never make it big
dreaming quiet, dreaming small.

8
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,800
Wanna know where
all the legends of Night City play?

9
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,220
It's…

10
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,140
Maine.

11
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,640
When's the last time you ate?

12
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:40,320
You're shaking. All that chrome's
messing with your nerves.

13
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,280
When this's over, you gotta refit.
Go lightspec, reduce your load.

14
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,540
Just some jitters.
Don't make it a big deal.

15
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,370
Shit, at this rate…

16
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,630
A lil' metal ain't gonna…

17
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,550
Maine?

18
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,970
Hey! Maine!

19
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,550
Fuck off!
No one's gonna set my limits but me!

20
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,560
I made it this far without any trouble.

21
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,930
I ain't gonna turn back now!

22
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,430
Where's the fucking data?!

23
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,940
You know Kiwi's diving for it!

24
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,030
ICE is thicker than I expected…

25
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,380
Maine! Stop! What're you…

26
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,300
Hey!

27
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,510
Kiwi? Falco?

28
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,310
You back with us? Shit…

29
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:49,810
Dorio?

30
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,690
What gives? We get jumped?

31
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,110
What happened to Kiwi…

32
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,110
…forecast for heavy rainfall on the coast.

33
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,700
Districts like Santo Domingo
and Westbrook,

34
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:10,250
are bound to see showers
from midnight to sunrise--

35
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,710
What the fuck, Falco?!

36
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,710
Ask Maine? Just tell me…

37
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,130
Yo!

38
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,420
Huh…?

39
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,510
I won't do it.

40
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,730
How'd Kiwi land on an op table?

41
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,850
She was on Tanaka's case, right?

42
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,400
What went wrong?

43
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,150
Ask the gonk next to me.

44
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,150
Fuck off.

45
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,490
Maine punched her out. Lost his cool when
she ran into some ICE that snagged her…

46
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,410
What!?

47
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,530
Maine. How about you
get your head checked?

48
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,040
Maine, next time you start losing it--

49
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,040
Hey…

50
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,040
"Losing it"…?

51
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,050
Cyberpsychosis.

52
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,680
Maine!

53
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,310
Uh… Hey.

54
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,440
Dorio just told me. You…

55
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,520
You'll be fine, right?
You won't end up like…

56
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,650
Fine?

57
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,240
What you mean by "fine"? Kid.

58
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,570
You asking if I'm going psycho?

59
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,200
You think I'm losing it?

60
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,580
Maine, I didn't say…

61
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,750
Lay off, kid.

62
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,290
Your snooping around's
getting on my nerves.

63
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,970
You think you're hot shit
'cause you're faster than me?

64
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,720
That Sandy was supposed to be mine.

65
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,480
I made it this far.

66
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,980
Ain't no way I'm gonna downgrade now…

67
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,610
Can't stop running now…

68
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,360
The pigs probably have our trail already.

69
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,870
We only got 'til morning, if that.

70
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:11,990
Are you hearing me?

71
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,240
I said no!

72
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,750
You're the one that's not listening!

73
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,790
He's Arasaka…

74
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,250
Let's call it off.

75
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,460
C'mon, Lucy.

76
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,130
You don't gotta do it.

77
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,550
Shut it, David!

78
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,300
We can drop Tanaka where we took him.
Pretend none of this happened.

79
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,260
You've got a lot of nerve!

80
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,180
I'm not done with you!

81
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,060
David… Tell me I can do it.

82
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,770
Wha… I thought…

83
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,980
Tell me!

84
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,480
You don't understand
what Arasaka's like at all.

85
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,950
They're always watching us. You… me…

86
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,820
We can't just call it off.

87
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,910
We don't have a choice.

88
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,990
I know that.

89
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,790
But… I need you to tell me that I can.

90
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,790
Please…

91
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,510
I'm sorry, Lucy. I…

92
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,220
I know you can do this.

93
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,300
I believe in you, Lucy.

94
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,430
I'll do it.

95
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,560
What?

96
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,690
But David's coming, too.
And kick Maine out.

97
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,400
Those are my conditions.

98
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,240
Fine.

99
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,070
But you'll keep us in the loop.
Pings every quarter hour.

100
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,780
You've got until daybreak.
Don't screw this up!

101
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,620
David! Where's Maine?

102
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,380
Hell if I know!

103
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,470
Maine!

104
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,350
Dorio…

105
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Hey, you sure we don't need
Dorio for backup?

106
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,190
Grow a spine.

107
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,310
Why didn't you…

108
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,780
You should've told me.

109
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,150
Why's it gotta be just the two of us?

110
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,280
David.

111
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,960
H-Hey…

112
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,210
Why were you hiding your deep-dive port?

113
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,390
Jacking in now…

114
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,470
David…

115
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,640
Yeah?

116
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,230
I'm going in.

117
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,610
Where there's a trap,
there has to be an entryway.

118
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,220
We gonna kill him?

119
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,060
We need a plan
in case she doesn't make it.

120
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,060
Wouldn't have needed one
if you weren't feeling like shit.

121
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,420
You're willing to bet everything
on a backup runner?

122
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,840
Absolutely.

123
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,260
Tick tock, Maine.

124
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,470
Arasaka is still short one executive.

125
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,770
I trust you understand
there's no room for error.

126
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,930
Made that clear.

127
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,980
What?!

128
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,650
The fuck you staring at, Faraday?

129
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,160
A glitch…?

130
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,160
Damn it… Now of all times!

131
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,460
W-Wait…

132
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,540
Wait, please!

133
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,880
David!

134
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,800
Maine! Snap out of it!

135
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,050
Hey!

136
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,350
Damn it! Why is he waking up?!

137
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,770
What are you doing, David?!

138
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,520
I knew it… You're David…

139
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,650
How do you…

140
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,910
I've heard much about you.

141
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:05,240
Your incident with my son at the Academy…

142
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:11,290
And despite that, I ordered
your readmittance to the Academy.

143
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,580
You?

144
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,000
Please, David. You can stop this.

145
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,590
I don't want to die.

146
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,840
We just need the data. You won't…

147
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,720
Don't be so naive!

148
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,850
I've seen their faces!

149
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,600
Do you believe Arasaka
won't hunt them down?

150
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,980
Listen to me.
Why do you think I lifted your expulsion?

151
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,400
You have exceptional abilities.

152
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,610
I believe you could become
a valuable asset to Arasaka!

153
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,870
We could give you a great future, David!

154
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,990
Do not throw your life to waste!

155
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,760
This is it.

156
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,390
I can't let you go.

157
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,560
Then get in contact with Arasaka.

158
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,190
It will all be over
in less than five minutes.

159
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,900
That ain't what I mean!

160
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,280
I can't betray my crew.

161
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,280
Stupid boy.
Don't you see you're being used?

162
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,780
And Arasaka won't?

163
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,080
No. You are blind.

164
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,670
Who do you think is paying for this stunt?

165
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,540
It has Militech written all over it.
All roads lead back to the corporations.

166
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,380
Regardless of
how high you climb in this world,

167
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,590
you will never amount to the lowest corpo.

168
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,050
That's not…

169
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,450
David?

170
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,740
David… What…

171
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,790
What is it that you want?

172
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,330
What do I want…?

173
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,170
David! What the fuck?!

174
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,090
He's awake!

175
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,970
Where's his tranq… Hand it over!

176
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,720
Fuck! What just happened?!

177
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,100
Shit! It's all over if he flatlines!

178
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,020
David!

179
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,140
Snap out of it, David!
You got her in, right?!

180
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,350
Now get her out!

181
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,230
Dorio! Lucy's still stuck in deep-dive!

182
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,980
-What?!
-Hurry! Disconnect her!

183
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,740
Alright! Pull her out!

184
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,590
The data?

185
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,760
Jabbed him right after
his heart stopped… so probably good.

186
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,970
David!

187
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,090
Yeah, Lucy's--

188
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,350
David! What the fuck were you doing?

189
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,850
What about you?

190
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,350
What the fuck were you doing?

191
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,860
What did you say?

192
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,730
Knocking Kiwi out…
Dropping all this on Lucy's lap.

193
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,070
What the fuck's been up with you?!

194
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,860
Kid, don't start…

195
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,370
Maine! David!

196
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:36,580
Jammer got fried when Tanaka flatlined!
Trauma Team caught the signal!

197
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,870
Motherfuck!

198
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,460
David, we ain't done yet!

199
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,500
But prep our wheels, quick!

200
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,720
Get it together, David!

201
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,340
You volunteered for this, so do it!

202
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,720
Wait in the ride. We'll catch up.

203
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,970
I know!

204
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,560
Fucking Platinum premium plan service…

205
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,600
Dorio!

206
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,400
Registering gunfire in the service area.

207
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:13,570
Possible hostiles present.
Requesting NCPD backup in force.

208
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,920
David?

209
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,670
Lucy! You alright?

210
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,420
What's going on?

211
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,390
Tanaka woke up, but his brain
suddenly fried for some reason.

212
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,770
Did something happen in there?

213
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,600
Where's Maine and Dorio?

214
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,810
They're bringing Tanaka's body…

215
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,310
But he's dead.

216
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,980
We saved him.

217
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,650
Why?!

218
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,110
What do you mean? We still need the data.

219
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,200
There's no point bringing him.

220
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,860
There was no data.

221
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,200
No way…

222
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,790
Fuck. We're definitely on
'Saka's radar now.

223
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,830
Maine! Don't forget to take your meds!

224
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,630
Just took a shot!

225
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,540
Don't move!

226
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,600
Fuck! Why's NCPD always fast
when it comes to us?

227
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,600
Back up! Go to the back!

228
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,350
Fuck! They won't pick up!

229
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,110
David!

230
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,400
Where are you going?

231
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,320
Gonna go help.

232
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,990
No! What if they slip out another way?

233
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,240
We're waiting!

234
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,620
I'm going.

235
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,620
David!

236
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:47,080
What are you so afraid of?!
It shouldn't be taking 'em this long!

237
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,000
Wait!

238
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:53,010
I got a signal. Trauma is here…
alongside the NCPD.

239
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,010
They're surrounded.

240
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,090
Then we gotta help.

241
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,260
No! Do you want to die?!

242
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,230
I won't die. I'll come back to you.

243
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,610
David…

244
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:15,070
They might not make it.
We should cut our losses and run.

245
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,280
We can still hear them fighting!
They're still alive!

246
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,700
You're acting weird today, Lucy.

247
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,540
You saw something, didn't you?
In Tanaka's neural net…

248
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,420
I… only wanted to…

249
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,500
Lucy?

250
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,590
Aren't you gonna tell me

251
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,220
that you believe in me, too?

252
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,200
The fuck, Maine?!

253
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,860
Get it together…

254
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,710
Shit! Fucking gonk…

255
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,340
Don't shoot!

256
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,340
Why not?!

257
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,300
He's holding a platinum client hostage!

258
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,220
Not our problem!

259
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,830
Dorio…

260
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:50,080
Maine… Hold on, I'm on my way.

261
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,500
I need…

262
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,590
I need you to tell me I can do this.

263
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,600
Was this…

264
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,810
Was this my fault?

265
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,610
Freeze! Weapons down,
hands behind your head!

266
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,620
Last warning!

267
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,000
Platinum client confirmed dead.

268
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:36,960
Hey.

269
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,380
Is this my fault?

270
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,140
It's cyberpsychosis!

271
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,890
Flag MaxTac now…

272
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,140
Got a cyberpsy--

273
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,440
Client has flatlined. Evacuate!

274
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,020
Hey, where are you going?!

275
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,560
Client policy's void!
This's your problem now!

276
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,520
Fuck that!

277
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,320
He's here! Get us out!

278
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,050
Shit!

279
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,100
David… Can you hear me?

280
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,100
Maine's gone psycho.

281
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,480
They've called in MaxTac.
Turn around, come back…

282
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,980
Maine…

283
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,240
Oh. Hey, kid.

284
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,110
You alright?

285
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,620
Maine, I came to back you up…

286
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,030
Uh…

287
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,830
Dorio's dead.

288
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,250
What?

289
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,500
What are you doing…?

290
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,000
Last thing I can do for her.

291
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,590
Let's run, Maine.

292
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,130
You're gonna die.

293
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:10,140
No more running. Reaper's calling my name.

294
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,640
What are you saying?

295
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,860
Fine. I'll fight too.

296
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,360
Kid…

297
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,530
I've already made up my mind.
I'll do it! I'll save you.

298
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,780
Damn it! Stop shaking!

299
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:33,750
Fuck you, MaxTac! Come and get us!

300
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,500
Maine, we can get through this together.

301
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:40,540
We'll get through this. And then… then…

302
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,820
David.

303
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,820
You can't do it.

304
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,080
Why… Maine…

305
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,160
Why…

306
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,630
David.

307
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,760
This is the end of the line for me.

308
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:37,600
But not for you.
Fast is what you do, remember?

309
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,100
Keep running.
