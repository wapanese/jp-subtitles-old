1
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,710
Man, I thought you're off-duty in five?
They still called you in? Tough luck.

2
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,250
Cap said I could leave my gun and badge
if I'd rather go home

3
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,090
and listen to mama go on and on
about online shopping or whatever.

4
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,010
That's what you get
for choosing the life of a cop.

5
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,930
It just had to fucking rain…

6
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,100
What's your problem? Back it up.

7
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,480
Wanna get shot…

8
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,170
Got a cyberpsycho!

9
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,920
Raise MaxTac now!

10
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,980
Fry his system.

11
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,940
Freak's got military-grade ICE!

12
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,860
So is ours.

13
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,820
Go!

14
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,750
So wacked!

15
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,780
What?! Cut it out, man!

16
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,380
Cycle suspended due to insufficient funds…

17
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,010
Not again…

18
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:25,550
Tragedy in Westbrook. A corporate convoy
was ambushed by 6th Street…

19
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,850
Jeez, mom…

20
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,220
Morning.

21
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,980
Sleeping on the couch again?
You know you've got a bed.

22
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,860
Just dead after my night shift is all.

23
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,320
You and the washing machine both.

24
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,610
Forget to re-up it?

25
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,860
Yeah…

26
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,610
I'll do it later, 'kay?

27
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,290
Speaking of money, when did you say
you needed that update for class?

28
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,540
It's fine. Got Doc to handle it.

29
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,710
"Handle it"?

30
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,130
Yep, all set.

31
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,550
Don't go cutting corners, Dee.

32
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,380
I'm getting paid tonight,
so you get it properly updated, okay?

33
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,720
It's fine. We don't even have enough
to re-up the washing machine.

34
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,760
I told you I just forgot.

35
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,600
Promise me you'll buy the update.

36
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,390
Okay, okay.

37
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,060
Are you going to school dressed like that?

38
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,860
My uniform's soaked.

39
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,400
A military-grade implant
was found missing from

40
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,360
the body of Lt. Col. James Norris
who was shot dead by MaxTac…

41
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,700
Mom, you're on TV!

42
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,780
Nova!

43
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,160
Not nova, David. A bloodbath.

44
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,330
Go on, off to school.

45
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,660
Fine.

46
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,040
Love you.

47
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,670
Maine?

48
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,960
It's Gloria.

49
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:35,310
Trauma Team. Clear the way immediately.

50
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,980
Emergency evac underway.

51
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,560
All AVs immediately vacate the airway.

52
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,270
I repeat. Trauma Team…

53
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,730
Good morning, class.

54
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,770
Today's attendance, zero absences.

55
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,770
Martinez, David.

56
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,280
You are not wearing the Academy uniform.

57
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,280
Sorry. It's still at the cleaner's.

58
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,120
Where is your spare?

59
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,080
The spare's there too.

60
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,080
Understood. Please submit
a Uniform Exception form after class.

61
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,290
Now let us begin today's lesson.

62
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,650
I would like to ask all students
to log into the Green Room for meditation.

63
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,320
Counting on ya, Doc…

64
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,450
What's going on?

65
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,490
It's Martinez.

66
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,080
It's a virus!

67
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,260
I'm so sorry
for the inconvenience he's caused.

68
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,380
I wouldn't say this is just
a matter of money, Mrs. Martinez.

69
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,350
Although it was
quite an expense to restore the system.

70
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,180
Of course, and I will pay for the repairs.

71
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,100
What?

72
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,940
As I understand it,
David modified his headset

73
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,610
with back-alley software
to avoid paying for the licensed update.

74
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,570
With all due respect, could this be
related to some financial difficulties?

75
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,860
It's no problem, really. We can afford it.

76
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,830
I believe this is a good opportunity
to reconsider David's situation.

77
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,120
What situation?

78
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,500
Well, David doesn't fit in
with his classmates.

79
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,540
A change in environment could benefit--

80
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,550
No! He has to stay here.

81
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,720
He deserves this education
as much as every other kid here…

82
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,720
Didn't I tell you to get the upgrade?

83
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,310
Doc's fault, he gave me a busted drive…

84
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:07,390
You tried to outsmart the system and now
we owe ten times the original cost.

85
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,980
Sorry…

86
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,570
If you're gonna apologize anyway,
don't do it in the first place.

87
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,440
You said you didn't have the eddies
first time I asked…

88
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,990
Because it wasn't payday yet!

89
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,450
Of course we don't got cash
just lying around!

90
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,700
And can't you sit still?

91
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,000
Y'know, I've been thinking lately…

92
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,580
About?

93
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,090
Maybe I drop out…
Find work now or whatever.

94
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,710
Do you hear yourself?!

95
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,880
C'mon, seriously.
You know we can't afford those repairs.

96
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,470
Plus, you got no clue
how much I stick out.

97
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,890
Anyone who's not a true-blue corpo
gets shit on constantly.

98
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,650
They'll never accept me,
even if I do graduate.

99
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,320
Don't wanna be a corpo anyway.

100
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,700
Then what've I been busting my ass for?

101
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,660
Everything I do is for you, Dee…
Don't you see that?

102
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,000
You're breaking my heart.

103
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,120
Mom…?

104
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,750
My baby boy… So smart and so talented.

105
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,590
I just wanna give you a fighting chance
in this city, a good education…

106
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:27,100
That's why I put in the hours,
why I'm never home!

107
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,060
I'm sorry.

108
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,020
Shouldn't have brought it up.
Don't cry, mom…

109
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,320
You think I don't know how they treat you?

110
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,860
You think I don't get treated
the same way?

111
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,570
But that's why you gotta prove 'em wrong.

112
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,490
I want you to work hard, rise up,

113
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,870
and get to the top floor of Arasaka Tower!

114
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,580
I know you got it in you, Dee.

115
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,460
Easier said than… done…

116
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,090
Fuck 'em up!

117
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,470
Don't let 'em get away!

118
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,640
Fuck! Suit's limo's plated!

119
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,600
The hunt's on, beastbros!

120
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,820
No one fucks with the Animals!

121
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,660
Mom! Brake hard!

122
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,780
Mom!

123
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,300
Mom?

124
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,090
Mom!

125
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,390
Trauma Team? Thank God…

126
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,190
Not a client.

127
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,190
Neither is she.

128
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,110
Wait!

129
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,940
Secure the policy holder.
Leave these guys to the city meat wagons.

130
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,700
-Copy that.
-What?!

131
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,450
What the hell? Hey! Wait!

132
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,700
Shit!

133
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,700
You're just gonna leave us here?!

134
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,710
Mom!

135
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,710
Wake up!

136
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,710
Fucking piece of…

137
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:24,010
Mom! Damn it, get off me!

138
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:27,970
Get the fuck off! Damn it!

139
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,930
Shit, shit, shit!

140
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,720
Shit!

141
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:41,190
Surgery was a success. She hasn't come to
just yet, but she's stable.

142
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,400
We'll keep her
a few more nights to observe.

143
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,610
Oh… Can't I see her?

144
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,490
No can do, kid.
Visitation's not part of your package.

145
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,160
R-Right…

146
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,120
Anyway, here's some paperwork and
your bill. Brought your mom's things, too.

147
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,290
Zip us those eddies within three days.

148
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,210
Uh…

149
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,090
There's a reason everyone
in Night City wants insurance, kid.

150
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,210
Have a good one.

151
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,470
Yeah, yeah, looking for
a buyer for a hoops chip…

152
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,470
You gotta be low-balling me,
That's all? What?

153
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,390
Nah, forget it, choom.

154
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,770
Damn it!

155
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,600
What the fuck?!

156
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,530
There's another account…

157
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,080
Never knew she saved so much…

158
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,540
So, this settles the medical…

159
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,880
Gotta cover the rent.

160
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:45,340
Doc? Hey, you get the still I sent?

161
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:50,680
Listen, don't think I've forgotten about
that shoddy bootleg you gave me…

162
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,970
Ugh. Whatever, man.

163
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,810
This cyberware…
Yeah, looks military-grade, right?

164
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:02,400
What do you think it could fetch?

165
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,230
Not selling. Just want an estimate.

166
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,070
Nah, fuck that noise,
no way it's that cheap.

167
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,950
C'mon, choom.

168
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,000
Whatever, wasn't selling anyway.

169
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,920
And don't expect me to push
your XBDs at school anymore!

170
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,920
Taking me for a gonk…

171
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,590
A Sandevistan…

172
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,100
No serial.
Military-grade, this thing, really?

173
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,060
Definitely ain't legal, but…

174
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,230
Whoa! The hell are these specs?!

175
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:06,340
Drop out of the Academy.
Learn to take a hint, David Martinez.

176
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,380
About what?

177
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,260
Our class. You're not welcome.

178
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,800
If this is about yesterday--

179
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,220
Who said anything about yesterday?

180
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,760
You think I give you a hard time
'cause you're poor? No.

181
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,890
In fact, I consider myself charitable.

182
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,480
And it's not your fault
that you were born poor.

183
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,190
There's no rule that says
a street kid can't attend the Academy,

184
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,610
provided they pay tuition, of course.

185
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,440
What cracks my chrome is
something else entirely.

186
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,740
-Know what it is?
-Choom…

187
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,160
I haven't understood
a thing outta your mouth.

188
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,700
That right there!

189
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,450
Drop out. Get gone.

190
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,370
What?

191
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,200
You're a misfit, an anomaly.

192
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:48,340
Human trash. And nothing can change that.
Rot goes as deep as your bones.

193
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,840
Best you can do
is not spread it to the rest of us.

194
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,470
Did I short-circ?

195
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,180
Thought you didn't care
so long as I paid tuition.

196
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:01,220
I heard mommy came to see the principal
to beg for forgiveness yesterday.

197
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:05,480
Caused quite a scene, crying for
her baby boy not to get expelled, right?

198
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,850
Shameless.

199
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,570
Y'know, it's always been a mystery to me…

200
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:13,110
How could she afford to send you
to Arasaka Academy in the first place?

201
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,110
Care to explain, David Martinez?

202
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,620
What does mommy do
to pay your way through school?

203
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:26,290
What does any Night City bottom-feeder do
to make a quick eurobuck, huh?

204
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,420
A couple of things come to mind…

205
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,630
Enough of this shit.

206
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,880
Whoa, who said we were done?

207
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,210
Fuck off!

208
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,380
The hell?

209
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,100
Huh? What?

210
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,600
Oh?

211
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,600
Huuuh?

212
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,490
What's that you've got slotted?
Some kind of freeware?

213
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:28,020
The Strongarms 400 really does
bring out the best in kung-fu chipware.

214
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,060
Seriously? Organic knuckles?

215
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,110
If you wanna try me again,
better pack some chrome.

216
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,990
Or just drop out of school already.

217
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:51,170
Mr. Martinez? I'm calling in regard to
Gloria Martinez's condition…

218
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:57,670
She was stable this morning,
but her vitals nosedived out of nowhere.

219
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,640
But you said…
You said the surgery went fine.

220
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,890
Her body was already weak.

221
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,560
She wouldn't have lasted long even if
she wasn't on the discount package.

222
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,640
Looked like she was overworked.

223
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,440
Here are some burial options we offer.

224
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,360
There's a reason everyone wants
a corporate gig in Night City, kid.

225
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,320
Valued customer,
we are sorry for your loss.

226
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,830
We can deliver the body of the deceased
to your home or funeral center.

227
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,450
Would you like to hear
about our payment plans?

228
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,790
Do I have a choice?

229
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,710
Is our budget-friendly
cremation service right for you?

230
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,920
Waive those pesky delivery fees and…

231
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,220
Good day, Mrs. Martinez.

232
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,440
We've received a quote for the repairs
to our damaged system infrastructure.

233
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,940
I've sent you the details as agreed.
Or perhaps you've had time to reflect?

234
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:02,200
If you can't make the payment on time,
we'll have no choice but to expel David…

235
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,700
If you wish to continue
your utilities contract,

236
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,040
you will need to pay
a penalty of 500 eurodollars

237
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,500
in addition to any past due
amounts and late fees.

238
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,920
If you are unable to make the payment,
your utilities will be shut down…

239
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,670
Trauma Team. Clear the way immediately.

240
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:26,470
Ding ding, Martinez! Time's up!
Rent's long overdue!

241
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,390
Keep this shit up
and I won't just be changing your lock.

242
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:34,350
I'll throw your ass out
on the street, hear me?!

243
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,580
The implant I showed you…
You said you'd take it for 10K?

244
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:58,250
Six now? Choom, no.
Just yesterday you said 10!

245
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,630
You and I both know it's worth way more!

246
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,800
Yeah, I looked into it, and…

247
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,180
Oh yeah? Fine! Fuck you too!

248
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,300
Fuck!

249
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,610
The hell… Who is it?

250
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,440
Oh. David, hey.

251
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,650
That the big, bad Sandy?

252
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:14,120
There's not a badge or fixer in town
who's not looking for that beauty.

253
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,170
I told ya, you ain't gonna find anyone
sane enough to take it off your hands.

254
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,790
I'm not here to sell.

255
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,880
I want this… fused right here.

256
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,130
It's high time I chromed up.
