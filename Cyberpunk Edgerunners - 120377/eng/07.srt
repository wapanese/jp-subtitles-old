1
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,640
Feeling a lil' antsy there, Julio?

2
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,850
No way!

3
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,150
You're the one Wakako sicced on us, right?

4
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,770
Heard you're David's fan.

5
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,530
Yeah! But what do you mean
she sicced me on you?

6
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,860
Hear that, David?

7
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,030
You have fans now.
Probably 'cause you got all swole.

8
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:40,870
Where's your gun?

9
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,910
What do you use?

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,710
Uh, I've got a Lexington.

11
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,500
That won't cut it.

12
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,500
You gonna go up
against Maelstrom with that?

13
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,000
Use this.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,420
Seriously, dude?! A fucking Satara!

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,130
Nova! Thanks, man!

16
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,550
Tech shotguns are so cool.

17
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,100
Charge-up shots, oh yeah…

18
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,060
Boom!

19
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,270
Boom!

20
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,150
Boom!

21
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,480
Knock it off!

22
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,320
Ow! Stop! Watch the knees!

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,780
What are you, five?!

24
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,910
Just stick behind me. Don't rush ahead.

25
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:22,040
You want me to take rear?
I ain't no rookie, man.

26
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,660
Attention, ladies.

27
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,910
One minute from the destination.

28
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,990
Looks like they're heading in the front.

29
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,990
Clearly. Meatbrain move!

30
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,540
The fuck?

31
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,000
Who ordered lunch meat?

32
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,250
Ya little babies lost?

33
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,750
Looks like they wanna start something.

34
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,250
You got shit in your ears?!

35
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,840
Better start talking before
I drill you a fresh earhole--

36
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,760
Better stop talking before you die.

37
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,520
Tagging complete. Short circ incoming…

38
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,770
Done! Close-call but made it, asshole!

39
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,770
Fuck! They've got a netrunner!

40
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,160
Ahh! We're all gonna die!

41
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,040
Come on!

42
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,080
Out of ammo!

43
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,960
Bitch got no juice!

44
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,090
Fuck her up!

45
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,010
Time for… the big guns!

46
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,090
There's a turret!

47
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,350
Watch out! The runner's got control of--

48
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,350
Damn brat, ordering me around…

49
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,610
Ready to play with a real Maelstrom?

50
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,740
Oh, damn…

51
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,620
That shit even human?!

52
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,880
Gimme that organic ass…

53
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,980
And I'll tear you a new hole!

54
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,950
You're the one getting a new hole.

55
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,960
That was insane! …Zoot-zoot-zoot, bang!

56
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,210
Those your new leg implants? Looking good.

57
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,640
Got it! Room in the back, right?

58
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Wait! Julio!

59
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,980
If there are traps…

60
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,870
Isabella Morgan, where you at?

61
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,120
Your dad put out an SOS for you.

62
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,040
You're safe now.

63
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,420
Thank ya kindly.

64
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,420
Thanks for taking the wheel, Falco.

65
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,880
No sweat off my back.

66
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,510
Nah, good drivers are hard to come by.

67
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,220
Dunno about that.
Seems you got a fan club now.

68
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,930
You mean like Julio?

69
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,560
I knew that gonk was bluffing
the moment I saw him.

70
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:30,240
Aren't many veterans who'd work with
a kid like me unless they knew Maine.

71
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,410
Gotta admit, first time you called,

72
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,240
I thought you were a pushy pipsqueak.

73
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,710
But now? Well…

74
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,960
You're gonna go further
than Maine ever could.

75
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,260
Gonna roll out before this gets all sappy.

76
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,470
Buzz me for your next big gig, huh?

77
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,300
Catch you later, David. Kiwi.

78
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,220
See ya.

79
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,970
Bye.

80
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,230
Honestly? I doubted you had it
in you to take the reins.

81
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,020
All thanks to our preem runner.

82
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,070
We both know you don't mean me.

83
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,320
You've asked her, right?

84
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,530
Used to. I kinda gave up trying.

85
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,540
Didn't peg her as the type
to get cold feet.

86
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,750
I bet it's more than
what happened to Maine and Dorio.

87
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,840
Back at the warehouse,
Lucy was acting weird.

88
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,130
Meaning what?

89
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,840
Whole thing's kind of a blur.
Might've been nothing.

90
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:45,600
Speaking of, you're the one
that brought Lucy into the crew, right?

91
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,770
Yeah.

92
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,110
She talk to you about her past?

93
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,650
Nope.

94
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,610
Most of the saps in our league
don't bring up the old days.

95
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,240
Shame, greed,
something to prove… whatever.

96
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,500
Whether you're looking for a way out
or a way up, does it matter?

97
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,790
Why the long face, David?!

98
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,380
Stop flirting with the nagging hag
and dance with me!

99
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:17,010
Although some edgerunners die
in more shame than they started with…

100
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:23,140
At least I didn't get flatlined
by a psycho with his dick out in the wind.

101
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,520
Anyway, have you ever seen
David dance? It's a riot…

102
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,150
Sorry, I'm heading out.
Gonna stop by Doc's.

103
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,030
Wha? Again?

104
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,030
Tell him to sell you
a dance chip or something!

105
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,530
-A real good one!
-Shut up.

106
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,820
Catch ya later.

107
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,700
Why you gotta play
hard-to-get all the time?!

108
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,120
Why don't you shake up your approach?

109
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,540
Yeah?

110
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,130
Think I should play shy and nerdy…
at the shy and nerdy?

111
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,220
This warped piece of metal's just
shoved up your arm socket.

112
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,560
It doesn't fit you in the first place.

113
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,480
On top of that, it's an old model.

114
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,310
Got all kinds of next-gen chrome out back…

115
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,310
I'm fine with this one.

116
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,820
Tsk. Fine. It's your funeral.

117
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,110
Got muscle reinforcers?
Kiroshi's new model?

118
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,370
Didn't know I was talking to
a tweaked out chromehead.

119
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,580
I'm not.

120
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,660
You need to take it easy.

121
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,620
At this rate, ain't no way
your mind can keep up.

122
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,040
I'm fine.

123
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,670
No matter how much chrome I get,
I don't feel a damn thing.

124
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,420
Metal feels better
than being in my own skin.

125
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,590
Gotta admit, your adaptability to
cyberware is fucking nuts.

126
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,100
Ain't never seen a kid
cyborg out quite like this.

127
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,810
Your cyberware capacity's already--

128
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,980
You think you're special?

129
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,400
Just must be special, I guess.

130
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,770
You aiming to be like
Adam Smasher or what?

131
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,030
Adam what?

132
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,900
Damn. All this time and
you're still a fucking newb.

133
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,660
Don't even know Adam Smasher.

134
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,830
Some know him as a war hero
from the 4th Corporate War.

135
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:09,160
To others, a fully cyborged
boogeyman, walking nightmare.

136
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,290
But to all, a living legend, ask anyone.

137
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,630
What kinda legend?

138
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,800
There's probably a graveyard out there

139
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,470
full of big shots he flatlined
on Arasaka's orders.

140
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,260
Sounds like a hoax.

141
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,800
Kiwi?

142
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,100
What's up?

143
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,060
Can you drop by the Afterlife?

144
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,560
You guys still out bar hopping?

145
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,060
Got someone here who wants to see you.

146
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,730
David.

147
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,940
Hey, Kiwi.

148
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,070
Wish you luck.

149
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,080
I believe this is the first time
we meet, Mister Martinez.

150
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,580
We've crossed paths…
You came to a party once to talk to Maine.

151
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,080
Is that so?
I believe introductions are in order.

152
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,460
I am Faraday.

153
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,130
You have a job for me?

154
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,970
No need to rush. Let me buy you a drink.

155
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,850
I've heard a great deal about you.

156
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,390
You are making quite a name for yourself.

157
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,850
The rookie with the Sandevistan.

158
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,070
I've got more than the Sandy now.

159
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:22,110
This is true. It seems now
you are more steel than bone.

160
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,160
Maine and I had
a mutually beneficial work relationship.

161
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,580
I know.

162
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,290
He understood crew chemistry.

163
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,200
He did.

164
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:35,120
But his flaw was personal attachment.

165
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,630
Familiarity muddies the mind,
leads to ruin.

166
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,960
I hear that you're also good
with teamwork.

167
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,800
But I keep my private
and professional life separate.

168
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,850
I would like for you to convince me that
you can work at the same level as Maine.

169
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:50,970
You're testing me?

170
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,310
You can think of it that way.

171
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:56,650
You can test me all you want,
but I ain't running jobs for cheap.

172
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,150
Nothing I do is cheap.

173
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,780
This a Militech job?

174
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,040
They're at odds with Arasaka.

175
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,290
As you might expect,
corporate jobs pay out the most.

176
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,500
Do you oppose?

177
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,630
Consider it done.

178
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,050
Good to hear.

179
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,880
There is an assignment
I'd like you to take over after this job.

180
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,510
It's a matter familiar to you.

181
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,010
You mean the data you wanted from Tanaka?

182
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:33,220
Unfortunately, I received a report
that Tanaka had no data.

183
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,140
Yup.

184
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:38,100
But I also received a report that
you successfully bypassed Arasaka's ICE.

185
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,020
And that this wasn't done by Kiwi,
but by a back-up runner.

186
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,440
Yeah. Our team's got
lucky with good runners.

187
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,530
Excellent. However, I hear
this runner is not present.

188
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,030
Yeah. They left the team after that case.

189
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,540
Why is that? Such a waste of good talent.

190
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,790
Their heart's just not in it.

191
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,040
It wouldn't hurt to try
to convince her again.

192
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,000
Easier said than done…

193
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,430
Arasaka knows that
Militech's after them, right?

194
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,010
Of course.

195
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,810
What's Militech after
that they'd want this bad?

196
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:18,190
That is my concern and none of yours.

197
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,940
Needless details
would only get in your way.

198
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,690
Learn anything new that might help?

199
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:27,700
Not yet. But as they say,
"Good things come to those who wait."

200
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,320
But you've yet to prove
that you're worth my time.

201
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,590
You're home.

202
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,760
It's pretty late.

203
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,510
Got caught up.

204
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,430
Made a victory lap at Minjung's?

205
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,430
Yeah.

206
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,060
Any problems on the job?

207
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,140
We lost someone tonight.

208
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,980
Who?

209
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,350
Greenhorn solo Wakako sent us.

210
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,400
Oh. But everything went fine otherwise?

211
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,400
Easy. The newb just jumped the gun.

212
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,200
Sounds like some other newb I once knew.

213
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,360
Hey.

214
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,830
So…

215
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,000
We got something big coming up.

216
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,620
How fun.

217
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:24,170
And it'd really help
if you'd get on board…

218
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,380
Two runners makes for a crowd, doesn't it?

219
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,470
You know that I'd rather have--

220
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,800
David, please.

221
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,890
I need more time.

222
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,890
Fine. Okay.

223
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,850
You were diving again?

224
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,440
Why don't you buy a runnersuit?

225
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,860
Don't need one.

226
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,360
We can get you a new chair.
The ice-bath can't be comfortable.

227
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:55,070
Thank you.
But I don't like wearing a suit.

228
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,660
Oh.

229
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,700
Sorry, I didn't know.

230
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,830
Hey, David?

231
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,130
Come with me.

232
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,260
Whoa! Look at the stars!

233
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,720
Can't get a view like this in the city.

234
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,810
-Think I can catch one?
-As if.

235
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,350
Wish we could've seen the moon.

236
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,360
The stars shine brighter
because the moon's not out.

237
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,530
Really?

238
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,490
The moon outshines the stars.

239
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,740
What were they teaching you
at the Academy?

240
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,450
I'm a drop-out, remember?

241
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,080
Right, right.

242
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,660
Never been outside of the city.

243
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,080
Huh.

244
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,330
You had a life outside the city once, huh?

245
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,720
The city looks like a cage
made of lights from here.

246
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,100
You may not remember…

247
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,980
You said you and I are different.

248
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,600
Yes.

249
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,270
What did you mean by that?

250
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,280
Don't wanna talk about it?

251
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,410
You'd rather not hear.

252
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,740
I just… wanna know more about you.

253
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,500
Arasaka.

254
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,620
Arasaka?

255
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,880
Yes.

256
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,000
I was born in a different country
and raised in an Arasaka facility.

257
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:38,510
Including me, 13 children passed
proficiency tests to become netrunners.

258
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,260
Kids who wouldn't be missed
if they disappeared.

259
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,930
"We'll serve the world's most
powerful megacorp one day…"

260
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,730
That dream is what got us through
the hard days of training.

261
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,860
It's the dream we were given,
the dream we never questioned.

262
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,870
But when training ended,
we weren't assigned to a corpo office.

263
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:08,000
We were taken to an underground facility
where we were constantly forced to dive…

264
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,210
They sent us into the Old Net.

265
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,250
Old Net?

266
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,680
That's the old internet domain that
collapsed around 50 years ago, right?

267
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,590
Yes.

268
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,720
Brought down by history's greatest
netrunner, creator of daemons…

269
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:27,020
Hacker savant, legend, Rache Bartmoss.

270
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,730
The guy that brought down
78 percent of the world wide web.

271
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,360
His DataKrash virus shattered cyberspace…

272
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,580
…Broke the Net into a scattered
mosaic of isolated localnets.

273
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:49,210
Arasaka's purpose was in the Old Net.
The legacies of the past.

274
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,540
Vast amounts of lost knowledge.

275
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:57,170
And we were soldiers being sent to a nest
of illegal malware and aggressive AI.

276
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:02,180
Advanced netrunners can dive
into it with their whole mind.

277
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,680
You mean deep-diving.

278
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,770
And diving materializes cyberspace
into a traversable world.

279
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:11,310
But whenever we uncovered
any rare data cache…

280
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:19,150
Rogue AIs would find and attack us.

281
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,660
We were picked off one by one.

282
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,910
I continued to dive,
thinking that each time would be my last.

283
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,960
Soon, there were only
a handful of us left.

284
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:37,090
We were being killed
to live someone else's dream.

285
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:41,680
So we thought, "If we're going to die,
why not die trying to escape?"

286
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,430
The tech staff didn't stand a chance.
Not against the skills they'd taught us.

287
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,470
And we escaped.

288
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,440
I kept running.

289
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,110
I could hear my friends crying out,

290
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,070
but I didn't look back.

291
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,000
When I came to,
I was living out in a junkyard.

292
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:21,340
After that, I was too scared
to stay in one place.

293
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,510
So I traveled to different cities.

294
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:29,470
But there's no place like Night City
if all you wanna do is hide.

295
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,480
You still feel like you're being chased?

296
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:37,230
Not really. Guess I just got
too comfortable here.

297
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,400
Or maybe I've grown used to being scared.

298
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,570
That hand…

299
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,240
It's nothing.
It'll be alright in a second.

300
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:51,120
You haven't changed at all.
Still living for someone else's dream.

301
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,040
It's not like I don't understand.

302
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:05,260
I don't think I'm scared
for myself anymore.

303
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,390
I'm more scared that…

304
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,890
Someday, you'll…

305
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,690
Yes. I was able to recover
most of the data.

306
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,030
The information on
one of the test subjects

307
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:29,160
appears to be completely corrupted.

308
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,740
I would say that it was
intentionally manipulated.

309
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,290
There's no trace on the ICE.

310
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,670
This hacking couldn't have been done
by an average runner.

311
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,170
I don't believe Tanaka
would have erased it.

312
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:46,090
So it must have been manipulated
during his capture.

313
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:51,010
Understood.
I'll see what I can do to restore it.

314
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,220
Goodbye.
