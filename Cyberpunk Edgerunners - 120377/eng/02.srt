1
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,930
It's high time I chromed up.

2
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,970
Get the fuck outta here.

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,390
I already gave you the quote to sell.

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,680
Not here to sell.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,600
I'm here to install.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,310
Listen. That's military grade.

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,810
You either got the build
to handle it or you don't.

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,570
And choom, you don't got it.

9
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,860
Spoken like a ripper
who cares about his clients.

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,490
Hah! Snarky for a kid
who can't even afford me.

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,790
Fuck you.

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,700
Hold on.

13
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,250
Fuck it, man. I'll bite.

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,500
I'll chip you up.

15
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,670
But when you come crying to yank it off…

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,590
'cause it's poaching your brain,
I get the Sandy for free.

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,060
So, ready to rip?

18
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:52,210
At the convention, Lavabre attempted
to persuade Arasaka by using the…

19
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,800
Martinez, David.
Your tardiness has been recorded.

20
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,710
Get a load of this guy…

21
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,720
Is he serio--

22
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,890
We're at school you gonk!

23
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,970
There are cameras. Have you lost your--

24
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,020
Afraid of getting caught?

25
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,100
'Cause I sure ain't.

26
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,020
Come on.

27
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,150
Well?

28
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,300
Ow… That hurt…

29
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,640
Ow… What did you do?!

30
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,150
What kind of implant is that?
You broke my nose!

31
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,400
You're done for!

32
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,400
My father's an Arasaka exec!
On the Academy's board!

33
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,570
Do you know how easy it'd be
to have you expelled?

34
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,820
Like I give a shit.

35
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,180
Is he serio--

36
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,570
My father's an Arasaka exec!
On the Academy's board!

37
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,030
Do you know how easy it'd be
to have you expelled?

38
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:50,540
Marcus, why am I being shown footage
of my own son being assaulted?

39
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,420
This student is David Martinez,
17 years old, from Santo Domingo.

40
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,290
He is a top student at the Academy,

41
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,000
but he was found using a bootleg wreath
that corrupted the Academy's hardware.

42
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,470
He has no father and his mother was
recently killed in a traffic accident.

43
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,470
He owes a considerable amount of debt--

44
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,930
How is this relevant?

45
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,180
Notice his movements…

46
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,930
He has the Sandevistan that James Norris
had at the time of this death.

47
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,230
The case that was filed
as a cyberpsychotic incident.

48
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,150
Yes, sir.

49
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:24,570
Yet, unlike the soldier, this student
displays no side effects from the implant.

50
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:31,030
His tolerance for cybernetics could make
him a prime candidate to test the product.

51
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,370
I see. And where is he now?

52
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,750
He was expelled, sir.

53
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,910
Summon him.

54
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,830
Lure him with the promise of
financial aid if you must.

55
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,960
And what of your son?

56
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,880
As my heir, it's high time he learned…

57
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,970
what it means to serve
the company's best interests.

58
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,360
I'm so fucked.

59
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,870
Wash cycle complete…

60
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,420
Come with me.

61
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,010
The hell is your problem?

62
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,010
What?

63
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,300
You're messing with my work.

64
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,890
Work? Looked more like a picksocket to me.

65
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,020
You some kinda badge?

66
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,640
Can't believe you're a petty thief…

67
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,110
Do I know you?

68
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,940
No… not really. Just--

69
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,530
Ooh, you're in trouble.

70
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,450
Huh?

71
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,830
Really? A Sandevistan?
Not an off-the-rack model, either.

72
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,660
I won't press you.
This is Night City after all…

73
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,580
Crazy idea. How about we work together?

74
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,880
What, stealing?

75
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,840
I only steal from Arasaka suits.

76
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,720
What about me then? I look corpo to you?

77
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,220
My scan picked up an ID
from Arasaka Academy.

78
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,390
But you're right,
you definitely don't look the type.

79
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,940
I dropped out.

80
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,810
Oh? A bad boy.

81
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,690
It's just 'Saka you target?

82
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,190
You in?

83
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,240
Gonna break poor momma's heart, y'know.

84
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,990
Lesson number one.

85
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,330
Less judgment, more awareness.

86
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,500
Yeah, yeah. So, what's my cut?

87
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,330
We'll split the haul 80-20.

88
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,840
Fuck that. Don't you need my Sandevistan?

89
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,340
But I'm the one pushing
the klepped shards.

90
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,880
Plus, now I have a trainee to supervise.

91
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,510
Trainee…?

92
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,390
I'm actually tight on eddies right now.
Can't we do 60-40?

93
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,730
70-30. And I'll pay you
the second the job's done.

94
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,440
Fine.

95
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,650
It's a deal.

96
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,400
Call me Lucy.

97
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,280
David.

98
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,940
So? How did I do?

99
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,810
I'd say you're well worth the 20%.

100
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,320
It's 30!

101
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,820
Kidding.

102
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,320
Keep it rolling on another car?

103
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,620
Maybe a different line.
By now, someone's probably noticed.

104
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,580
We should keep the risk to a minimum…

105
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,830
How bad?

106
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,500
Rookie mistake.

107
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,090
Hasn't taken any precautions
since installing that implant.

108
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,050
Which immunosuppressant is he on?

109
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,460
He insured?

110
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,840
No clue. Doesn't look like he would be.

111
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,640
Any family or guardian? Anyone I can call?

112
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,850
Dunno. Parents, I guess.

113
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,730
He used to go to the Academy.

114
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,060
Arasaka? No wonder he could afford this.

115
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,110
Hold on…

116
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,990
Hey. How ya feeling?

117
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,320
I'm gonna be sick…

118
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,240
Which immunosuppressant do you take?

119
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,240
Immuno… what?

120
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,750
Wow, man…

121
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,080
You're psycho.

122
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,130
Hey, we passed the…

123
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,420
Oh my.

124
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,380
Listen, choom, the kid's got
an implant that'll fetch a nice price.

125
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,010
Just sit back, relax and--

126
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,260
What? You cut a deal
with the Scavengers or something?

127
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,020
Sit back or I'll take your chrome, too.

128
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,560
Sorry, David.

129
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,770
Looks like your cut's down to 20.

130
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,870
Let's go!

131
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,260
Whoops.

132
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,430
Hey, not dying, are ya?

133
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,770
Doc…

134
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:55,940
Huh?

135
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,520
Doc's clinic… Please… take…

136
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,030
David, buddy…

137
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,040
You look like shit.

138
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,210
Thanks…

139
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,920
How many times you use it?

140
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,290
Six… No, eight?

141
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,340
Jesus Henry Christ!

142
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,130
A grown-ass man
couldn't take that punishment.

143
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,220
I was fine…

144
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,430
But then my nose popped a cork.

145
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,180
This gonk didn't know about
immunosuppressants.

146
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,180
Didn't see the need.

147
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:39,270
Of course you didn't.
Just sell him the meds.

148
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,270
Shit off the shelf's not gonna cut it.
It'll cost ya.

149
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,780
You good for it?

150
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,530
You charging me?

151
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,780
Fucking right I am!
Ain't running no charity.

152
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,950
How much'll these buy?

153
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,910
Two days' worth.

154
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,460
That's it?

155
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,330
Plenty of other rippers out there.

156
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,880
Of course, that might land you
back with the Scavs.

157
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,970
Greedy bastard…

158
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,970
You really don't want it gone?

159
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,180
Nope.

160
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:18,690
Still can't believe it…
Eight times in one goddamn day.

161
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,980
You're either a total masochist or…

162
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:26,610
Listen. Don't use it more than
two times a day. Three max.

163
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,780
Even if your body can take it,
that egghead of yours can't.

164
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:34,240
Your brain's gonna get scrambled.

165
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,580
A single implant
could make me a cyberpsycho?

166
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,170
Never heard anything like that before.

167
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,500
Goes to show you…

168
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,010
just how dangerous that thing is.

169
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,020
All done?

170
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,320
Yeah.

171
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,860
Guess that's a wrap for today.

172
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,700
I can keep going.

173
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,030
No way, I'm not babysitting a cyberpsycho.

174
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,870
Only use the Sandevistan
when you really need to.

175
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,790
Lots of other ways to churn out eds.

176
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,000
Still willing to work with me
after all that?

177
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,920
Think I'd let you go
without being paid back first?

178
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,550
Well, good. I need the eddies.

179
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,840
That's the spirit.

180
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:40,060
Sure you're not up for more tonight?
I'm kinda lagging on rent.

181
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,850
No more today. Quit asking.

182
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,900
Okay…

183
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,440
Come with me.

184
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,450
I knew you wanted to!

185
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,280
Not work-related.

186
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,870
Huh?

187
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,490
Right here.

188
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,200
You, uh… live alone?

189
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,370
Yeah?

190
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,960
Huh.

191
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,170
Wait, are you nervous?

192
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,090
No.

193
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,750
Your first time?

194
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,760
No.

195
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,470
Hey, fuck off!

196
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,220
Take a seat.

197
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,890
I've only got beer. You drink?

198
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,470
Uh, yeah.

199
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,720
Cheers.

200
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,860
Seriously? You've never drunk before?

201
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,990
No, I have. It's just…

202
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,240
I don't like carbonated drinks or smokes.

203
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,910
Do people like that really exist?

204
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,250
I'm not lying.

205
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,160
Sure you aren't.
And what's up with that getup anyway?

206
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,670
Take it off.

207
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,210
What? Why?

208
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,210
Just do it. Come on.

209
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,130
H-Hey!

210
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,850
Don't mess with that…

211
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,680
Edgerunners?

212
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,140
It's another word for cyberpunk.

213
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,020
It's who you wanna be, right?

214
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,030
I'm actually a fan of JK's
"EDGERUNNERS" series.

215
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,280
You serious?

216
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,780
Look who's talking.

217
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,660
What's up with that tacky poster?

218
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,160
You got a problem?

219
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,040
Uh… no problem.

220
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,920
Just always whacked me how those ads
make it seem like some kind of paradise.

221
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,420
I mean, lots of peeps died trying to
turn that dumb rock into something useful.

222
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,050
Sounds more like a prison than paradise.

223
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,800
Sounds like someone did their homework.

224
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,970
The Academy teaches you things
they don't show in the ads.

225
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,020
As expected of a preppy Academy boy.

226
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,440
It's not like that.

227
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,320
Isn't it? Never caught a pleb
attending a 'Saka school.

228
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,530
It's not!

229
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,450
My mom and I, we weren't well off.

230
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,330
The Academy normally
wouldn't have taken me.

231
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,710
But my mom had to work real
damn hard to keep me in.

232
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:14,090
You wanna know the kicker though?
I knew from day one that I'd never belong.

233
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:17,550
Then why did you stick around for so long?

234
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:22,550
Good fucking question. Guess it's 'cause
Mom wanted me to get a 'Saka job,

235
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,470
climb the corporate ladder…

236
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,560
That was her wish… Or dream, I guess.

237
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,360
That's why.

238
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,820
That's not your dream, though.

239
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,730
Not my dream?

240
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,990
Well, yeah. You and your mom
are two different people.

241
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,320
Why should you need to work for her dream?

242
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,740
There's nothing wrong with that.

243
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,120
You have to find your own dream.

244
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,500
Sounds like you've found yours.

245
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,500
You're joking.

246
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:59,800
You called it a prison, but to me,
this city is a whole lot worse.

247
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,590
Here?

248
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,760
I just wanna go away as far as possible.

249
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,480
Lemme show you something.

250
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,660
Whoa! Check the resolution on this!

251
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,660
I can feel the fucking sun!

252
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,670
It connects through your personal link
to let you feel the sun's heat.

253
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,920
Of course, you'd burn to a crisp
if it was the real temperature,

254
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,420
so I made sure to tweak it down.

255
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,300
Want me to change it back?

256
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,300
No, this is fun!

257
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,810
You look ridiculous!

258
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,520
Pretty cool, huh?

259
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,230
This is amazing!

260
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,360
Isn't it?

261
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,820
Over here.

262
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,330
First time I've ever shown anyone this.

263
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,160
Oh… really?

264
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,380
So, like… why me?

265
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:43,420
No idea. Guess it just felt right.

266
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,090
You know…

267
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,680
I think we'd make a good team.

268
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,640
Yeah…

269
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,280
Huh?

270
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:14,240
Hate to break it to ya,
but that implant belongs to me.

271
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,120
I'll be taking it back now.
