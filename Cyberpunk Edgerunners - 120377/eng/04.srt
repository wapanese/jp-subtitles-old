1
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,460
Anything?

2
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,970
No one goes in or out.

3
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,300
Figures.

4
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,350
Faraday was right. He changed sites.

5
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,970
It was a lost cause.
Dropped the ball on this one.

6
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,480
Must be big if Arasaka's willing to
clean house over a stolen car.

7
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,060
If only that Faraday'd tell us
what the fuck we after.

8
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,730
This stinks of high-risk shit.

9
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,530
"The biggest fish is always
the one that got away"?

10
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,990
Want me to dig deeper into Tanaka?

11
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:47,620
Nah, sniffing around
‘Saka business is a fixer's job.

12
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,750
"You are being paid to check off
the boxes on my checklist."

13
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,880
Yeah, yeah.
I went ahead and sicced Kiwi on him.

14
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,720
I guess we'll see what we find.

15
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,010
So we're on hold for now?

16
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,510
We'll need to find a way to kill time…

17
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,640
Said yourself, right?

18
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,180
Alright, fine.

19
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,020
I'm here for Aldo.

20
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,640
Yeah? Who's asking?

21
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,440
Maine sent me.

22
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,270
Hah? You Davis?

23
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,820
Uh…

24
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,780
Huh?

25
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,150
I'm David.

26
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,070
Davis?

27
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,280
David! Not Davis! David!

28
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,330
The fuck you screaming for?!
I can hear you.

29
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:13,540
David? You're Pilar's carrier pigeon.

30
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,670
Pilar's?

31
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:21,420
Was you, wasn't it? The punk kid
who klepped and junked the ‘Saka limo?

32
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,220
Yeah… First time on the job.

33
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,680
Could've collected 5K for it at least
if you hadn't gone and trashed it to hell.

34
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,600
-I'll remember that next time.
-Huh?

35
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,100
I'll do better next time!

36
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,690
Next time, eh?

37
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,730
Guess we'll see if last time wasn't
a stroke of beginner's luck.

38
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,190
What do you mean?

39
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,990
Nothing personal.

40
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,330
Won't take long to see if
you're the shit or just a lil' shit stain.

41
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,540
Hear about that cyberpsycho up in Watson?

42
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,290
They just keep popping up.

43
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:59,840
Yeah, took out two NCPD on patrol.
Saw the scroll. It was damn bloody.

44
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,050
A single launcher hit
turned him into so much canned paste…

45
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,270
Hey David! How've you been?

46
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,440
Uh…

47
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,690
What's up? You need something?

48
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,940
Uh. Got this package here
from Maine for Pilar.

49
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,900
Oh…

50
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,320
Bro!

51
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,860
Bro?

52
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,030
Delivery from Maine!

53
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,280
Fucking finally!

54
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,410
You know how many of
the boys'd kill to get these cyberhands?

55
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,580
Preeem!

56
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,420
Need me to excuse you now, or…?

57
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,840
He have anything else for me to do?

58
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,630
Bro?

59
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,760
Yeah, fuck off. Tip him on his way out.

60
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,020
He's your errand boy!
Fork it over yourself, cheap-ass!

61
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:54,970
It's bulletproof!

62
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,690
So do I clock out now?

63
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,940
Uh… Looks that way.

64
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,480
Oh. Cool…

65
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,190
Whoa?! All this for a tip?!

66
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,700
You're adorable.

67
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,410
See you later, David.

68
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,800
You came?

69
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,470
You told me to come.

70
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,470
Maine bullied me into it.

71
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,470
Wha… Maine?

72
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,360
Asshole.

73
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,160
You're kidding.

74
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,660
You're telling me. It's my day off.

75
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,910
Sorry to hear it.

76
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,330
No offense, but you're not
exactly built like a punk.

77
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,300
You look like you'd tweak out
after one or two more implants.

78
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,800
I'm not that weak!

79
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,380
Keep up, then.

80
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,930
Ever use one?

81
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,230
No.

82
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,440
Gloria never let you carry?
Well, better start now than never.

83
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,070
Could teach ya if ya want.

84
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,240
Think I'll stick with the Sandevistan.

85
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,010
Hey.

86
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:54,930
Yes?

87
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,140
So, you're a netrunner?

88
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,470
Yeah. And?

89
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,810
Nothing. Just… do netrunners need to run?

90
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:07,360
Netrunner, edgerunner. No difference.
Stamina is everything.

91
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:40,100
Don't leave the house empty-handed
from now on, you hear me?

92
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,890
Every day. You check for your wallet,
your condom, and your gun.

93
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,190
Sure, some punks go straight chrome.

94
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:54,400
But it's gonna be a while before you can
stay alive with just your cyberware.

95
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,910
Until then, that gun's gonna be
your backup plan.

96
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,750
Hey.

97
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,790
Yes?

98
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,500
How old are you anyway?

99
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,990
How're things with Lucy?

100
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,030
Huh?

101
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,410
You treating her right?

102
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:46,000
No, I didn't mean… Well, your age
and skills don't really add up.

103
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,330
Skill has nothing to do with age.

104
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,290
It's all about hard work.

105
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,170
Besides, only idiots talk down to
people younger than them.

106
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,630
Like who?

107
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,430
Like long-armed techies.

108
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,830
What do you mean "treating her right"?

109
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,580
Wait… You still haven't done it?

110
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,960
What are we talking about exactly?

111
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,920
David, you're gonna need to
grow a pair of cajones

112
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,420
and I ain't just talking
in a cyberpunk sense.

113
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,220
Thought I saw you two
talking the other day.

114
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,310
At the party after the limo heist.

115
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,810
He likes to act like
my mentor or something.

116
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:53,810
He got grabby, so I fried him a bit
and told him to scram.

117
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,070
Huh.

118
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,820
How about you?

119
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,660
You serious about edgerunning?

120
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,580
I'm not into her like that.

121
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,330
C'mon kid, we've all got eyes.

122
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,800
She's not into me like that.

123
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,170
Yeah, probably.

124
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,480
Why are you asking?

125
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,400
You just don't seem the type.

126
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,980
Why?!

127
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,400
Tell me!

128
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,250
I just don't know how much of it was real.

129
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,000
What you mean?

130
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,580
Said she wants to go to the moon.

131
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,960
The moon?

132
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,170
Yeah, it's her dream or whatever.

133
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,700
You're faster than you look.

134
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,580
Yeah, yeah.

135
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,710
Really. Doubted you could keep up.

136
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,460
Sarcasm? I'm not that easy to get rid of.

137
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,460
Never said nothing about that to me.

138
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,540
So she lied?

139
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,960
Who knows? Just ask her.

140
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,380
She was probably just stalling me, but…

141
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:32,180
But we went to the moon together.
With her special BD.

142
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,100
You had a date on the moon?

143
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,350
Shit, you don't get much more
romantic than that in Night City.

144
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,240
Here, a training regimen.

145
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,330
This is just the bare minimum.
You're on your own after today.

146
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,830
If you're serious about this,
you'll need to keep up. And then…

147
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,710
And then?

148
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,150
How long has she been with you guys?

149
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,950
Been about a year? Kiwi brought her in.

150
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,820
Said she found a natural.

151
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,080
What about before that?

152
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,540
I don't know.
Like I said, ask her yourself.

153
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,370
I don't give two shits
about people's pasts

154
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,500
so long as they can pull their weight.

155
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,500
Thought you'd say that.

156
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,450
'Ey, keep it down!

157
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,240
Damn!

158
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,830
Jeez, that's loud.

159
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,750
Gross.

160
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,700
Seriously.

161
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,250
What's your problem, eh?

162
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,080
Why you pissing in the street?!

163
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,840
'Ey, homie! You hear me?!

164
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,210
Leave him alone.

165
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,340
Bye bro.

166
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,670
You aiming for hole-in-one?

167
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,720
I'm talking to ya! Ya hear me?!

168
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:39,730
Listen, we don't like
walking in piss, asshole.

169
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:44,650
Alright? This sidewalk belongs to us…

170
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:49,610
Oh, shit! That's one hell of an implant!

171
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:53,070
Gives whole new meaning to
the phrase "hard as ir--"

172
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,340
Hey…

173
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,850
Da…

174
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:23,060
vid…

175
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,230
move…

176
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,380
Not the time to freeze, kid!

177
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,510
Fucking capped him!

178
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,340
-Got bits of Pilar on me…
-Gimme that!

179
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,010
Fucker!

180
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,470
You had no fucking right!

181
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,720
Fucking psycho trash!

182
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,230
Stupid, you'll flatline
faster than you can land a shot!

183
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,730
Let me go!

184
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,150
Die!

185
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,410
Shit, of all times…

186
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,990
Kiwi! Reset Becca's system!

187
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,160
On it.

188
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,210
Where's Lucy?!

189
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,600
Hey, asshole!

190
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,480
David!

191
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,990
Lucy!

192
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,910
I'm alright.

193
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,000
Good.

194
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,000
You're bleeding…

195
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:23,390
I'm the only one
who was allowed to kill him…

196
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,940
Don't touch me.

197
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,900
Do you need medical?

198
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,940
No.

199
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,570
Dorio, take Lucy to see a ripperdoc.

200
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,910
I'll stay with Kiwi until the pigs arrive.

201
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,330
Someone's gotta explain this mess.

202
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,910
You heard him.

203
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,080
You go with 'em, kid.

204
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,040
Huh?

205
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,000
We'll tell 'em we took him
out after he zeroed Pilar.

206
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:58,510
They'll file it as a cyberpsycho incident,
but it's better that you ain't here.

207
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,420
But…

208
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,340
I saw what you did.

209
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,970
Time you stopped thinking like a rookie.

210
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:10,310
You lot again? I'm not actually
a licensed physicist, you know.

211
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,440
I didn't volunteer to come either.

212
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,150
Charming.

213
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,480
I'll go alone.

214
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,070
Clean her up and get her home.

215
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,200
-You're leaving?
-Maine said you could take his car.

216
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,000
Lucy.

217
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,220
-Here's fine.
-Sure.

218
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,220
Good night.

219
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:50,350
Um… Can we talk?

220
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,020
This way.

221
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,910
Aw. It's all cloudy.

222
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:07,030
That moon BD you showed me
was pretty sweet.

223
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,290
I had something
I wanted to talk about, too.

224
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,250
Oh?

225
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:21,420
I know how it must look but…
What I told you that day before?

226
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:24,640
I wasn't lying.
It was the first time I told anyone.

227
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,760
That's…

228
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,770
That's good.
I didn't want to think you were lying.

229
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,020
What if I'm lying now?

230
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,270
-I don't think you are.
-Why not?

231
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,020
-'Cause I don't like that.
-That's crazy.

232
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,650
You should've said something earlier.

233
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,400
I couldn't.

234
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,400
Why not?

235
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,660
You were so mad at me.

236
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,030
I wasn't mad.

237
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,030
Was too.

238
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,290
I wasn't mad, just…
Well, yeah. Guess I was.

239
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,540
See?

240
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,540
I was angry, but…

241
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,540
I wasn't pissed at you.

242
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,800
Wouldn't have saved you if I did.

243
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,550
-Liar.
-I'm not.

244
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,680
No, that's a lie.

245
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:11,220
You're the kind of guy who'll jump in fire
to save someone, even if you get burned.

246
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,520
You're that type.

247
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,900
Is that why you think I won't make it?

248
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,270
Maine thinks I will. Why can't…

249
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,820
No, it's not that. You'd make
a good edgerunner, I think.

250
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,570
I really do.

251
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,990
So what's the problem?

252
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,950
You don't make a name
as a cyberpunk by how you live.

253
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,620
You're remembered by how you die.

254
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,040
It's not the life or the end you deserve.

255
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:43,260
What makes me any different from you?

256
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,010
I have nowhere else to go.

257
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,380
I don't either.

258
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,180
You and I are worlds apart.

259
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,550
How?!

260
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,230
I'll take you to the moon!

261
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,690
I promise!

262
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,490
I just don't want you to die.

263
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,390
I won't.
