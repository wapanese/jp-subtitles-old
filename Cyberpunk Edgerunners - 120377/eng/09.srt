1
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,480
The cargo's coming into
the city from the east.

2
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,240
We're taking the whole vehicle.

3
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,910
Haul's two 'n' a half mil.

4
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,700
Pot o' gold with the usual split.

5
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,500
This one's definitely
the biggest job I've ever taken.

6
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,080
Target's a corp, ain't it?

7
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,880
Three guesses which one it is.

8
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,130
Arasaka, of course.

9
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,970
Half a mil a head's nice 'n' all,
but I ain't even sure if it's worth it.

10
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,050
Really think five of us is enough?

11
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,140
Security footprint
on the convoy's peculiarly small.

12
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,480
Arasaka's posted a limited crew to cast
a short shadow, keep a low profile.

13
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,940
We'll strike the metal where it's soft.

14
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,030
I dunno, man…

15
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,150
Let's not overthink this.

16
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,280
Smash, grab, deliver. It's what we do.

17
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,030
Business as usual.

18
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,740
Business as usual my ass.

19
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,540
You think he'll withstand
the cyberskeleton?

20
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,750
Arasaka does. After seeing his chemistry
mesh so well with the Sandevistan.

21
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:03,300
Tanaka wanted him back in the Academy
so he could test the cyberskeleton on him.

22
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,060
And this girl was trying to
bury that information

23
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,930
so no one would come after him.

24
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,860
That's how I see it.
Frying Tanaka tied up a loose end.

25
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,990
Maine and Dorio were just
collateral damage in her schemes.

26
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,280
That's one way of putting it…

27
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,780
So much carnage for one so petite.

28
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,080
How many did she kill just to save one?

29
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,800
Dove a little deeper and found that
she used to work for Arasaka.

30
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,890
They groomed her
to mine data in the Old Net.

31
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,060
Guess that's how she's been able to
get past Arasaka's ICE.

32
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,980
This is perfect.

33
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,940
What a wonderful surprise.
We can dangle her in front of Arasaka.

34
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,240
Our fast-lane ticket up
the corporate rungs!

35
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,200
Didn't see you as
such a simp corpo-climber.

36
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,200
Is that really so strange?

37
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,580
What are fixers
if not glorified pet owners

38
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,040
who keep their mercenary hounds well fed?

39
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,920
The only way to succeed in Night City
is to get in with the corporations.

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,210
I'll require your continued assistance.

41
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,130
Gonna make me keep digging
this hole deeper?

42
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,260
This is a great opportunity
for you as well.

43
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,810
I have corporate amnesty for
the Tanaka incident… But what about you?

44
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,640
You're as slimy as ever.

45
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,980
Let's play nice for old time's sake.

46
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:42,400
How often do we get to work with Arasaka
and stick it to Militech with one hand?

47
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,280
Arasaka wouldn't object.

48
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,450
I'll negotiate for your immunity
and commission.

49
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,040
Never trust a soul in Night City.

50
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,130
Trusting fools deserve
the hand they're dealt…

51
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,960
Is David a bargaining chip as well?

52
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,340
Naturally. I've conjured a plan.

53
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,430
I'll pitch them both to Arasaka.

54
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,070
What's up with the emergency meeting?

55
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,580
Faraday's come through.
It's our biggest gig yet.

56
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,080
Huge risk, huge return. Turn back now
if you're not ready to face the heat.

57
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,170
I'm counting on you too, Kiwi.

58
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,090
Sure.

59
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:49,010
Yo, granny and gramps
can bench this round.

60
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,760
Think your little chicken legs'll
reach the pedals?

61
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,310
Kiss my ass.

62
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,480
Give us the brief.

63
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,480
'Saka put on a small,
heavy-duty security squad.

64
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,270
But they'll split. Half'll go after
a diversion squad commissioned by Faraday.

65
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,610
Diversion squad?

66
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:11,370
A decoy, basically. Though that's probably
not in the brief Faraday gave them.

67
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,490
Oh.

68
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,950
Typical Faraday handiwork.

69
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,000
Of course, there's no way to tell
if we're also a decoy…

70
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,080
Bitch!

71
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,210
Good, good. We've got 'em
nice and split. What's the call?

72
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,920
Main target's off the road.
We've got the high ground.

73
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,840
Put her in gear, Falco!

74
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,420
Alright!

75
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,670
Let's hit it!

76
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,470
Hey, David. Car's all warmed and ready…

77
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,760
David!

78
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,140
Are these all immunosuppressants?

79
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:25,360
Can you fetch my mom's jacket for me?

80
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,480
We're calling off the gig!

81
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:31,280
Rebecca… I got a favor to ask…

82
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,860
You better knock it--

83
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:37,370
Becca, I can't ask anyone else…

84
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,010
Rebecca?

85
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,880
Puppy-dog eyes! Knew I'm
a sucker for the vulnerable, didn't ya?!

86
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,350
Don't use your fucking Sandevistan.
You hear me?

87
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,640
Okay, okay…

88
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,610
One down!

89
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,240
Alright, we're right on the target's ass!

90
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,660
I'll hack into the brake.

91
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,370
Hold on, we got a tail!

92
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,750
Can't even get a peek out there!

93
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,960
Leave it to me!

94
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,710
Hey! Don't use your Sandevistan…

95
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,100
Fucking deaf, that one?!

96
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,610
You're a real piece of work!

97
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,740
Damn you, David!

98
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,790
Everyone good?

99
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,210
Hey 'stache! Do we look good?!

100
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,500
Look.

101
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,090
It's still going?!

102
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,340
ICE is as thick as the armor.
Can't hack it.

103
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,550
Then I'll hit 'em from the front.

104
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,760
Seriously, knock it--

105
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,890
Fucking tired of being ignored!

106
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,440
…on autopilot!

107
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,230
So please.
Sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.

108
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,610
Not good.

109
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,870
-We'd better stop it fast before it falls.
-What?!

110
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,250
Alright… What are ya gonna do, David?

111
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,510
We're right on the edge…

112
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,470
Falco! Pull up closer!

113
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,180
Easier said than done…

114
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,350
What do we do?!

115
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,150
I'll shoot it if you won't!

116
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,740
That's right. Easy does it, David.

117
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,870
No one here to slap sense into you now.

118
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,830
Make a choice.

119
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,580
You're special, remember?

120
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,510
Brake!

121
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,850
Slam on 'em!

122
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,930
No way.

123
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,760
Th-That's how it's done.

124
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,350
Bit my tongue…

125
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,360
How nice.

126
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,740
They send an executive-class AV
to collect a street girl?

127
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,990
You really must be
their precious, lost toy.

128
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,210
Still no response from Lucy?

129
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,130
Ugh. What's one more runner
gonna do for us at this point?

130
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,880
You gonna pay her from your pot?

131
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,380
How's it going over there?

132
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,340
Few more minutes to break the lock.

133
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,510
Is it just me or does it bother you
that this carrier was unmanned?

134
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,100
You sure it's an Arasaka vehicle?

135
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,900
If you're so worried,
just take the cargo and go.

136
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,650
We're all waiting on you.

137
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:03,900
Quit the yapping and let's go get our car.

138
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:08,950
Sheesh. Didn't strike me back when
we were going after the carrier,

139
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:13,330
but we'd be fishes in a barrel
if anyone tried to shoot us out here.

140
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:19,420
Jesus, old man. Nervous fart like you
doesn't deserve that cowboy 'stache!

141
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,670
You'd go weak in the knees if I shaved.

142
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,010
Ew! Gonna kick it off!

143
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:28,430
Stop dodging, old man!

144
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,890
Looks like the decoy failed.
We've got company!

145
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:34,930
What?!

146
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,150
That a Basilisk?

147
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,400
And a missile carrier!

148
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,910
You're shitting me…

149
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,910
Militech!

150
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:09,050
What the fuck?!
Why're we being steamrolled by Militech?!

151
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,560
Faraday's a Militech-man, ain't he?

152
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,390
The fishiness is really starting to reek!

153
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:20,730
It's open!

154
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:21,980
That was quick!

155
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,320
Take cover inside. Hurry!

156
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,990
What in the seven hells is this…?

157
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,820
This is what Faraday paid Maine to find?

158
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,120
So what is it?

159
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,830
A cyberskeleton. Military implant.

160
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:41,000
Military…
You mean like David's Sandevistan?

161
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,460
From what I hear,
it's a whole different caliber.

162
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,590
Hey. This kid's Sandy ain't
nothing to turn your nose up at either.

163
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,300
First time I'm hearing about this.

164
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,180
Believe me or don't.

165
00:14:53,260 --> 00:15:00,100
Arasaka thinks they can overtake Militech
if this thing hits the market.

166
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,020
But they've kept its development
on the down-low.

167
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:08,610
Most of its information
was concentrated under Tanaka's wing.

168
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,910
I don't know how,
but Faraday got wind of this,

169
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:17,370
and promised to leak this tech to
Militech to get himself a nice deal.

170
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,120
Not every day you get to fly
above Night City at your leisure.

171
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:28,380
It must be a nice change of scenery
from your usual ice-filled baths.

172
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,220
What do you say?
Want to help me make your boy fly?

173
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,600
What?

174
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,890
Incoming call from Lucy.

175
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,810
Now is seriously not the time!

176
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,570
No time. Militech's coming.

177
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,320
How do you know that? Where are you?

178
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,660
They're after me too.

179
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:17,720
Lucy!

180
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,810
What did she say?

181
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,890
"Use the cyberskeleton
if you want to survive."

182
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,980
The fuck?

183
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,690
She didn't seem herself though.

184
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,730
Sure about that?

185
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:31,780
Someone's after her too.
I've gotta install it.

186
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,740
Whole truck's a mobile installation unit.

187
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,120
That deck's got the installer all set up.

188
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,410
You are not gonna install this thing!

189
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,080
I gotta get us out of this!

190
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,670
Are you insane?! You don't even know
what this hunk of metal can do!

191
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,750
I don't see any other option.

192
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,920
Besides me knocking you the fuck out?!

193
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,260
I'm gonna go get our car.

194
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,180
I'll go with.

195
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,510
Thanks!

196
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:01,060
Last time I installed something that
wasn't mine, Maine beat the shit outta me.

197
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,180
Some things just don't change!

198
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:08,110
Don't! Wait…

199
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,450
You fucking gonk!
Why don't you ever listen?!

200
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:25,210
What's Militech waiting for?

201
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,710
Kiwi, you able to get eyes on…

202
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,790
Sorry.

203
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,520
What?!

204
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,930
Did you truly think
we would put no failsafe in place?

205
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,570
Shall I open a second neural port
in the back of your skull?

206
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,080
-I'm afraid she's currently indisposed.
-Faraday?!

207
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,580
I trust the job is going well?

208
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,090
Fuck you, put Lucy back on!

209
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:58,420
This chairjock bitch should feel grateful
to be kissing the ground.

210
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:02,890
I was worried I might've
overscrambled her brain.

211
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,180
Take your fucking foot off her!

212
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,600
Don't be so serious.
I'm just having a ball of a time.

213
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,110
Besides, I won't have to lift a finger
when Arasaka's done with her.

214
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,860
Faraday!

215
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,360
You're rapidly degenerating!

216
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,200
At this rate, you're gonna
go psycho in seconds!

217
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,830
Elite Militech forces are closing in.

218
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:30,210
Install the soft, use the cyberskeleton,
David. Lead your crew to safety.

219
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:36,210
Personally, I think it's beyond you.
Clearly Arasaka sees something I don't.

220
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:43,010
If you're truly so special, boy,
show me what you can do. Survive.

221
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,350
I'll kill him! I'm gonna go kill him!

222
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,350
I'll kill him! I'll kill him…

223
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,980
I'm gonna fucking--

224
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,440
You okay?

225
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,110
I'm gonna go save Lucy.

226
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,410
Uhh… Nope, I think your brain's fried.

227
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:09,490
Faraday's double-crossed us.
He's got Lucy.

228
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,410
Huh? What do you mean?

229
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,580
That fucker.
I'm gonna fucking put him in the ground!

230
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,710
I swear, he's gonna fucking die…

231
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,630
David…

232
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,220
Falco! What happened?

233
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,930
Kiwi got me.

234
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:23,880
What?!

235
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,180
She led us into a trap.

236
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,220
Oh, that hag. She's in it too?

237
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,480
She's a fucking flatline
when I see her next!

238
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,400
Here we go again!

239
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,860
Shit!

240
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,110
Militech's really out to kill us!

241
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,990
I've never seen anything like this.

242
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,290
How can anyone walk with this on?

243
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:56,120
Two compact thrusters're built in.
Same kind you get on an AV.

244
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:00,960
On top of that, Arasaka engineered in
a gravity modification prototype.

245
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:08,350
It can generate unidirectional
grav fields, magnetic forces, too…

246
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,100
That's the magnetic force generator?

247
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,110
Hot damn!
He just mowed a small squad down!

248
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,440
He's using his Sandevistan, too.

249
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,050
He's flying!

250
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,800
That's the gravitational field?

251
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,520
But this tech hasn't left
its testing stage.

252
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,150
The controls are too complex.

253
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:03,820
There's no guarantee that the equipper's
nerves will be able to withstand it.

254
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,610
It requires an insane level
of mental fortitude against implants.

255
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,620
A one-way ticket to
cyberpsychosis, you mean.

256
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,880
They got him?!

257
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,880
David…

258
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,640
He's still going!

259
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,980
His body is, but…

260
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:43,320
The more he uses it, the closer he will be
to overloading his cyberware capacity.

261
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,200
But in exchange, the short-term
power it generates is…

262
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:55,410
unlike anything devised
on this side of sanity.

263
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,250
David?

264
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,470
We're going after Faraday
for betraying us.

265
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,310
And we're gonna save Lucy.

266
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,020
You say that but…

267
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,980
Equal share of the pot.

268
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,440
That's my style.

269
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,860
Alright, buddy.

270
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,700
Onwards to hell.
