1
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,470
The Basilisk's down!

2
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,730
What's he got equipped?!
This wasn't in the brief!

3
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,230
The fixer fed us false info!

4
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,730
-We're done for…
-Call for back-up!

5
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,980
He's running!

6
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,730
He's headed for Night City.

7
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,070
Don't let Arasaka
take back the cyberskeleton!

8
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,450
So? Where we headed?

9
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,490
Arasaka!

10
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,580
Arasaka… City Center?!

11
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,490
Yeah!

12
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,120
Why Arasaka?!

13
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,910
We're saving Lucy!

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,210
Why's she with Arasaka?!

15
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:13,800
Faraday said she's part
of his deal with them…

16
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,130
I gotta close my eyes a bit…

17
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,720
Again?! Shit, the meds
are wearing off faster…

18
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,220
We've got some Militech company.

19
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,890
Shake them off! David's benched for five.

20
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,940
What?!

21
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,230
-Now?!
-Yeah.

22
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,360
Fine. Five minutes? I'll buy him a nap.

23
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,900
Take the front!

24
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,990
Alrighty, let's get this show on the road!

25
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,100
Way to go, old man!

26
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,430
Nice going!

27
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,190
Shit, another swarm ahead!

28
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,520
Arasaka's up next!

29
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,320
Okie-dokie! Barrel on through!

30
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,280
Not against that number.
We're getting off.

31
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,200
What?! Come on!

32
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,700
Militech's forces are nearly gone.

33
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,490
The target's entered Night City
and our recovery team's on him.

34
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,160
This is going to be hell to cover up…

35
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,710
This is what we get
for putting all our chips on a fixer…

36
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:41,420
According to path calculations, there's
a 74% chance that he's headed here.

37
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,590
Here? Why?

38
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,510
Can't say. He shouldn't even
know that we're involved.

39
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,310
Damn. Get in contact
with internal security.

40
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,690
Ma'am? The higher ups will be alerted.

41
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,860
Better to stir up a storm
and hide in the dust.

42
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,610
Damn it, Faraday…
Nothing is going according to plan.

43
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:08,120
Imagine me, a lowly street fixer, meeting
with Arasaka intel inside their own tower.

44
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,870
It's quite the breakthrough,
wouldn't you say?

45
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,500
All who live in this city
should aspire to climb high.

46
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,460
This is but a stepping stone on my way up.

47
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,310
What am I doing…

48
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,610
End of the line!

49
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,280
Wakey, wakey David!

50
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,820
Don't ask where these come from.

51
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,530
Nine times the dosage
of those military-issued meds.

52
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:17,410
It'll force you to stay sane,
but the side effects'll stack.

53
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,790
By the time ya hit the last vial…

54
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,880
Whatever's left of ya, Davey…

55
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,470
You'll slingshot the other way,
straight over the edge.

56
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,660
Woo-hoo!

57
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,790
Damn. They just keep coming!

58
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,810
Oh shit!

59
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,370
I want you to work hard, rise up,

60
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:41,620
and get to the top floor of Arasaka Tower!

61
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,630
I know you got it in you, Dee.

62
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,800
Mom!

63
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:57,720
Thanks, mom. I'll do it.
To the top floor of Arasaka Tower…

64
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,810
Okay.

65
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,270
Let's go. All the way to the top.

66
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,900
I got special meds from Doc.

67
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,820
If I look like I'm losing it,
I need you to shoot me up…

68
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,530
So I can keep it together.

69
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,700
I don't think the meds'll
work on him anymore.

70
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,620
Seriously? What do we do?

71
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,790
We're going to 'Saka!
There's no other option.

72
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,420
But with David like that?

73
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,920
We need Lucy!

74
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,420
What?

75
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,800
She's… the only one
that might be able to bring him back.

76
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,050
I can't think of anyone else that could!

77
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,940
I'm not doing any more jobs for you.

78
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,060
I see…

79
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,560
I understand.

80
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:57,070
My contract stipulates that I get rid of
anyone who knows about the cyberskeleton.

81
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,950
No exceptions… Not even for you.

82
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,710
Go! After her!

83
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,710
We're getting closer to
the Tower! What's our plan?

84
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,960
When do we ever have a plan?!

85
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,090
David! Do that thing again!

86
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,930
Woo-hoo!

87
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,600
Die! Have some of this!

88
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,570
Persistent bastards!
Cut us a break already!

89
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,660
We lose them?

90
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,450
Most of 'em!

91
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,200
MaxTac!

92
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,080
They sent three AVs?!

93
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,790
They flagged him as a cyberpsycho already?

94
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:53,460
We're all fucked
if David doesn't get his shit together!

95
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,380
You don't say!

96
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:01,720
MaxTac was dispatched to dispose of him
as a cyberpsychosis case.

97
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,310
What a nightmare…

98
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,390
This has grown far beyond
our original means.

99
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,310
The boy. We need to stop him
before he makes matters worse.

100
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,900
It's impossible. No one can stop him.

101
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,740
We must wait
for the implant to wear him down.

102
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,410
There is one person who can.

103
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,620
Who?

104
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,370
Adam Smasher.

105
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,410
Y-You're joking.

106
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,910
No, though I'd rather not
have had it come to this.

107
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,710
But even if you summon him now…

108
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,340
That's not a problem.

109
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,500
He's already here.

110
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,590
The cyberskeleton
was originally designed for him.

111
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,510
It's poetic that he should be
the one to end it.

112
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,810
Drop out. Get gone.

113
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,850
Afraid of getting caught?

114
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,810
'Cause I sure ain't.

115
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,820
Fuck you, MaxTac! Come and get us!

116
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,280
What the hell? Hey! Shit!

117
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,290
You're just gonna leave us here?!

118
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,540
Mom!

119
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,590
Is he even human?

120
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,930
Keep shooting!

121
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,390
Hold fire! New orders from Arasaka.

122
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,180
Code A.S. We're retreating.

123
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,100
What?

124
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,850
Rebecca… How many vials are left?

125
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,400
Just one more.

126
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,610
Finally at the end of the rope…

127
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,820
Kiwi?!

128
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,870
Huh?! Two-timing bitch!
I'll fucking kill you!

129
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,800
…Faraday's turn to be betrayed now.

130
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,810
Kiwi has been disposed of.

131
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,560
Nasty business…

132
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,450
Hey!

133
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,040
It can't be… David?!

134
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,630
Don't stop till we reach the loading dock!

135
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,260
Faraday will soon be
arriving with the runner.

136
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,600
As I thought,
Martinez must be after our fixer, not us.

137
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,720
I'll order the AV to turn around.

138
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:38,980
No, keep them on course for the dock.
You'll meet them there.

139
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,400
I'll meet them?

140
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:47,280
Someone's going to have to
take the fall for all this mess,

141
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,910
and that person is not me.

142
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,160
Do you understand?

143
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:57,210
Make sure that mangy fixer
never makes it past the loading dock.

144
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:05,920
You're up against the cyberskeleton.
Think you might have some fun, Smasher?

145
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:11,300
It's a child's toy
reliant on antigrav training wheels…

146
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,310
Not even worth my time.

147
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,060
Kill him!

148
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,560
Fire!

149
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,940
Where is he?!

150
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,320
No one's there!

151
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,410
Mom…

152
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,780
Look, I'm at the top of Arasaka Tower.

153
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,790
Well, this is the last one, Doc…

154
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:46,510
Once you've gone off the edge,
there's no coming back.

155
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,550
Doesn't matter how special you are.

156
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,890
But that's why I gotta go.

157
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,680
'Cause I've got nothing left now.

158
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,480
Seems to me like someone
didn't follow the plan, Faraday.

159
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:10,490
I brought the girl alive. I believe
our agreed price was one million?

160
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,700
We don't deal with dogs
that run off-leash.

161
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,750
Do you know what happens to
the ones that leave their cages?

162
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:22,750
Is that a threat? Don't you need
the data inside this cranium?

163
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:27,500
I can't allow you to take
a single step further in this building.

164
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,010
I would say that's very unwise.

165
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:36,010
With all the information I have,
it'd be a loss not to keep me on payroll.

166
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,730
Leave the girl and get out.
We'll send the payment as agreed.

167
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:47,070
We have no further use for you if you
can't give us data on the cyberskeleton…

168
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,120
Lucy…

169
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,910
David…

170
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,310
See that?

171
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,100
I even delivered the cyberskeleton…

172
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,820
You aren't gonna die that easily.

173
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,910
Adam Smasher?!

174
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,490
Kill him!

175
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,080
Who the fuck are you?

176
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,920
You're a merc! Do your fucking job!

177
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,920
My business is with the kid.

178
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,960
Adam Smasher?

179
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,720
So you're Adam Smasher?
Boogeyman of legend?

180
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,430
You're packing some heavy artillery
for your size there, cyberpunk.

181
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,480
Impressive that you're still able to talk.

182
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,190
Likewise, choom.
Heard you went no organic, full cyborg.

183
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,230
You still got a brain in there?

184
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,190
You could say I'm special.

185
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,610
Well so the fuck am I!

186
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,490
That a joke?

187
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,120
Trauma Team!

188
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,370
Thank god…

189
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,500
Can you afford to be distracted?

190
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,040
David! David, can you hear me?

191
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,750
It's me, Lucy!

192
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:11,250
David, come back to me! Come back…

193
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,770
Lucy…

194
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,770
David…

195
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,480
You installed it.

196
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,030
I knew you would…

197
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,490
And I knew you would die if you did.

198
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:44,910
I didn't want any of this.
Didn't want you to die…

199
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:51,290
This is the only way I could
protect you from this city.

200
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,340
I couldn't save mom or Maine,

201
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,170
but I wanted to save you.

202
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:06,680
But you never had to save me.
All I ever wanted was for you to live.

203
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:11,400
I don't matter.
I don't have anything left.

204
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,110
You have a dream.
I need you to see it through for me.

205
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,450
That's my dream.
Everything else doesn't matter.

206
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,720
When do you think
those Ara-suckers will give up?

207
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:52,520
NCPD's out there with them.
It's not gonna be for a while.

208
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,770
Man, I'm almost out of ammo…

209
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,450
We made it.

210
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,280
Took long enough, gonkbrain.

211
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,200
Shut the fuck up!

212
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,330
Falco. Got a favor to ask you.

213
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,290
Alright, time to retreat!

214
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,960
Glad you're back safe.

215
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,340
For David's sake, I mean.

216
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,630
We're having a moment--

217
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,480
Rebecca!

218
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,450
Damn you…

219
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,790
You have a Sandevistan?!

220
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,920
It's a rudimentary implant.

221
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,290
I'm the one you're after!

222
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,590
All the same meat to me.
I'll slaughter each and every one of you.

223
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,220
Not if I kill you first!

224
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,140
Out of meds?

225
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,190
Right on schedule, I'd say.

226
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,310
David!

227
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,780
What?!

228
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,370
Falco… David's still back there…

229
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,500
Falco!

230
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,130
None leave the slaughterhouse alive.

231
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,130
Distracted much?

232
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,880
You…

233
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:49,010
Who are you… to challenge me…

234
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:53,770
When you can't even stand
without your antigrav crutches?

235
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,770
Think you're special
'cause you're scrappy?

236
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,360
Don't make me laugh!

237
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,990
Falco! Turn back…

238
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,910
No.

239
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,530
David asked me.

240
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,290
If I go back now…
he'd have died for nothing.

241
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,290
I've got the commission money.

242
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,040
He wants it split between us.

243
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,050
He also told me to tell ya…

244
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,050
Sorry. Wish we could go
to the moon together.

245
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,720
I had fun after all.

246
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,730
You know, you could prove
an interesting construct.

247
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:23,360
Like I… give a shit…

248
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:27,400
Alright. Well then.

249
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,020
Welcome to the tour of the moon!

250
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,360
Experience lunar gravity
like nothing you've seen on a BD…

251
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,630
Whoa! Check this!

252
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,380
I can feel the fucking sun!
