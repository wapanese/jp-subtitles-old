1
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,930
What are we gonna do?

2
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,190
Fucking Sandy's mine.
Why's this runt even got it chipped?

3
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,110
Uninstall's gonna cost us a hot eddie.

4
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,490
Fuck! Meddling kid's
more trouble than he's worth.

5
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,360
What if we ice him?

6
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,570
How much would we save
taking it off his dead back?

7
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,370
Won't change that much.

8
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,740
But it'd be cheaper?

9
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,450
Just barely.

10
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,250
Hear that? I should just
rip the damn thing off myself.

11
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,250
Teach you not to steal people's shit.

12
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,710
Don't make a mess in my room.

13
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,630
Stay outta this!

14
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,510
Excuse me? I'm the one that found him.

15
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,010
You lied to me?

16
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,310
Shut up.

17
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,060
What the fuck are you doing
with my Sandevistan?

18
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,190
Your…?

19
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,440
Yeah, the one I bought from my supplier.

20
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,780
Except the moment I paid,
she fucking ghosted.

21
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,820
That's what you get for paying upfront.

22
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,990
Dumbass.

23
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:39,900
Shut it!

24
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,450
She's our people!
Said she needed cash real fast.

25
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,330
Guess everyone's a grifter nowadays.

26
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,330
Wait.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,660
Your supplier's…

28
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,880
Gloria Martinez. Ring a bell?

29
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,170
She's my mom.

30
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,300
You're Gloria's kid?
The hell's she doing, giving it to you?

31
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,800
She died.

32
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,300
Just yesterday.

33
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,100
Yesterday? I was just
talking to her two days ago.

34
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,230
What happened?

35
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,690
The fuzz get her?

36
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,350
Car accident.

37
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,190
Some kinda gangoon drive-by…
Got caught in the crossfire.

38
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,860
Nothing to do with the Sandevistan.

39
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,450
Ow!

40
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,910
Checks out why she never called back.

41
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,450
Condolences, kid. But…

42
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,580
Don't think this lets you off the hook.

43
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,960
I didn't know it was yours.

44
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,750
Even so…

45
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,970
What kinda gonk just installs an implant
not knowing who it belonged to?

46
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,220
Kid's outta his damn mind!

47
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,470
He didn't know what he was doing.

48
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,480
You guys… are cyberpunks?

49
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,610
What's it to ya?

50
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,360
Let me keep the Sandy.

51
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,740
I'll pay you back one job at a time.

52
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,740
Not good enough. That's military-grade.

53
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,910
Can't just buy it off the shelf.

54
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,870
I'll pay you back what you paid my mom.

55
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,000
No deal.

56
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,790
Don't start cutting him up here.

57
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,670
Let me run jobs for you.

58
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,510
Now that's funny.
What am I gonna do with an amateur?

59
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,300
I can use the implant.

60
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,430
No way. Kid can't boot
the thing without keeling over.

61
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,390
You might be surprised.

62
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,230
Body his size would sizzle after two hits.

63
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,020
I did eight.

64
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,900
C'mon. That's bull and we all know it.

65
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,530
Yeah? Why don't I show you?

66
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,530
Sit your ass down, kid.

67
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,320
Chill. Just gonna klep his cig.

68
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,830
That's all…

69
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,700
Wha?

70
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,920
That makes it nine times today…
Or is that ten?

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,920
Well, fuck me. This kid's crazy!

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,380
Give me a chance.

73
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,920
Chance? What chance?

74
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,550
Take me on a job.

75
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,470
I'll make it worth your time.

76
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,820
Some balls you got there, kid.

77
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,820
Fine. One chance.

78
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,450
Here we go again.

79
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,660
I owe it to Gloria.

80
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,540
Thanks, you won't--

81
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,120
Hey…

82
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,210
Chill. Just slotting a tracer.

83
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,130
Don't want you to go AWOL on us.

84
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,380
I ain't gonna run.

85
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,090
Yeah, yeah. That's what they all say.

86
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,590
You'll be hearing from me tomorrow.

87
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,520
So those are the guys you roll with.

88
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,640
Yeah.

89
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,980
You could've said--

90
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,770
I didn't plan this at first.

91
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,650
Maine wouldn't shut up
about his prized Sandy going missing…

92
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,360
And saw you using it.

93
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,990
Looked into it and realized
you had the one.

94
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,120
Then you held me here 'til they showed…

95
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,710
Lied this whole time.

96
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,420
Just go home already.

97
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,130
Fine.

98
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,510
About your mom…

99
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,430
Sorry for your loss.

100
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:19,020
This is an exceptionally rare opportunity
and a great honor. Congratulations.

101
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,390
However,

102
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:26,730
there is still the matter of your recent
violent behavior on Academy grounds.

103
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:31,320
Now, I spoke with Mr. Tanaka
and he has graciously agreed

104
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,620
to strike several demerits from
your record should you offer an apology.

105
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,830
For details, please--

106
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,800
Over here, kid.

107
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,100
Morning, sunshine.

108
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,560
Data wasn't lying. He is just a kid.

109
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,810
Can he keep up?

110
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,860
We'll see.

111
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,780
Now, I know he's a sweet thing,

112
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,690
but don't go getting all soft on him.

113
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,610
Why do we even put up with you?

114
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,870
This is Kiwi. You've met Dorio and Pilar.

115
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,500
Take a seat.

116
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,710
I'm David--

117
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,620
Shut up.

118
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,920
Straight to business.

119
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,880
Slot the shard.

120
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,260
Say hello to Arasaka Corp driver
and bodyguard…

121
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,550
Maxim.

122
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,560
We're gonna swipe the navigation data
from the limo he drives.

123
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,100
The data? Not the limo?

124
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,230
We take the limo and Arasaka'll
set their ninjas on us like flies on shit.

125
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,360
No. We're only after the data.

126
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,650
How?

127
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,150
Betting on boxing is
this guy's sole joy in life.

128
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,320
You can bet his ass is in
one of those seats every weekend.

129
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,540
Always puts a stack on the Butcher,

130
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,540
banking on her skull-splitting uppercut.

131
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:12,130
Safe to say most people only go to see her
beat the shit out of the other boxers.

132
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,550
Except…

133
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:26,270
This weekend
the bitch is going down in round one.

134
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,650
How do you know that?

135
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,410
We just do.

136
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,290
He always drowns his sorrows
at this hole-in-the-wall when he loses.

137
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,790
You make your move
when he's three sheets to the wind.

138
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,350
Get the key and hand it off to Dorio.

139
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,100
She'll make a copy.

140
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:08,190
Then we sneak in and steal the navi data,
all while the corpo's still shit-faced.

141
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,810
Leave that bit to us,

142
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,690
but you'll have to get the key
back into his slot without him noticing.

143
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,780
And that's all there is.

144
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,180
Watch it!

145
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,850
Oh my gosh, I'm sorryyy.

146
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,230
I'll take care of it.

147
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,230
Get in.

148
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,330
You got this?

149
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,620
Shh. Focusing.

150
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,380
Arasaka's security
is such a pain in the ass.

151
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,210
Sorry again, dude!

152
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,510
That's alright, sweetheart.

153
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,050
I'll make it up to you next time.

154
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,220
Thieving bitch!

155
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,760
Huh? What do you mean?

156
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,890
You're so scary!

157
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,890
We're blown. Target's coming in hot.

158
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,770
-Status?
-Just a lil' more.

159
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,230
Time's up. Cut it!

160
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,360
Almost…

161
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,530
Done.

162
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,150
It won't open!

163
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,700
Open up! You piece of shit!

164
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,600
Hey! Stop! My car!

165
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,810
-I'll put in the route.
-Thanks.

166
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,350
Think we can do it?

167
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,860
All up to you now.

168
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,610
Look at you, Mr. Chauffeur.

169
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,570
I'm a natural.

170
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,070
Maybe, if the autopilot wasn't on.

171
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,830
Whatever.

172
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,830
Got company.

173
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,210
Tyger Claws?!

174
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,460
Maxim must've put up a bounty.

175
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,380
Already?

176
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,340
That's why you don't fuck with corpos.
They got more control here.

177
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,050
Get on the highway.

178
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,640
Why ya running, choom?!

179
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,180
Come back and fight, cowards!

180
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,600
Where ya going?!

181
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,520
Gonna lose them soon.

182
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,600
Shit. Traffic?!

183
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,020
Oh my…

184
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,230
Not good.

185
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,120
They're gaining on us.

186
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,630
Slow-ass!

187
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,130
-Strap up!
-Huh?

188
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,480
Get back here,
you murdering son of a bitch!

189
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,540
You're dead!

190
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,030
It's closed.

191
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,690
They should be here by now.

192
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,570
Well, at least the jammer is holding up.

193
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,530
When did the door unlock?

194
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,330
A long while ago.

195
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,250
Stay here. I'll check it out.

196
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:35,350
Come on now, don't run away.
Let's play a lil' more!

197
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,790
Die!

198
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,210
I'll make you bleed!

199
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,330
Ew…

200
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,580
Sorry for the wait.

201
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,300
Check this!

202
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,310
Well, not too bad for a rookie.

203
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,980
We cool now?

204
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,940
Welcome to the club.

205
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,480
But don't forget, kid.

206
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:17,110
There ain't no one in this world
you can trust more than yourself.

207
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,540
Don't use us as crutches, or you'll die.

208
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,870
Okay.

209
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:36,130
Check out the precision, chooms!
Can't beat these fingers!

210
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,140
From what I hear, those fingers
do a whole lotta beating.

211
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,680
What's that supposed to mean?

212
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,230
I'll give you a test drive
if you're asking for one!

213
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,980
Thanks.

214
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,530
Immunosuppressants.
About one month's worth.

215
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,700
And…

216
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,870
Your cut.

217
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,580
This is a lot.

218
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,870
Everybody gets a fair shake.
Only way I operate.

219
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,000
You still mostly organic?

220
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,920
Huh?

221
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,960
Once you have enough dough,
start fixing yourself up.

222
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,340
Skin 'n' bone won't be able to
keep up with the Sandevistan.

223
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,180
You're right.

224
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,680
Could've made easy work of that Tyger Claw

225
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,560
or any of the trash out there.

226
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:32,150
It ain't wasted ennies if it makes
you stronger. That's what I say.

227
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,570
Be it chrome…

228
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,230
or my crew.

229
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,870
Shit…

230
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:04,260
I believe I requested
the navigation data, not the limo.

231
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,720
We got what you asked for.

232
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:10,060
What I asked for was discretion.

233
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,810
We tried, but you know how things can be.

234
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,440
Had to improvise.

235
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,990
It was imperative to find
where Tanaka frequents.

236
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,490
So break down the navi and you'll know.

237
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,660
He has already changed sites.

238
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,120
Your joyride puts us back at square one
and put Tanaka on high alert.

239
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,750
Changed sites for what?

240
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,370
That is not for you to know.

241
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,630
Damn it! How we supposed to do the job
if you keep us in the dark?

242
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:40,300
The less information you have,
the lower the risk for us.

243
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,220
Get that through your head.

244
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,890
You are not being paid to think.

245
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,220
You are being paid to check off
the boxes on my checklist.

246
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:52,900
It is my place to see the larger picture,
it is yours to listen.

247
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,150
Are we clear?

248
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,740
Yeah. No problems here.

249
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,990
Good. Now will wait until
the target lets his guard down again.

250
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,740
I'll be in touch.

251
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,160
Yeah. Sure.

252
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,040
Who was that?

253
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,630
Faraday. He brought us this job.

254
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,670
He's also the best fixer around.

255
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,050
I thought you were the boss.

256
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,680
I'm the one that gets shit done.
He's the one who pays us.

257
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:35,310
If you ain't got cash, you ain't nothing
in this business. Easy and simple.

258
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,400
Don't think too hard on it.

259
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,690
We're celebrating today.

260
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,760
Yo.

261
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,140
Sorry, you're…

262
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,730
You don't remember me?!
After all we've been through…

263
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,650
You were at the bar.

264
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,030
You like my performance?

265
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,440
Sure.

266
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,490
I'm Rebecca. I heard you're
joining Maine's team?

267
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:31,240
Probably. Is this carbonated?

268
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:36,080
Cheers! Then I guess I'll be seeing
a lot more of you.

269
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,500
Cheers.

270
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,270
Uh, it's fine.

271
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,310
I trust you received the message I left?

272
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,100
Yeah, I got it.

273
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,770
Excellent. Now, about your
apology to Mr. Tanaka--

274
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,150
Pass this along to Katsuo for me.

275
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,030
Er, perhaps you should--

276
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:10,780
If he wants revenge, I'll be waiting.
But I'm done going easy.

277
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,830
You can all kiss my ass.
