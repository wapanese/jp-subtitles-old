1
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,930
Director Evans.

2
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,810
What? Where did you come from?

3
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,520
I'm sorry, sir. I did knock a few times…

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,230
Fine, fine… What do you want?

5
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,990
Um… May I go home for the day?

6
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,320
I'm sorry, sir.
I had plans for this evening…

7
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,200
I hadn't realized that managing
your schedule was also my job.

8
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,000
N-No, sir. It's just…

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,830
I wanted to celebrate
my son getting into the Academy…

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,920
Oh! Well, that's wonderful. We all
look forward to another legacy hire.

11
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,800
Just find someone to fetch the UG2 sample.

12
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,010
Everyone has already
gone home at this hour…

13
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,600
I'll bring over the sample myself… so…

14
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:10,650
How very kind of you.
Fetch it and get out of my sight.

15
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,500
Director Evans?

16
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,010
Wait…

17
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,390
What happened in there?

18
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,310
Lost you for a sec.
Someone raise a jammer?

19
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,520
Transmission was stable.

20
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,150
Weird.

21
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,950
Yeesh, what a boring gig.

22
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,670
They trespassed on Arasaka premises,
hit us in our own fucking facility.

23
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,920
The lab's research focused
on Militech countermeasures.

24
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,140
Is this related to the runner
who flatlined Jamie and Marcus?

25
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,510
Evans was murdered by a bullet…

26
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,390
This was sloppy, violent.
Safe to say, not the same runner.

27
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,690
Apprehending the netrunner's our priority.
They're too dangerous.

28
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,690
But we know neither
their motive nor purpose…

29
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,860
Whoever they are, they're cautious.

30
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,530
Not your average runner looking to score.

31
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,700
We're Arasaka Counterintel.
We never deal with average.

32
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,040
We'll need to take a detour
to catch the runner's trail.

33
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,120
Are we going after Evans' killer?

34
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,960
It's two separate roads.
We may get lucky and find that they merge.

35
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,510
Let's switch it up.
We'll go after the fixer.

36
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,300
Who do we know that has ties to Militech?

37
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,390
But if the fixer we get
has ties to the runner,

38
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,980
they could turn around and leak info
about the product to Militech.

39
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,440
They'd be a poor fixer
if they weren't a self-serving bastard.

40
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,780
But at the end of the day,
they're only glorified corporate lapdogs.

41
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:50,740
We'll just remind them
whose hand they eat off of in this city.

42
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,000
How would you go about this?

43
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,790
We tell them
in the only language this city speaks.

44
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,470
Hey…

45
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,100
Take the fixer! Kill the others!

46
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,230
Grenade!

47
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
Go! Go!

48
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,000
I was very nearly killed.

49
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,800
What makes you think it was Arasaka?

50
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,630
Do you take me for a fool?
Who else could it have been?

51
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,010
We're not paying
for any additional liabilities.

52
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,390
And corporate immunity
is still off the table.

53
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,640
Are you serious?!

54
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,400
We're already in the red
with your slip-up on the Tanaka case.

55
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,400
With nothing to show for it.
We expect returns on our investments.

56
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,030
Want more resources? Show us results.

57
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,280
And what the hell do you think
I've been chasing?

58
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,660
You're running out of time.
Our patience is running thin.

59
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,170
Arasaka's security
is on higher alert than usual.

60
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,840
Goes to show just how important
the cyberskeleton is to them.

61
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,170
You expect too much.

62
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:30,340
Don't lecture me on the stakes
with all the money we've invested in this.

63
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,350
Not another enny until you earn it.
We're done here.

64
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,480
Damn corporate brat…

65
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,330
The fixer's made contact.

66
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,450
As I predicted.

67
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,080
What a good little dog.

68
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,710
David?

69
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,590
Oh, my bad.

70
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,300
Did I wake you up?

71
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,810
Can't sleep?

72
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,560
Couldn't shut my brain off.

73
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,180
Oh.

74
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,100
I'll turn it off.

75
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,730
Aren't you watching?

76
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,810
No, I just had it on…

77
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,730
Oh.

78
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,360
250K to the Moon…
Huh, cheaper than I thought.

79
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,360
For a one-way ticket.

80
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,490
Well, yeah.

81
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,870
You remembered…

82
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,000
Huh?

83
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,210
Nothing. I'm going back to bed.

84
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,620
Okay. 'Night.

85
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,010
The world's greatest corporation
conducting illicit business at a diner.

86
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,770
I thought you'd find
the familiarity reassuring.

87
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,270
I won't pick hairs.
I'm here for your answer.

88
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:07,400
The cyberskeleton project is
a delicate topic even within Arasaka.

89
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,780
It turned problematic when Tanaka
over-consolidated the operational data.

90
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,410
How much does Militech already know?

91
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,320
Information is the blood of my trade.

92
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,910
I'll need some assurances
before I say any more.

93
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:23,330
We respect that
you're the best man for the job.

94
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,840
We'll gladly provide the compensation
Militech foolishly denied you.

95
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,920
As for the Tanaka mess,
consider your debt settled.

96
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,170
Wonderful.

97
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,550
However, we have some conditions as well.

98
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,430
Let's hear it.

99
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:42,810
We need to eliminate anyone
who knows about the cyberskeleton.

100
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,480
Done.

101
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,230
And one more thing.

102
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,480
Yes?

103
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,110
After Tanaka died,

104
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:54,610
there's been a runner interfering
with our recovery on the corrupt data.

105
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,070
Know anything about it?

106
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,030
Not that I can recall.

107
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,950
I see.

108
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,910
We're quite curious about this case.

109
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,710
Even if this were Militech,
I can't even imagine why they'd do this.

110
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,630
From what my sources tell me,

111
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:15,130
no one else knows about Tanaka's ties
to the cyberskeleton project.

112
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,090
An inside job?

113
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:21,680
No. It's impossible to move internally
without leaving a trail.

114
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,350
It's more natural to think that
it's a skilled runner from the outside.

115
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,310
Seems to me like a job for a fixer.

116
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,860
Is this an official commission?

117
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,360
One million to take them alive.
Half the price for their head.

118
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,410
I accept.

119
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,220
Take that!

120
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,180
Out of juice!

121
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,720
Gotcha.

122
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,160
What are you doing?!

123
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,080
Ah… My bad.

124
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,040
Later, David.

125
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,130
Yeah…

126
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,170
Falco! Lemme off too!

127
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,300
What?

128
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,010
Well dang,
guess the after-party's just us two.

129
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,020
I've got somewhere to be, too.

130
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,440
That so? Bunch of killjoys,
you, one and all.

131
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:16,980
David!

132
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,900
No after-party today?

133
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,610
Can't get drunk with those two boomers.

134
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,990
Can't promise I'll be any more fun.

135
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,830
Don't underestimate yourself!

136
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,490
Hey… Wanna take a walk?

137
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,290
Huh? Sure, I guess…

138
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,580
Yes!

139
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,130
So… you doing okay?

140
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,210
What?

141
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,720
What was that today?

142
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,430
What was what?

143
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,760
You know what I mean.

144
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,680
It was nothing.

145
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,810
This isn't the first time it's happened.

146
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,480
You thought I didn't notice?

147
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,600
Whatever.

148
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,730
A girl's intuition, you know?

149
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,820
What girl?

150
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,280
Shut up.

151
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,280
You're the only one I watch
that closely, you know.

152
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,490
Come on, David. What's wrong?

153
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,830
Nothing.

154
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,330
I said cut the bull.

155
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,120
It's got nothing to do with you.

156
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:21,380
Like hell it doesn't.
I'm putting my life in your hands.

157
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,090
Sorry.

158
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,010
I was thinking…

159
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,430
Yeah?

160
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,390
You should lay off
the implants for a while.

161
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,140
Don't worry. I've got your back!

162
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:36,770
You?

163
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,520
I'm being serious.

164
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,190
Remember the psycho
that flatlined my brother?

165
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,240
Yeah.

166
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,410
I don't… wanna see you end up like that.

167
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,950
Yeah.

168
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,820
They're still sending runners?

169
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,600
Hm?

170
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,110
Who are you? W-What the…

171
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,390
Wait…

172
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,600
David!

173
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,570
Rise and shine.

174
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,190
Doc…

175
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,530
Symptoms settling down?

176
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,650
Yeah…

177
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,330
When did it start?

178
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,490
What?

179
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,500
Shaky hands, dizziness,
nausea, usual suspects.

180
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,000
A little while ago.

181
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,290
Why didn't you tell me?

182
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,170
Thought it was temporary.

183
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,300
Looks like side-effects
are finally catching up with you.

184
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,430
Of course, it's crazy enough
how you've been fine until now.

185
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,060
Why now?

186
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,850
Lay off the chrome for a while.

187
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,400
You're already one foot
in the psycho zone.

188
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,070
Then gimme stronger meds for it!

189
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:16,110
Shit. You ain't hearing me.
Or have you already lost your mind?

190
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,950
Ain't no such miracle drug in exist…

191
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:26,460
Think I came for jokes?
Take my fucking money…

192
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,880
and gimme the fucking meds!

193
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,340
David!

194
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:45,100
There. Your last prescription. Nine times
standard dosage, good for nine days.

195
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:49,730
It'll send you straight over the edge
and right to hell.

196
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,480
I'm sorry. I won't let it happen again.

197
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,690
It's fine.

198
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,870
The fact that you need those meds means
you won't be coming back here anymore.

199
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,870
A kid off the block pushing XBDs and now…

200
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:10,540
Go be a legend or
whatever the fuck you punks do.

201
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,890
Just another tale for the next dreamer…

202
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,310
David! Wait! What was that?

203
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,310
Don't tell the guys.

204
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,310
I don't understand.

205
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,230
Hey!

206
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,200
Your body, your mind…
They have limits, David. You knew that.

207
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,580
Normal meds don't do it for you anymore.

208
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,040
Isn't it time to call quits?

209
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,960
I can't watch you do this to yourself.
Scale back your cyberware…

210
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,090
I can't do that.

211
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,050
Why not?

212
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:02,300
Mom and Maine…
They all left me something to do.

213
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,310
But I haven't done nothing yet.

214
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,770
But you can't keep going on like this…

215
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,980
I'll be fine.

216
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:15,520
How could you say that?
Do you really think you're special?

217
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:21,110
I withstood the Sandevistan.
I'm not normal.

218
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:28,330
So you're a little more sturdy than
everyone else. But you're still human.

219
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,830
I shot a woman.

220
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,750
Huh?

221
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,130
She was around the same age as my mom.

222
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,630
She also had a son like me.

223
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,600
A harmless bystander. A normal person.

224
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,100
I don't know how many I've killed anymore.

225
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,100
It doesn't even make me pause anymore.

226
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,980
Maybe I really am going crazy.

227
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,530
David…

228
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,200
I ain't normal.
Like you said before, I'm different.

229
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,620
You're not.

230
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,990
I am!

231
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,330
You're not.

232
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,120
You wouldn't understand.

233
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,000
You left the crew after Maine died.

234
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,500
That's because…

235
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,260
I'm not blaming you.

236
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,510
Why not?

237
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,380
You shouldn't have to live this life.

238
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,890
No, David. That's not what I…

239
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,810
Then you'll come back?

240
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:34,310
Let's go back to the way things were,
working together.

241
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,650
I can't right now.
Wait for me a little while longer.

242
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,570
What for?

243
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,280
There's something I need to do first.

244
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,120
Like what?

245
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,790
I can't say.

246
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,500
Why?

247
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,540
Sorry.

248
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,000
Because you don't trust me.

249
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm sorry.

250
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,170
Okay. I'll stop asking you about it.

251
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,090
Okay.

252
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,430
Maybe we should go our separate ways.

253
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,600
No! That's not true David.

254
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,860
I'm sorry, David. I have to go.

255
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,360
Huh? Where?

256
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,200
I have to go…

257
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,740
Okay.

258
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,370
We'll talk when I get home.

259
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,910
Wait for me.

260
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,760
The same ID as the runner from before.

261
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,310
There you are…

262
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,340
Didn't think it would be so easy.

263
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,930
This is our passport into Arasaka.

264
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,300
Excellent job, Kiwi.
