1
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,940
Wanna try 'em on?

2
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,190
I can't afford it.

3
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,190
Becca gave the nod. All yours, no strings.

4
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,490
No thanks.

5
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,950
Didn't bother you
when you put that klepped Sandy on.

6
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,120
Can't scavenge off someone you knew?

7
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,040
They're techie mitts anyways.

8
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,120
You're just being picky.

9
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,500
I have my sights set on something else.

10
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,880
Wha'tcha got your eyes on?

11
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,380
Oh! This?

12
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,840
Bit big for you, ain't it?

13
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,630
I can handle it.

14
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,720
Sure, all yours if I flatline.

15
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,270
Gives you time to bulk up, grow into 'em.

16
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,640
'Kay. Deal.

17
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,730
Ya know, something's different about you…

18
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,650
Huh?

19
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,780
You're usually moping,
bringing the vibe down…

20
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,400
Resident buzzkill.

21
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,450
I'm not!
And I ain't no different from yesterday!

22
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,910
Nah. Something's off.

23
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,120
Ya get laid?

24
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,710
You did.

25
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,670
Gotta work on that poker face, son!

26
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,420
Kiwi! Any progress?

27
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,760
Not at all.

28
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,180
Tanaka's beefed up his defenses
since the last gig.

29
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,850
Tried poking holes around,
but it's been a no-go.

30
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,190
What did I tell ya? We ain't getting
nowhere unless Faraday feeds us something.

31
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,150
Tanaka?

32
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,940
Remember your very first grand theft auto?

33
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,440
He's the owner of the limo.

34
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,190
Problem?

35
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,990
Nah, it's nothing…

36
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,450
Would you look at that.

37
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,950
You were schoolmates with Tanaka's kid.

38
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,670
What?! You accusing our kid of
going to some stuffy corpo school?!

39
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,710
Bona-fide Arasaka Academy dropout.
Straight A student, too.

40
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,710
I'll be damned!

41
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Guess we now know why Gloria was
always strapped on cash.

42
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,470
What's a guy gotta do
to get some privacy around here?

43
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:53,190
There's not much else I could find on
Tanaka's private file. The rest is trash.

44
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,980
-Like?
-XBDs in his viewing log.

45
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,530
That's good. We can use it for leverage.

46
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,740
A real kinkster. More gore than porn.

47
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,070
Some cyberpsycho shit, too.

48
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,990
The deep, dark fetishes of a suit.

49
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,000
Lots of vids from a gonk who goes by JK.

50
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,910
JK?

51
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,620
Heard of him?

52
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:19,380
Sure. Jimmy Kurosaki. The braindance
director with a cult following.

53
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:24,760
He's known for putting up snuff reels
within 24 hours of it happening.

54
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,140
Never seen any director
do the edits that he does.

55
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,020
No wonder he's got so many fans.

56
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,060
Didn't know you were a superfreak.

57
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,020
Uh, well…

58
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,650
Just helped a choom
move his stock, is all.

59
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:44,320
That's good and all, but do you have
any intel we can actually use?

60
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,610
They're custom-made.

61
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,530
What?

62
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,080
I heard that he sometimes tunes
custom-made footage for VIPs.

63
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,120
You know, like removing pain limiters?

64
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,540
So what?

65
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,880
If he's tuning the footage,
Tanaka's gotta be there as well.

66
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,170
And probably alone.

67
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,050
Alone? How you figure?

68
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,550
Would you bring a bodyguard
to tune up a fetish BD?

69
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,930
Kid's got a point.

70
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,180
Getting sharp, kid!

71
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,350
Now that you're a man now!

72
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,440
What? Did something happen?

73
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,690
Nothing!

74
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,440
Faraday came through
with a lead on Tanaka.

75
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,820
Seems our favorite suit
occasionally ditches his huscle

76
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,070
and usual ride for a Delamain.

77
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,990
Going off-radar, huh?

78
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,790
But Delamain's got him fully covered.
Still can't pinpoint his destination.

79
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,710
I also looked into
the tuning services for BDs.

80
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:42,300
The main buyers are fat cats,
corpo execs, celebrities, gang bosses…

81
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,050
You get in by referral
and the location is undisclosed.

82
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,260
If we wanna know more,
we'd have to chat with the man himself.

83
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,640
How?

84
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,350
Gotta grab him in person.

85
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:57,440
Lucky for us, he has a reservation at
Embers tomorrow. He'll be alone.

86
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,350
At a ritzy place like that? Sad.

87
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,860
Great. When he leaves,
let's invite him here for a nightcap.

88
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,280
Let's go.

89
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,520
Hey! You wouldn't happen to be
Jimmy Kurosaki, would you?

90
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,940
Who's asking?

91
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,440
I knew it! I'm a huge fan, sir!

92
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,900
You know a ripperdoc
in Arroyo who pushes XBDs?

93
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,280
I helped him sell your stuff!

94
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,280
Really.

95
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,660
Can I shake your hand?

96
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,660
Oh, sorry… Guess I'm a bit star-struck.

97
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,540
Yeah, I got places to be.

98
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,040
Right… I won't hold you up.

99
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,000
Was an honor meeting you…

100
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,310
What was that?!

101
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,190
Fuck!

102
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,230
What?!

103
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,730
Maine!

104
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,440
Where's David?

105
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,990
Find him!

106
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,610
Snap out of it!

107
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,160
You alright?

108
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,250
Son of a bitch pulled something on us.

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,500
What happened?

110
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,330
They're gone.

111
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,250
Gone?

112
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,000
He nabbed David.

113
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,800
Kiwi! You take Maine and head out.

114
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,010
Okay.

115
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,720
I'm fine…

116
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,760
Be a good boy, and stay!

117
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,020
Lucy! You're with me.

118
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,320
Got him. Mile and change, straight ahead.

119
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,990
What did that asshole use back there?

120
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,910
Seemed like some kind of EMP.

121
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:20,830
It got Kiwi real bad.
Only gave me a bit of a shock.

122
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:26,080
Neural implant targeting.
To neutralize runners, clearly.

123
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,630
You seem okay.

124
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,710
I wasn't in range.

125
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,460
David could be in real shit.

126
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,840
It'll be a problem if he uses that again.

127
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,220
Not if we kill him first.

128
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,220
You're pissed, aren't ya?

129
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,270
A little.

130
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,500
Ah, fuck.

131
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,710
Think it's a cyberpsycho?

132
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,340
No shit, let's head out.
Already hailed MaxTac.

133
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,510
Hey, there's another body.

134
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,020
Don't wander off, man.
What if you run into them?

135
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,060
Don't worry. They're not around anymore.

136
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,520
Hm? Who's there?!

137
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,860
The cyberpsycho!

138
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,030
He's got a gun!

139
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,610
-It wasn't me…
-Drop the gun!

140
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,820
Don't move!

141
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,780
-I woke up and I was just…
-Drop it, you fucking psycho!

142
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,910
Who's there?!

143
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,410
Hey! What happened?!

144
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,590
Got a cyberpsycho!

145
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,630
Raise MaxTac now!

146
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,990
Shots fired back there!

147
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,450
Die, bastard!

148
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,190
MaxTac?!

149
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,720
Fucking monster.

150
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,970
No! It wasn't me!

151
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,070
Awesome, isn't it?

152
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,820
Experiencing your own death
instead of someone else's.

153
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,330
Are you fucking kidding me?!

154
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,750
Awesome? You fucking psychopath…

155
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,710
Hey, I thought you were a fan!

156
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,090
Most of my fans are whack jobs.

157
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,340
You're a cyberpunk, aren't you?

158
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,180
What are you after?

159
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,720
Ambushing me in a place like that…

160
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,600
Clearly, you've done your homework.
Have you seen any of my other works?

161
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,230
The Edgerunner series?

162
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,100
Yeah.

163
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,610
I've seen most of your stuff.

164
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,610
Wow. I'm flattered!

165
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:29,490
Say, have you ever wondered
where I get those cyberpsycho scrolls?

166
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,790
What?

167
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:36,750
All military prototypes come with
a built-in braindance scroller.

168
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:42,010
Some people are willing to
pay through the nose for that kinda stuff.

169
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,260
You know who originally owned this Sandy?

170
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,180
James Norris. How many people
did he kill in the end? 27?

171
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,770
Had a hell of a run-in
with MaxTac in the end.

172
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,900
It's not often you get a guy
who can go toe-to-toe with them.

173
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,620
That was so good…
One of the best I've seen in a while.

174
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,620
I've got high expectations for you, too.

175
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,750
I'm surprised you're still sane
after wearing this.

176
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,380
The side-effects are gonna
drive you mad, eventually.

177
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,840
Can't wait to see it.

178
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,380
I'm not gonna go psycho!

179
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,640
That's what all chromers say.

180
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,890
They think they're all sane
until they aren't.

181
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,890
Not me!

182
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,390
Yes, you.

183
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:42,150
Another couple rounds with the MaxTac
and your brain'll burst like a balloon.

184
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,740
Wait. You're not gonna
make me go through that again…

185
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,780
Hey, stop!

186
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,910
Cut it out!

187
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,910
Stop!

188
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,460
Don't move!

189
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,460
Put your hands up…

190
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,220
Or you're dead.

191
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,470
You got me!

192
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,220
How's David?

193
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,020
He's in a BD or something.

194
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,980
-Can you get him out?
-I'll try.

195
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,650
Need a hand?

196
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,730
Shut it!

197
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,070
Got it!

198
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,450
David! You alright?

199
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,530
Aw, what a shame.

200
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,990
So? What do you guys want?

201
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,620
I assume you're not here to kill me.

202
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,370
That's still up for jury.

203
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,130
Come on. I'll cooperate.

204
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,750
You catch on quick.

205
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,010
That better not be…

206
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,640
Armed drones!

207
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,640
Bingo!

208
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,430
Call them off!

209
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,230
No can do.

210
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,650
Go on, give 'em a wave.
They're my best toys. Bulletproof and all.

211
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,400
Good luck putting them down
with those tiny little bangers.

212
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,450
I'll blow your brains out first!

213
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,280
Well, that wouldn't be very smart.

214
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,540
That won't stop them from turning you
into a bloodstain on my floor.

215
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,660
Yeah? They won't shoot as long as
I'm using you as a meat-shield.

216
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,500
Knew it was smart to have two.

217
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,550
Shit!

218
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,220
Oh no! Looks like you're surrounded.

219
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,840
Ready to give up?

220
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,140
Shut up!

221
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,050
Lucy!

222
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,800
On it…

223
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,680
I need more time…

224
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:46,610
David!

225
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,190
I'll distract them!

226
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,320
Hurry it up, Lucy!

227
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,190
Wow! That was impressive!

228
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,900
-Mother…
-Fucker!

229
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:31,030
White flag! White flag!
Okay, I surrender for real this time!

230
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,820
White flag my ass!

231
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,410
You're already dead, shit stain!

232
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,410
I mean, alright, but I thought
you wanted to ask me things?

233
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,660
God dammit!

234
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:45,330
Hey girl! Takes real talent
to pull off a hack so quickly.

235
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,920
I'll listen to what you have to say,
but can I get up, please?

236
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,760
No funny business or I'll kill you myself.

237
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,880
I won't. Pinky swear.

238
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,180
Alright. Everyone got the plan?

239
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,600
Aye aye, captain.

240
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,690
I'll call you later.
Until then, stay here.

241
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:08,480
Keep an eye on him.
Don't let him out of your sight.

242
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,200
Sorry about earlier.

243
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,700
Whatever.

244
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,040
Didn't think you'd agree
to help us so easily.

245
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:29,420
I know how cyberpunks work.
I don't really have a choice, do I?

246
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,960
Well, yeah.

247
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,050
You've seen that one too?

248
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:34,970
Yeah.

249
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,930
You saw it
and you still installed the Sandy?

250
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,720
You're one crazy dude.

251
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,470
I won't end up like him.

252
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,350
James Norris was a soldier
who knew his way around implants.

253
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,060
But even he couldn't take it
and went psycho.

254
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,440
What makes you think you're different?

255
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,700
I don't know. It just… feels right.

256
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,820
It's like the implant's
always been a part of me.

257
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,950
I think… I'm built different.

258
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,790
You think you're special?

259
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:07,710
Sure.

260
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,420
I've seen plenty of chromejocks
go psycho over the years.

261
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,630
Some metal's simply not meant to
mix with meat.

262
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,720
Your organic body, your soul, gets pushed
to the edge. Teeters on the brink.

263
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,730
It always comes down to one of two things.

264
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,230
You either lose your mind…

265
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,980
Or die… No in-between.

266
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,240
We will be arriving
at the destination shortly.

267
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,710
As requested, the record of
your ride today has been expunged.

268
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,960
I look forward to serving you again.

269
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:57,460
Hey, Mister Tanaka. Come on in.

270
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,430
You're early.

271
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,260
It usually takes months for a new release.

272
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:08,770
Well, it's difficult finding
good material, you see.

273
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,230
But this next one'll be worth your while.

274
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,270
Would you like to have it
tuned immediately?

275
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,280
My son is being discharged
from the hospital tonight.

276
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,740
I will just be taking the chip.

277
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,030
I see.

278
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,660
That's unfortunate. I'm proud of
how this one turned out.

279
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,790
It'd be a huge waste not to have it tuned.

280
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,040
The sensitivity'd be off the charts.

281
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,540
Mister Kurosaki.

282
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,500
I do not humor slow men.

283
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,300
Unfortunate's one word for it.

284
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,800
Would've made our job a lot easier
if you were in that BD.

285
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,390
Who are you?

286
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,850
Don't try nothing.

287
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,060
The nerve…

288
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,310
Super sorry, sir.
They have me by the balls.

289
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,520
Do you have any idea
who you're dealing with?

290
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,070
Forget about the panic button.
We've got a jammer up.

291
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,830
Just as planned, I see.

292
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,670
Not fucking now!

293
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:26,930
Maine!

294
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,350
You're…

295
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,820
Pain in my ass.

296
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,080
Must've been the needles.

297
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,330
Got him in the neck.

298
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,870
Shit, he really was slow.

299
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,870
He's suffocating.

300
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,620
Ah… Sucks for him.

301
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,880
Looks like he won't be around
to edit his own death scroll.

302
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,140
Flatlined.

303
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,390
Shit. Trauma Team's coming.

304
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:15,020
What? This bitch had Trauma coverage?

305
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,770
Yup. Platinum and everything.

306
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:18,900
Fuck.

307
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,650
Kid, we're getting the hell out!

308
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,400
Now. They find us and we're fucked.
