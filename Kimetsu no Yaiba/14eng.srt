1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:01,980
Take this!

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,480
Move it!

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:04,600
Take this!

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,810
Draw your sword and fight me!

5
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,070
You spineless punk!

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,410
Enough!

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,830
I'll just have to skewer you
along with that box!

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:25,830
Knock it off!

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,300
Knock it off!

10
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,980
EPISODE 14:
THE HOUSE WITH
THE WISTERIA FAMILY CREST

11
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,110
Knock it off!

12
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,540
He broke his bones!

13
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,290
Aren't you a member
of the Demon Slayers Corps?

14
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,920
Don't you get why Zenitsu refuses
to draw his sword?

15
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,090
It's because it's taboo for us to draw
our swords on each other for no reason!

16
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,800
But here you are,
giving him a one-sided beatdown!

17
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,340
Is that fun for you?

18
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,810
You're the lowest of the low!

19
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,940
Oh, so that's why?

20
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,820
My bad.

21
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,200
In that case, let's fight barehanded.

22
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,950
No! I don't think you get it at all!

23
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,990
First...

24
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,830
We're not supposed to fight
each other, period!

25
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,040
Fighting barehanded doesn't make it all right!

26
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,960
Listen to me!

27
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,020
<i>Look at him!
How can he move like that?</i>

28
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,770
<i>I mean, Tanjiro just busted
some of his ribs.</i>

29
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,540
Actually, isn't Tanjiro
running afoul of the taboo himself?

30
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,000
He did break his bones.

31
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,190
<i>Th-This guy...</i>

32
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,990
<i>His attacks are bizarrely low!</i>

33
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,740
<i>It's just like...</i>

34
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,950
<i>Just like...</i>

35
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,660
<i>battling a four-legged beast!</i>

36
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,870
<i>Target him low!</i>

37
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,040
<i>Even lower than your opponent!</i>

38
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,260
<i>The flexibility of his joints!</i>

39
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,720
<i>It's superhuman!</i>

40
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,430
Pretty amazing, aren't I?

41
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,100
Pretty amazing, aren't I?

42
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,230
<i>He said it twice!</i>

43
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,850
<i>Singing his own praises...</i>

44
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,770
And look what else I can do!

45
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,530
Cut it out! Don't do stuff like that!

46
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,780
Knock it off when you've got busted bones!

47
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,450
It's gonna get worse!

48
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,620
Worse? Fine by me!

49
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,840
Nothing can top
the pleasure of this moment!

50
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,800
You need to think hard about the future!

51
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,670
What do I care?

52
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,430
You need to...

53
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,930
calm down!

54
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,020
That sound!
Are your skulls fractured?

55
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:54,450
Huh? A girl? Huh? Your face!

56
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,460
What the hell?

57
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,460
You've got a problem
with my face or something?

58
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,800
You're one creepy guy, you know that?

59
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,140
You've got such a ripped body,
but there's a girl's face sitting on top of it.

60
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,970
Why the hell are you staring
at my face like that?

61
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,640
I-I'm not!

62
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,980
I'm not looking at your face!

63
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,650
We don't have a problem with your face!

64
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,360
It's quite petite, fair-skinned,
and therefore attractive!

65
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,110
You're a corpse! Come at me!

66
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,660
Not happening!
I'm not gonna attack you anymore!

67
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,530
Try head-butting me one more time!

68
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,870
Nope, I'm done!

69
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,540
I said do it! Come on!

70
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,420
You sit yourself down! Are you okay?

71
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,250
Hey, Big Forehead!

72
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,420
Let me tell you my name.

73
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,670
It's Inosuke Hashibira!

74
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,260
Don't you forget it!

75
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,880
What characters do you use to spell that?

76
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,840
Spell? Spell...

77
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,720
I don't know how to read or write!

78
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,890
That name is written on my loinclothâ€”

79
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,640
What's wrong?

80
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,480
He froze.

81
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,780
What's the matter?

82
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,790
He collapsed!

83
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,080
Is he dead?

84
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,790
He's not dead.

85
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,000
It's probably a concussion.

86
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,340
Because I head-butted the hell out of him.

87
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,640
Are you okay, Tanjiro?

88
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:33,890
Yeah.

89
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,810
Amazing! Can I touch your head?

90
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:37,850
Here!

91
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,180
<i>That's scary!</i>

92
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,900
<i>Not a drop of blood from Tanjiro's head.</i>

93
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,020
<i>How hard is it anyway?</i>

94
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,190
<i>I mean, the wild boar's passed out.</i>

95
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,450
Tanjiro, your head is so hard!

96
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,740
You think so?

97
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:58,950
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

98
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,960
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

99
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,730
He's awake!

100
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,270
Fight me! Fight me!

101
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,150
Hey, you!

102
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,360
This is how he is when he wakes up?

103
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,730
I hate that more than anything!

104
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,580
What the hell are you guys doing?

105
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,580
It's a burial.

106
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,590
You help out, too, Inosuke.

107
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,300
There are still people
who were killed inside the house.

108
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,380
What's the point of burying
the corpses of creatures?

109
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,760
I'm not doing that! I'm not helping out!

110
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,510
Forget that! Fight me!

111
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,810
<i>Man, he really is a loon.</i>

112
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,150
<i>What does he mean, what's the point?</i>

113
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,770
I see.

114
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,150
You can't do it because
your wounds are hurting you.

115
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,200
<i>Those two are beyond help!</i>

116
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,120
<i>They're both crazy!</i>

117
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,120
No, that's okay.

118
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,660
After all, we all have
a different pain threshold.

119
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,540
Moving everyone who died
outside that house,

120
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,170
then burying them by covering them
with dirt is a lot of work.

121
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,970
Zenitsu and these kids and I
will do our best, so don't worry!

122
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,050
<i>He's so off.</i>

123
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,050
<i>He's so off.</i>

124
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,310
You should get some rest, Inosuke.

125
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,190
Sorry to ask too much of you!

126
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,060
Don't underestimate me, dammit!

127
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,190
I'll bury a hundred,
no, two hundred of your corpses!

128
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,200
Just watch! I'm going to bury
more than anyone of you!

129
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What is that person doing?

130
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,500
Better not look.

131
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,460
Yeah.

132
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,720
Descend the mountain!

133
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,020
Descend the mountain!

134
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,390
That crow is talking!

135
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,730
Just don't think anymore.

136
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,020
Okay.

137
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,320
All right, follow me!

138
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,320
Follow yours truly!

139
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,990
Hey!

140
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,410
Where are you going?

141
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,540
We're descending the mountain.

142
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,830
We're not done with our battle yet!

143
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,460
You're tired, aren't you?

144
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,250
Come on, we're heading down.

145
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,210
I'm not tired!

146
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,220
Let's fight!

147
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,930
I won't have it!

148
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,680
I won't have it! I won't have it!

149
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,850
You can't go, Shoichi!

150
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,560
You're powerful, Shoichi!

151
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,230
Shoichi is the one
who's gonna protect me!

152
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,700
Can't you see Shoichi doesn't want to stay?

153
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,870
Please don't leave me behind!

154
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,740
You stop that right now!

155
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,120
Hold out your hands!

156
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,840
That will ward off demons.

157
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,800
You with marechi,
keep that on your person!

158
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,050
It smells like wisteria.

159
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,680
Wisteria?

160
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,760
It's a flower that demons can't abide.

161
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,310
You should hold onto that.

162
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,980
Demon repellent!

163
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,560
Demon repellent!

164
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,570
We're truly grateful!

165
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,240
We can get home on our own.

166
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,110
Take care, now!

167
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,240
Now then, follow me!

168
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,580
Follow yours truly!

169
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,500
Fight me!

170
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,010
I swear I'm gonna find a weak point
and bring you down, loser!

171
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,630
My name's not "loser"!

172
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,680
It's Tanjiro Kamado!

173
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,930
Gonpachiro Kamaboko!

174
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,850
I'm gonna bring you down!

175
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,470
Who the hell are you talking about?

176
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,350
- That would be you!
- No, it's someone else!

177
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,810
Can you talk any louder?

178
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,860
WISTERIA

179
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,320
A wisteria family crest...

180
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,830
Rest time! Rest time!

181
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,960
Since you've sustained injuries,
you're to rest until you're fully recovered!

182
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,630
You sure it's okay to rest?

183
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,630
I just fought a demon
while injured, you know.

184
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,510
Ke-ke-ke.

185
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,720
"Ke-ke-ke"?

186
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,390
Let's eat this thing.

187
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,310
What?

188
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,730
Yes?

189
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,150
Sorry to bother you so late at night!

190
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,190
A monster!

191
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,400
It's a monster!

192
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,360
Hey you!

193
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,110
Who the hell are you?

194
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,110
I see you're a demon hunter.

195
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,160
You look pretty weak!

196
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,410
Hey!

197
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,870
Come in.

198
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,420
That old lady sure walks fast!

199
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,760
This is where you'll be staying.

200
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,260
A change of clothes.

201
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,850
And here is your meal.

202
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,310
She has to be a monster, Tanjiro!
That old lady's a monster!

203
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,900
She's so quick, it's eerie!
She's a monster!

204
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,270
A monster hagâ€”

205
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,240
Use your chopsticks.

206
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:25,880
If you're that hungry,
you can have this, too.

207
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,430
Here.

208
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,180
No!

209
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,140
<i>He's totally forgotten about the box!</i>

210
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,440
<i>Gimme a break, you thug!
Moron! Eyelashes!</i>

211
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,190
Your bedding.

212
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,320
There she is! The monster hagâ€”

213
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,450
First come, first served!

214
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,370
I'm taking this one!

215
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,660
That's fine. Sleep wherever you want.

216
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,920
Where do you want to sleep, Zenitsu?

217
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,460
Here is the doctor.

218
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,800
Hello.

219
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,260
Yes.

220
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,600
Severe!

221
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,900
Who would've guessed
that all three of us had broken ribs?

222
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,190
2 RIBS                3 RIBS                   4 RIBS

223
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,200
This knot hurts more than my ribs.

224
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,530
Sorry.

225
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,040
Hey, you'd better apologize.

226
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,540
It really hurt, you know.

227
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,160
Getting pounded to a pulp like that.

228
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,710
Say you're sorry.

229
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,960
I'll pass.

230
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,340
Say you're sorry!

231
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,170
I'll pass!

232
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,460
Just say you're sorry!

233
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,050
If you're gonna be like that,
we're not eating with you anymore.

234
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,550
What's up with that?

235
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,060
Meals always taste better
when you eat together, you know.

236
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,390
He's right about that.

237
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,850
Did you guys hurt
your heads or something?

238
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,810
Who are you to talk?

239
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,400
Is there something I can help you with?

240
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,530
Monster!

241
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,730
Hey!

242
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:29,260
WISTERIA

243
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,030
According to the crow,

244
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:17,490
this house with the wisteria
family crest belongs to a family

245
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,500
that was once rescued
by demon hunters.

246
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:24,460
That's why they take care of people
for free if they're demon hunters.

247
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,290
That's what I was told,

248
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,260
but I never thought
they'd show us this much hospitality.

249
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,010
Just how great is the Demon Slayers Corps?

250
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,850
Now that you mention it, Inosuke,
why did you join the Corps?

251
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,020
You had some kind of reason, didn't you?

252
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:45,440
A member of the Demon Slayers Corps
barged in on me on my mountain,

253
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:49,070
so we competed to see
who was stronger, and I seized his sword.

254
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,070
<i>What an unfortunate soul.</i>

255
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,240
And then, I heard there was something
called "Final Selection,"

256
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,080
and the fact that demons do exist.

257
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,080
So that's why you joined
the Demon Slayers Corps?

258
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,210
And hey, so you and I both
grew up in the mountains, huh?

259
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,460
Don't lump me in with you!

260
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,470
I don't have any parents or siblings!

261
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:19,720
Testing my strength against other
living creatures is my only pleasure!

262
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,310
Is that right?

263
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,230
Is that right?

264
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:34,950
Tanjiro, no one else is asking,
so I'm gonna ask myself.

265
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,490
Why are you traveling with a demon?

266
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,880
Zenitsu...

267
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,800
You knew about that
and still protected the box, huh?

268
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,970
You really are a great guy,
you know that?

269
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,590
Thanks!

270
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,680
You...

271
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,770
You really shouldn't heap
so much praise on me!

272
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,350
I've got a keen sense of smell.

273
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,480
I knew it from the start.

274
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,020
How kind you are, Zenitsu...

275
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,070
and how strong...

276
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,200
No, I'm not strong.

277
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,360
Don't give me that.

278
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:21,580
I haven't forgiven you for stopping me
from bringing Shoichi along.

279
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,790
It's trying to come out!
It's trying to come out!

280
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,790
It's all right.

281
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,630
How can it be all right? Huh? Huh?

282
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,380
Shush!

283
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,680
It's the middle of the night, Zenitsu!

284
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,640
<i>Why won't he take the bait?</i>

285
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,510
<i>Even when I stole his food...</i>

286
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:48,690
<i>Come to think of it,
why did he get mad a couple of times?</i>

287
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,730
<i>I forgot.</i>

288
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,200
Oh my gosh! It's not even locked?

289
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,700
P-P-Protect me!
Someone please protect me!

290
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,490
Even you'll do, Inosuke!

291
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,700
Stay away from me!

292
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,970
It's out!

293
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,720
I gotta hide! I'm so scared!

294
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,810
Nezuko!

295
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,580
That's too much thinking.

296
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,630
Zenitsu...

297
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,960
Nezuko's myâ€”

298
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,840
Tanjiro...

299
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,090
Listen to me.

300
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,510
Z-Zenitsu?

301
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,100
Listen to me.

302
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,110
Just who do you think you are?

303
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,900
So, you've been traveling
with a girl this cute?

304
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,740
With a girl this cute in tow,
day after day, you've been traveling,

305
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,830
and you've been on cloud nine
the whole time, huh?

306
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,250
Zenitsu, it's not likeâ€”

307
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,330
Give me back all the blood I shed!

308
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,250
I... Listen, I...

309
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:39,420
I didn't give it my all just so you could spend
time in la-la land, making out with a girl!

310
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,090
That's not why I got pummeled and kicked
by that weird wild boar, right?

311
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,470
Zenitsu, calm down!
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

312
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,640
Demon Slayer Corps
is not something you'd join for fun!

313
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:56,480
Guys like you gotta be purged! Immediately!

314
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,610
Come to think of it, there's also the crime
of thwarting my marriage

315
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,490
and sending Shoichi home.

316
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,740
Purged immediately!

317
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:09,990
Don't ever underestimate the Corps!

318
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,080
A guy like you! A guy like you!

319
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,170
Zenitsu, cut it out!

320
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,090
Mock the Demon Slayers Corps...

321
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:24,180
and you'll get sent to Hell!

322
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,640
You shall feel my wrath!

323
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,230
Combined Junior and Senior High School!

SELF-INTRODUCTIONS

327
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,030
The new semester's begun.

328
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,160
Announce your names.

329
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,950
Yes, sir!

330
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,240
I'm Tanjiro Kamado!

331
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,790
My family runs a bakery,
and I'm the eldest of six children!

332
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,540
NO PIERCINGS

333
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,120
Take off those pierced earrings.

334
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,500
I'm Inosuke Hashibira!

335
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,250
NO DRESSING DOWN

336
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,670
Button your shirt.

337
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,000
Um, I'm Zenitsuâ€”

338
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,460
NO HAIR COLORING

339
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,090
Dye your hair black.

340
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,460
But this is my natural color.

341
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,920
Don't talk back!

342
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,130
So unfair!

343
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,510
It's also forbidden
to hold bread in your mouth!

344
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,260
NEXT EPISODE:
MOUNT NATAGUMO
