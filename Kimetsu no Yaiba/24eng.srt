1
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,230
Are you heading into battle?

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,440
Is that you, Kocho?

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,910
We just got some new information
about a demon,

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,740
and the Slayers who confronted him
got taken out.

5
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,540
We're losing rank and filers, too, now.
We can't stand by and do nothing!

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,250
Could it be the Twelve Kizuki?

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,380
Most likely, yes. It might be
a member of the Upper Ranks.

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,880
It sounds like a difficult mission,

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,880
but as long as you're going, Rengoku,
there's nothing to worry about.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,510
Kocho, what's your plan
taking in that head-butting kid?

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,020
You said you were going to add
more Tsuguko,

12
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,140
but I'm sure that's not the reason.

13
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,650
Don't worry, it's not as if
I'll gobble him up, all right?

14
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,060
Well, of course you wouldn't!

15
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,320
Be careful.

16
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,000
EPISODE 24:
REHABILITATION TRAINING

17
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,000
Nooooo!

18
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,510
I can't possibly take any more!

19
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,630
We go through this every single day!

20
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,340
You're the most severely injured, Zenitsu!

21
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,510
Take your medicine this second!

22
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,600
Seriously!

23
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,150
Tanjiro, your medicine is right over there.

24
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Here you go.

25
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,770
Thanks.

26
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,530
Hey!

27
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,410
Tanjiro's medicine goes down easy,
doesn't it? Right?

28
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,910
It's different than mine, isn't it?

29
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,910
I call favoritism! I call favoritism!

30
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,410
Zenitsu, this is a hospital ward!
Pipe down!

31
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,670
You seem to be doing well!

32
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,420
DESTROY

33
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,130
Murata!

34
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,670
Hey!

35
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,800
Are you all right?

36
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:25,100
Well, I came this close to getting
melted away, but I made it somehow.

37
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,810
But I hear you guys got really banged up.

38
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,430
It looks like it's going to take some time.

39
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,560
And Wild Boar Kid,
in your case, was it the throat?

40
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,730
What's the matter with him?

41
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,820
He went through a lot.
If you could please let him be...

42
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,240
But for this guy of all people
to be so listlessâ€”

43
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,450
Tanjiro!

44
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,240
Who is that person?

45
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,750
He's Murata. He fought
with us on Mt. Natagumo.

46
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,710
I'm Murata! Nice to meet you!

47
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,000
Hey, your arm...

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,260
I almost got turned into a spider,
and my arms and legs are still short...

49
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,170
And that's why you need this medicine!

50
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,340
But it tastes so gross!

51
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,720
There's only so much gross
a person can take!

52
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,600
Don't come crying to me
if your arms don't go back to normal!

53
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,180
So cold! That's such a cold thing to say!

54
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,100
You don't know how good you have it!

55
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:19,150
I mean, if you take this medicine and get
lots of sunlight, there'll be no lasting effects!

56
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,400
I can't do it!

57
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,740
Gross is gross! No two ways about it!

58
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
Looks like fun. Lucky you.

59
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,490
Murata?

60
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:35,170
I was summoned to the Hashira Meeting
to give my report on the Mt. Natagumo incident.

61
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,250
And it was like hell!
Those Hashira are way too terrifying!

62
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,800
All pissed about how the quality
of the newer Slayers has gone downhill...

63
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,220
Because there were some of us
who didn't follow orders on Mt. Natagumo.

64
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,890
And they were like, "Who trained them?"

65
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,610
What good would it do
to ask someone of my rank anyway?

66
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,400
Hashira terrify me!

67
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,780
Hello!

68
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,910
Hashira! Lady Kocho!

69
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,910
Hello!

70
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,910
Oh hello! Goodbye!

71
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,540
Oh my! Goodbye!

72
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,920
How is your recovery coming along?

73
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,420
I think we're a lot better now.

74
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,300
Then, let's have you start
your Rehabilitation Training, shall we?

75
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,180
Rehabilitation Training?

76
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,390
Yes!

77
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,810
Forgive me for being weak.

78
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,810
TWO WEEKS LATER

79
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,480
<i>Tanjiro and Inosuke were taken away
by the Hashira, Lady Kocho,</i>

80
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,560
MIRROR

81
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,560
<i>and started something
called "Rehabilitation Training."</i>

82
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,900
<i>Lady Shinobu's voice is totally unique.</i>

83
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,530
<i>I don't think I've ever heard
anything like it.</i>

84
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,570
<i>It lacks regularity,
and it scares me a little.</i>

85
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,410
<i>But when she was treating the people
who got turned into spiders,</i>

86
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,120
<i>she sure seemed like a goddess.</i>

87
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,830
<i>No wonder everyone ran
to Lady Shinobu in tears.</i>

88
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,130
<i>Not only that,
but she's unbelievably cute!</i>

89
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,840
<i>I bet she could make a living
on her looks alone.</i>

90
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:11,800
So, this cute lady has taken Tanjiro and Inosuke
to Rehabilitation Training to rebuild their stamina.

91
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,470
And any minute now...

92
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,020
<i>...they'll be back in this kind of state.</i>

93
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,150
Welcome back, Tanjiro, Inosuke!

94
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,530
How did it go today?

95
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,740
What happened?

96
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,360
What's the matter? Hey...

97
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,370
Sorry.

98
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,120
Don't mind us.

99
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,000
You gotta tell me about it!

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,120
Because I'll be joining you
a little late starting tomorrow!

101
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,130
Nooooo!

102
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,960
THE NEXT DAY

103
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,180
Scary! Scary! Scary!

104
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,720
I don't wanna go!

105
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:58,730
CALM STATE OF MIND

106
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,020
All right, since you'll be joining us
from today, Zenitsu,

107
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,730
I'll explain the process again now.

108
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,310
You'll start over there.

109
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,730
Those girls will make your bodies limber again
after having been bed-ridden for so long.

110
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,990
Next, reflex training.

111
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,780
These cups contain medicated water.

112
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,620
The objective is to throw
that medicated water onto each other,

113
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,960
but if your opponent blocks your cup
before you can pick it up,

114
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,750
you can't move that cup.

115
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,500
Now!

116
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,420
Again!

117
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:29,970
Now!

118
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,510
That's it!

119
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,260
Last up, full-body training.

120
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,220
In simpler terms, you'll be playing tag.

121
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,140
You'll be up against myself,
Aoi and Kanao over there.

122
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,400
Excuse me. May I ask you something?

123
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,190
Is there something that's not clear to you?

124
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,990
No, it's just...

125
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,990
Come on, both of you.

126
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,780
Not going.

127
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,200
Just shut up and come with me like I said!

128
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,710
Come on!

129
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,710
Come on, dammit!
You lowlifes! You dirtbags!

130
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,710
What the hell are you doing?

131
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,220
Sit up straight! I said sit up straight!

132
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,260
You miserable bastards!

133
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,890
What did you say?

134
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,890
Inosuke!

135
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,400
What were you thinking, Zenitsu?
Tell Inosuke you're sorry!

136
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,070
You guys say you're sorry!
Apologize to me!

137
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,530
How dare you act like you'd come back
from Hell when you were in Heaven!

138
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:39,450
All you did was frolic with girls all day,
so why did you look so haggard?

139
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,290
Get down on your hands and knees
and apologize! Commit seppuku!

140
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,790
How can you say such a thing?

141
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,040
Shut up, you goody-goody,
talking forehead!

142
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
Just shut up and listen, got that?

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,300
You're allowed to touch girls!
You get to have your bodies massaged!

144
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,300
When you play that cup game,
you get to touch their hands!

145
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,220
When you play tag, you get to touch
their whole freakin' bodies!

146
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,310
Each girl has two boobs,
one behind and two thighs!

147
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,480
They smell so nice when they pass by,
and it's mad fun just to look at them!

148
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,730
Heaven! Sheer heaven!

149
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,900
Cut the crap!
You're not making any sense!

150
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,740
When you lose to someone smaller
than you, it destroys your soul!

151
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,410
Oh, poor you! Inosuke, you've never been
chummy with a girl before, right?

152
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,250
Right, you were raised in the mountains!
No wonder you're a late bloomer!

153
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,000
I feel so sorry for you!

154
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,370
Snap!

155
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,050
Oh please, I've stomped
on female kids before!

156
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,510
That's the worst thing you could do!

157
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,380
Not good, no good!
That's not gonna get you any girls!

158
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,840
I can get as many girls as I want!

159
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,100
Please train me well!

160
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,240
It's all good! All good!

161
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,780
That guy has what it takes.

162
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:01,120
I'm always fighting back tears
from the pain, but he's laughing.

163
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,500
I shall take you on.

164
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,250
Begin!

165
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,210
I would never splash tea on a girl.

166
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,010
Now then, full-body training!

167
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,090
Begin!

168
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:21,930
I win!

169
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,930
I won the battle but lost the war!

170
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,940
I'm gonna kick some butt, too!

171
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,310
All right!

172
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,310
All right!

173
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,310
Ouch!

174
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,030
<i>I'm the only one
on a losing streak and soaked.</i>

175
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,610
<i>So embarrassing!</i>

176
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,200
<i>But...</i>

177
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,620
<i>I just can't beat Kanao.</i>

178
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,490
<i>None of us can get to her cup before her</i>

179
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,710
<i>or grab it away from her.</i>

180
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,710
<i>For the next five days,</i>

181
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,590
<i>I continued to lose to Kanao.</i>

182
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,710
<i>So did Inosuke...</i>

183
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,960
<i>and Zenitsu.</i>

184
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,470
<i>We couldn't so much as lay a finger
on a strand of her hair.</i>

185
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,310
<i>And then one day, the other two
stopped coming to the training room.</i>

186
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,230
Z-Zenitsu? Inosuke?

187
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,610
Please train me!

188
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,610
Thank you for a good workout.

189
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,530
<i>Why can't I beat her?</i>

190
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,240
<i>What gives her the edge over me?</i>

191
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,660
<i>First of all, her reflexes are way faster.</i>

192
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,790
<i>Even if I were 100 percent,
I'd probably lose to her.</i>

193
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,250
<i>Her scent is totally different.</i>

194
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,420
<i>It's similar to the scent of the Hashira.</i>

195
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,420
Master Tanjiro?

196
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,140
<i>Also... her eyes?
Her eyes are different!</i>

197
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,760
Master Tanjiro?

198
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,510
<i>It seems.</i>

199
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:44,930
Um...

200
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,680
Master Tanjiro, are you all right?

201
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,310
We've been calling to you over and over.

202
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,060
Sorry! I didn't hear you.

203
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,310
What's up?

204
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,820
Here's a towel for you.

205
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
Thanks! That's a big help!

206
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,450
You're all so kind!

207
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,870
Um, Master Tanjiro,

208
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,580
do you maintain the Total Concentration
Breathing state around the clock?

209
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,000
Morning, noon and night. And all through
the night while you're asleep.

210
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,420
Do you use the Total Concentration Breathing
technique nonstop?

211
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,300
No, I don't. I've never done that.

212
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,180
Is that even possible?

213
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,300
Yes!

214
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:31,430
We're told that being able to do that
makes all the difference in the world!

215
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:36,270
Even just using that technique
for a short time really takes it toll on me,

216
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,070
but I should do it
around the clock, huh?

217
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,110
Some people have already mastered it.

218
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,990
All of the Hashira and Miss Kanao!

219
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,200
Please work hard at it!

220
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,450
I see!

221
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,450
Thanks! I'll give it a try!

222
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:55,960
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

223
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,960
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

224
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,180
Isn't it about time
you came to training, Inosuke?

225
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,680
Sulking and feeling sorry for yourself
won't do you any good.

226
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,810
Zenitsu, you should come, too!

227
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,810
Yes!

228
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,810
For me, that was a good job!

229
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,190
Just tell them my injury's taken
a turn for the worse!

230
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,980
Hey, Kakushi lady over there!

231
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,070
Would you like to have
some tea with me?

232
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,160
<i>Total Concentration Breathing...</i>

233
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,330
<i>Morning, noon and night.</i>

234
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,250
<i>Even while I'm asleep. I said I'd try
to keep it up around the clock.</i>

235
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,380
<i>But I can't do it at all!</i>

236
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,090
<i>I can't do it!</i>

237
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:48,180
<i>If I try to do Total Concentration Breathing
longer, it makes me feel like I'm gonna die!</i>

238
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,800
<i>It's too painful!</i>

239
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,770
<i>My lungs hurt! My ears hurt!
My ears are ringing like crazy!</i>

240
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,180
<i>My eardrums!</i>

241
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,770
<i>That scared the heck out of me!</i>

242
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:05,030
<i>For a second there, I thought
my heart had burst through my ears!</i>

243
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,990
<i>I'll never make it at this rate!</i>

244
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,660
<i>When you're in trouble,
go back to basics!</i>

245
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,160
You spineless fool!

246
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,630
<i>Breathing is all about the lungs.</i>

247
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,550
<i>If I can't get the hang of it,
that means my lungs are too weak.</i>

248
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,090
<i>Work at it!</i>

249
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,300
<i>All I can do is work hard!</i>

250
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,260
<i>That's the story of my life!</i>

251
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,180
<i>Hard work is the sum of daily efforts!</i>

252
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,810
<i>It can be one step at a time!
Move forward!</i>

253
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,940
Right!

254
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,940
Master Tanjiro is working hard every day!

255
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,690
Yes! Let's bring him some rice balls, okay?

256
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,440
Good idea! And also...

257
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Blow into these gourds?

258
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,740
That's right.

259
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,160
Whenever she trained Lady Kanao,

260
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,710
Lady Shinobu often had
her blow into gourds.

261
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,250
Oh, really?

262
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,210
That's a neat training technique, huh?

263
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,210
So, you make some kind of sound?

264
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,420
Oh no.

265
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,840
She blew into it
to make the gourd explode.

266
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,300
Oh, really?

267
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,340
<i>Explode?</i>

268
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,350
What? You mean this?

269
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,140
Something this hard?

270
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,890
Yes!

271
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,060
Not to mention,
this is a special kind of gourd,

272
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,730
so it's harder than normal ones.

273
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,740
<i>A girl that petite was able to do that
to something that hard?</i>

274
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,740
The gourds get bigger and bigger
as you progress.

275
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,740
The one that Lady Kanao
can explode right now...

276
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,250
is this gourd.

277
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,870
Gigantic!

278
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,120
I'll give it my all!

279
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,130
THE NEXT DAY

280
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,130
They're not coming today, either?

281
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,590
I'm sorry.

282
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,550
I'll bring them tomorrow.

283
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,130
I'm sorry.

284
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,760
No. You don't have to concern yourself
with those two anymore!

285
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,140
I'll work hard.

286
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,640
I'll work hard!

287
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,850
<i>While throwing myself into the drills
that Mr. Urokodaki pounded into me,</i>

288
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,730
<i>I'm also maintaining
my Total Concentration Breathing state.</i>

289
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,730
<i>Imagining I'm running down a mountain,</i>

290
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,740
<i>I race all around the mansion's garden!</i>

291
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:14,280
<i>All of the obstacles are stand-ins
for the trees on that mountain!</i>

292
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,030
<i>Hard work!</i>

293
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,290
Hard work! Hard work!

294
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,750
Hard work!

295
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,750
15 DAYS LATER

296
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,750
<i>I've regained most of my stamina.</i>

297
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,550
<i>And now, I can run
farther than I did before,</i>

298
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,510
<i>and my lungs are getting stronger!</i>

299
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,260
<i>I'm making good progress!</i>

300
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,550
<i>During the day, I run all over the place</i>

301
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,260
<i>and put my lungs into overdrive
with swift moves.</i>

302
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,100
<i>So now, I'll breathe slow.</i>

303
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,600
<i>I'll take slow, deep breaths</i>

304
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,770
<i>and send air all the way to my fingertips.</i>

305
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,650
<i>Meditation boosts concentration.</i>

306
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,230
<i>Mr. Urokodaki said so himself.</i>

307
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,860
<i>Mr. Urokodaki...</i>

308
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:57,280
<i>How dare you break my sword!</i>

309
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,370
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

310
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,790
<i>They're reforging my sword for me now,</i>

311
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,370
<i>but I'm really, really sorry.</i>

312
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,000
<i>Concentrate! You need to concentrate!</i>

313
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,340
<i>Concentrate on your breathing!</i>

314
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,510
Yoo-hoo!

315
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,130
Yoo-hoo!

316
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,630
Yoo-hoo!

317
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,390
Yoo-hoo!

318
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,140
Yes?

319
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,260
I can see you're working very hard.

320
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,810
Even though your friends
went off somewhere...

321
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,480
Don't you feel lonely all by yourself?

322
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,200
No! Because once I've mastered it
myself, I can teach them, too!

323
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,740
You have a beautiful soul, don't you?

324
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:43,750
Um...

325
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,750
Why did you bring us all here?

326
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,210
Nezuko's existence
has been officially acknowledged,

327
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:55,720
and the three of you
were injured so seriously.

328
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,720
And also,

329
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:03,720
I'd like to entrust my dream to you.

330
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,140
Dream?

331
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,270
Yes.

332
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,020
My dream that we can
become friends with the demons.

333
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,400
I'm quite sure you can accomplish that!

334
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,530
Are you angry?

335
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,790
For some reason, I'm always picking up
an angry scent from you

336
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,040
even though you're always smiling.

337
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,960
Yes.

338
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,170
You're right.

339
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,340
It might be true that
I'm in a constant state of anger.

340
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,970
Ever since my beloved big sister
was slaughtered by a demon.

341
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:48,520
Every time I see the tears of those
who've lost their loved ones to a demon,

342
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,520
every time I hear those cries of despair,

343
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,650
the anger keeps building up inside me

344
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,360
and continues to swell.

345
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,410
Deep down in the innermost
depths of my body,

346
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,160
there's a revulsion that I can't fight.

347
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,250
I'm sure the other Hashira
feel something similar, as well.

348
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,250
Well, this time,

349
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,380
they saw Nezuko, who's never devoured
a human, with their own eyes,

350
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,760
and they've memorized her presence.

351
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,340
Out of respect for the Master's wishes,

352
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,930
I don't think anyone will raise
a hand to her.

353
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,560
My big sister was a kind-hearted
person like you.

354
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,520
She had sympathy for demons.

355
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,900
Even when she was on the brink of death,
she still felt pity for them.

356
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,700
I couldn't bring myself to feel that way.

357
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,160
How can you feel sorry
for something that's killed humans?

358
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,710
I've never heard of anything so absurd.

359
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,210
But if that was how my sister truly felt,

360
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,340
then I must carry it on.

361
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,380
If there's a way not to kill
these pitiful demons,

362
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,680
I have to keep trying to come up with it.

363
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:07,140
Without ever extinguishing the smile
that my sister said she loved...

364
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,060
<i>Sister!</i>

365
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,560
<i>Sister!</i>

366
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,810
<i>Sister!</i>

367
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:20,280
But now, I'm a bit exhausted.

368
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,990
Demons do nothing but lie.

369
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,240
Losing all reason
out of self-preservation,

370
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,580
they murder humans
with their instincts laid totally bare.

371
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,170
Tanjiro, please do all that you can.

372
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,300
Please find a way
to protect Nezuko until the end.

373
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,720
Knowing that you're working so hard
in my place reassures me to no end.

374
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,930
I can rest easy now.

375
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,820
Your Total Concentration Breathing
has come to a halt.

376
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,780
I'll work hard at it!

377
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,540
<i>Total Concentration Breathing!</i>

378
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,960
<i>Mother, Hanako...</i>

379
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,960
<i>Takeo, Shigeru...</i>

380
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,460
<i>Rokuta...</i>

381
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,340
I'm going to turn Nezuko
back into a human for sure!

382
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:16,660
PREVIEW

383
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:16,660
RUSTLE RUSTLE

384
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,860
Sniff, sniff! Lady Shinobu,
did something nice happen to you?

385
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,700
Yes! Because I've acquired
a precious drug.

386
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,410
Sniff, sniff! Are you angry?

387
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:12,450
Someone keeps swiping the candy
from the shelves.

388
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,200
Sniff, sniff!
You're also feeling sad, right?

389
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,660
There's a disturbance
in the mountain behind us.

390
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,910
Now, time for a Taisho secret!

391
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,540
Since Aoi has been training
under Lady Shinobu,

392
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,170
I hear she can concoct
the simpler medicines!

393
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,590
Nothing escapes your nose,
does it, Tanjiro? That's amazing!

394
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,130
Sniff, sniff! For some reasonâ€”

395
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:32,090
Because I enjoy talking with you, Tanjiro.

396
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,930
Thank you so much!

397
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,560
Next, Episode 25,
"Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri."
