00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,520
<i>Rui!</i>

2
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,600
<i>Rui!</i>

3
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,060
<i>Rui!</i>

4
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,810
<i>What are you doing?</i>

5
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,230
<i>You know you're not supposed to be outside!</i>

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:28,000
EPISODE 21:
AGAINST CORPS RULES

7
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,420
<i>I was always very frail</i>

8
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,340
<i>ever since I was born.</i>

9
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,880
<i>I'd never even run.</i>

10
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,010
<i>Just walking was a struggle.</i>

11
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,230
<i>Until Master Muzan appeared.</i>

12
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,610
<i>You pitiful thing. Let me save you.</i>

13
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,240
<i>My parents weren't happy about it.</i>

14
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,710
<i>Because now that I'd acquired
a strong body,</i>

15
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,170
<i>I could never expose myself to sunlight,</i>

16
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,670
<i>and I had to devour humans.</i>

17
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,260
<i>What have you done?</i>

18
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,770
<i>What on earth have you done?</i>

19
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,230
<i>Rui!</i>

20
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,530
<i>Long ago, I heard a wonderful story.</i>

21
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,870
<i>There was once a father who died
trying to save his drowning child.</i>

22
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,750
<i>I was deeply moved.</i>

23
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,550
<i>Such astounding parental love.
And such a bond, as well.</i>

24
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,550
<i>This father who drowned in the river
had fulfilled his role as a parent.</i>

25
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,140
<i>And yet,</i>

26
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,180
<i>for some reason, my own parents...</i>

27
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,320
<i>My own parents</i>

28
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,570
<i>tried to...</i>

29
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,570
<i>kill me.</i>

30
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,990
<i>All my mother did was sob,</i>

31
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,330
<i>never lifting a finger to protect me
as I was about to be killed.</i>

32
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,010
<i>They must've been imposters.</i>

33
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,640
<i>The bond between us wasn't real.</i>

34
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,850
<i>Sorry...</i>

35
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,480
<i>She's saying something.</i>

36
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,280
<i>So, she's still alive?</i>

37
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,660
<i>...for not giving you a strong,
healthy body. I'm so sorry.</i>

38
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,660
<i>Those were my mother's last words
before she died.</i>

39
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,330
<i>She died.</i>

40
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,960
<i>It's all right, Rui!</i>

41
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,090
<i>We're going to die with you!</i>

42
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,510
<i>I was so enraged
that he'd tried to kill me</i>

43
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,180
<i>that my father's words
went over my head.</i>

44
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,720
<i>But in that moment,</i>

45
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:36,850
<i>I realized that he meant to die with me
to atone for my sin of having murdered another.</i>

46
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,320
<i>It was a genuine bond.</i>

47
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,860
<i>And that night,</i>

48
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,450
<i>I severed it</i>

49
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,290
<i>with my own two hands.</i>

50
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,120
<i>Even so,</i>

51
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,840
<i>Master Muzan gave me
words of encouragement.</i>

52
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:07,380
<i>It was all your parents' fault
for refusing to accept you.</i>

53
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,050
<i>Take pride in your own strength.</i>

54
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,180
<i>I had no other choice
but to look at it that way.</i>

55
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,390
<i>I couldn't bear the weight
of what I'd done.</i>

56
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,780
<i>Even knowing that I only had
myself to blame...</i>

57
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,290
<i>Every single day...</i>

58
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,790
<i>I missed my parents so much
that I could barely stand it.</i>

59
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,420
<i>Even after creating a fake family,</i>

60
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,880
<i>the feeling of emptiness
wouldn't go away.</i>

61
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,670
<i>Since I was the one
with the most power,</i>

62
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,140
<i>there was no one who could protect me...</i>

63
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,890
<i>who could shield me.</i>

64
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,310
<i>The more powerful I became,</i>

65
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,930
<i>the less I remembered
about being a human.</i>

66
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,650
<i>And I was losing sight
of what it was that I wanted to do.</i>

67
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,020
<i>Seeking a bond
that I could never claim for myself.</i>

68
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:17,370
<i>Even though it was
simply out of my reach</i>

69
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,830
<i>no matter how I strained
to get my hands on it.</i>

70
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,470
<i>That small body...</i>

71
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,640
<i>is giving off the scent of a grief
too overwhelming for him to bear.</i>

72
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,650
LOWER FIVE

73
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,450
<i>So warm.</i>

74
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,330
<i>Hands as gentle as sunlight.</i>

75
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,750
<i>Now I remember as clear as day.</i>

76
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,340
<i>What I wanted was to apologize.</i>

77
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,680
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

78
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,600
<i>I was... I was to blame for it all.</i>

79
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,100
<i>I hope you can forgive me.</i>

80
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,860
<i>But since I've killed scores of people,</i>

81
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,690
<i>I'm going to Hell, aren't I?</i>

82
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
<i>Father...</i>

83
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,610
<i>Mother...</i>

84
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,370
<i>I can't go to the same place as you, can I?</i>

85
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,540
<i>That's not true.</i>

86
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,540
We'll be going together even if it's to Hell.

87
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,050
Rui...

88
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,920
Father...

89
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,550
Mother...

90
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,560
Rui...

91
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,140
No matter where you go,
we'll be with you.

92
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,440
It was all...

93
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,530
It was all my fault!

94
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,820
I'm sorry!

95
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,410
I'm sorry!

96
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,080
I'm sorry!

97
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,830
I'm sorry!

98
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,730
Don't waste any sympathy
on a demon that devoured humans.

99
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,280
It doesn't matter if it looks like a child.

100
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,740
It's still a hideous monster
that's lived for decades.

101
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,450
To avenge the people who were killed,

102
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,450
to make sure there are no more victims,

103
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,460
of course, I'll bring my blade down
on any demon's neck without mercy!

104
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,130
But as for those for whom
being a demon meant despair,

105
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,760
those who regretted their own actions...

106
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,800
I will never trample over them!

107
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,720
Because demons were once human, too!

108
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,350
Just like me, they were human, too!

109
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,310
Please step off him!

110
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,230
They're not hideous monsters at all!

111
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,480
Demons are hopeless creatures!

112
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,990
They're tragic creatures!

113
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,710
You're...

114
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,090
Oh my...

115
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,600
Why would you get in my way, Tomioka?

116
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,310
After telling me that we could never
be friends with demons...

117
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,070
How should I put this?

118
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,480
That's exactly why...

119
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:22,990
EVIL DEMON

120
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,450
no one likes you, you know.

121
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,990
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

122
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,000
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

123
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,020
Man, this antidote
of Lady Kocho's is effective!

124
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:54,900
That's right. And she prepared it
after one look at this situation.

125
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,110
She's truly amazing.

126
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,530
That goes for him, too.

127
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,110
Oh, that guy?

128
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,780
Because he defeated that demon,

129
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,830
it slowed the circulation
of the poison just a bit.

130
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,290
FINISHED TREATMENT

131
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,290
All right! This should do it!

132
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:22,050
KAKUSHI

133
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,750
Looking good!

134
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,920
Chances are, they'll all pull through.

135
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,210
Still, I'd like to wrap things up quickly

136
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,760
and leave this place
as soon as possible, wouldn't you?

137
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,930
Yeah, me, too.

138
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,800
I mean, this place really, really stinks!

139
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,560
All right, Tomioka,

140
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,480
please move out of the way.

141
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,990
I'm not...

142
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,660
I'm not disliked by people.

143
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,910
Well, I'm sorry. You haven't even realized
that people don't like you, then?

144
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,040
That was uncalled for.
Please forgive me.

145
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
Little boy!

146
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,630
Yes!

147
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,470
What you're protecting there is a demon.

148
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,010
I don't want you to get hurt,
so please move away.

149
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,140
Y-You're mistaken!

150
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,020
I mean, you're not mistaken, but...

151
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,600
she's my kid sister!

152
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,020
She's my kid sister, so... You see...

153
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,570
Is that right? Poor thing.

154
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,030
In that case,

155
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,580
I shall use a gentle toxin to kill her,
so she won't suffer, all right?

156
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,540
Can you move?

157
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,670
Make yourself move
even if you can't move.

158
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,210
Take your sister and run.

159
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,920
Tomioka...

160
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,010
Sorry for the trouble!

161
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,590
Thank you very much!

162
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,220
Isn't that against the Corps rules?

163
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,610
<i>My whole body is aching! It's so painful!</i>

164
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,910
<i>I want to scream from the pain!
Deal with it!</i>

165
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,410
<i>Deal with it! Deal with it! Deal with it!
Deal with it! Deal with it! Deal with it!</i>

166
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,420
<i>Does this mean I'll have to quit
the Demon Slayer Corps?</i>

167
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,550
<i>Even if she's my sister,</i>

168
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,170
<i>there's no way they'd let one of their
swordsmen travel with a demon!</i>

169
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,310
I see you're dead serious, Tomioka.

170
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,890
Who would've thought
a Hashira would ever defend a demon?

171
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,770
Whether you're dead serious or not,

172
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,780
I'm not going to join you
in stalling for time.

173
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,610
So, good day to you.

174
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,460
Is that your attempt
at catching up with me?

175
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,510
I don't mind you trying to stop me,

176
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,770
but don't forget about the other one!

177
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,480
<i>Don't stop running!</i>

178
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,070
<i>Keep moving!</i>

179
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,110
<i>You gotta run as far away as you can!</i>

180
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,370
<i>Not good!</i>

181
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,580
<i>What happened?</i>

182
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,040
<i>It was all I could do to just keep running!</i>

183
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,750
<i>Nezuko!</i>

184
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,420
DESTROY

185
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,420
<i>A Demon Slayer!</i>

186
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,260
Run, Nezuko!

187
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,140
Run! Make a run for it!

188
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,810
Don't get caught no matter what!

189
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,140
Hurryâ€”

190
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,200
She shrunk and turned into a child.

191
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,790
<i>All she's doing is running away.
Not a single attack.</i>

192
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,130
<i>But why?</i>

193
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,340
<i>No need to ponder.</i>

194
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,220
<i>My only job is to slay
this demon as I was told.</i>

195
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,560
Tomioka?

196
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,980
Are you listening, Tomioka?

197
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,980
Since the purpose of my attack was to slay
a demon, and therefore justified,

198
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,480
I don't believe it could be
construed as a violation.

199
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,110
But what you're doing
is against the Corps rules.

200
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,160
You're preventing me
from slaying a demon.

201
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,740
Just what are your intentions here?

202
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,710
Don't you have anything to say?

203
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,880
This is your final warning.

204
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,210
Give me a reason at least.

205
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,260
If I'm remembering this right,
it was two years ago.

206
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:21,140
Please don't start some long, rambling
story from that far back in time.

207
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,980
Are you just being spiteful?

208
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,770
Are you perhaps still angry
that I pointed out how people don't like you?

209
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,780
Message! Message!

210
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,360
I have a message from headquarters!

211
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,000
Tanjiro and Nezuko are to be taken into custody
and brought back to headquarters!

212
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,710
Tanjiro and the demon, Nezuko,
are to be taken into custody

213
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,590
and brought back to headquarters!

214
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:55,130
Tanjiro, dressed in a checkered haori,

215
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,180
with a scar on his forehead!

216
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,720
Nezuko, a demon girl
with a bamboo muzzle!

217
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,720
Bring them back! Bring them back!

218
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,720
Are you Nezuko?

219
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,060
Bring them back! Bring them back!

220
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,570
Tanjiro, dressed in a checkered haori,
with a scar on his forehead!

221
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,070
Nezuko, a demon girl
with a bamboo muzzle!

222
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,120
Bring them back! Bring them back!

223
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,160
He has a scar on his forehead.

224
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,460
All right, take him into custody.

225
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,170
Look. His jawbone seems
to be broken, doesn't it?

226
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,470
I feel bad about tying him up.

227
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,890
Wh-Who the hell is this?

228
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,310
I don't know.

229
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,350
A demon? Couldn't be, right?

230
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,350
Is it a human?

231
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,730
He's wearing our uniform trousers.

232
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,860
Oh hey, this is a mask! He's a human!

233
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,860
All right, let's bring him in.

234
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,740
This guy's really banged up!

235
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,240
Why's he strung up like this?

236
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,710
<i>There was nothing I could do...</i>

237
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,540
<i>On my own, I couldn't bring down
even a single demon!</i>

238
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,010
<i>You know what?</i>

239
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,510
<i>Maybe I'm not that strong.</i>

240
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:31,520
FINISHED TREATMENT

241
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,020
They wrapped us up like mummies.

242
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,610
<i>Who are these people?</i>

243
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,280
<i>They seem to be cleaning up
this place really efficiently.</i>

244
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,150
<i>And that girl there...</i>

245
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,660
<i>Isn't she the girl from Final Selection?</i>

246
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,160
<i>She has the same kind of hair ornament
as the lady who wrapped us up.</i>

247
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,750
Should we bring them
to the Butterfly Mansion, as well?

248
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,330
Yes, bring all of the wounded to our place.

249
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,710
I'll be hunting down
the demons in the area

250
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,790
so you can work without any worries.

251
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,380
<i>Come to think of it,
I've heard about them.</i>

252
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,840
<i>The cleanup crew, the Kakushis.</i>

253
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,890
<i>The unit that cleans up after
the Demon Slayer Corps battles demons.</i>

254
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:11,190
<i>They say that most of its members are people
who have no swordsmanship skills.</i>

255
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,190
It's daybreak.

256
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,990
Wake up.

257
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,870
Hey, I said wake up!

258
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:13,210
Wake... Hey! Hey you!

259
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,880
Come on, you! Come on!

260
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,630
Are you gonna sleep all day?

261
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,550
Wake the hell up, will you?

262
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,510
You're in the presence of the Hashiras!

263
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:16,040
PREVIEW

264
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:16,040
RUSTLE RUSTLE

265
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,860
Lately, we've been teaming up
on missions quite frequently, right?

266
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,900
Can you at least answer me please?

267
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,990
Or are you perhaps still angry
that I pointed out how people don't like you?

268
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,040
Don't you have anything to say?

269
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,250
Time for a Taisho secret.

270
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:22,920
Apparently, Kocho can't stand cats or dogs
or any kind of furry creature.

271
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:26,050
You finally open your mouth,
and that's the first thing you say?

272
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,340
You didn't deny it,
so does that mean it's true?

273
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,470
People don't like you
because of that lack of tact.

274
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,220
- People...
- "...do like me."

275
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,970
Any answer but that one please.

276
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,140
Next, Episode 22,
"Master of the Mansion."

277
