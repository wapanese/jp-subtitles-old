1
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,650
Were you acquainted with any of them?

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,240
There don't seem to be
any survivors around here.

3
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:25,330
We were advised that several rookie
Mizunoto had joined the battle,

4
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,630
but they might be dead by now,
don't you think?

5
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:30,880
Let's go.

6
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,220
Isn't the Moon lovely?

7
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,470
Since we've been given this
joint mission, let's try to get along.

8
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,940
I'm only here to slay some demons.

9
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,150
How callous of you!

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,440
All right, then, let's split up here.

11
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,900
I shall proceed from the west.

12
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,490
Agreed.

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,540
Don't come near my family!

14
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,130
Stay away!

15
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,130
<i>Water Breathing, Second Form!</i>

16
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,010
<i>Water Wheel!</i>

17
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:04,030
EPISODE 18:
A FORGED BOND

18
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,910
<i>It's no good!</i>

19
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,420
<i>The blade won't go through!</i>

20
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,470
So hard!

21
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,730
I can't slash him even if I use an attack!

22
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,900
What should I do?

23
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,190
What should I do?

24
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,690
Don't come near my family!

25
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,950
Stay away!

26
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,370
What are you looking at?

27
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,580
I'm over here!

28
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,080
Curse you!

29
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,260
Ouch!

30
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,430
All that force
with just one swipe of its arm!

31
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,760
It's no good! I'm not at full power!

32
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,850
Not to mention,
the bleeding's making me stumble!

33
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,230
<i>Water Breathing, Second Form...</i>

34
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,450
<i>Improved, Lateral Water Wheel!</i>

35
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,970
What was that?

36
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,890
What's going on?

37
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,010
Inosuke! You okay?

38
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,520
<i>He did that?</i>

39
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,020
<i>That was some move, dammit!</i>

40
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,360
<i>All right!</i>

41
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,030
<i>I should be able to chop off
that tough neck now!</i>

42
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,080
<i>Water Breathing...</i>

43
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,040
<i>The final and most powerful form!</i>

44
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,420
<i>He's got a different air about him now.</i>

45
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,010
<i>He's about to do
something totally mind-blowing!</i>

46
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,050
<i>Now I'll finish him off!</i>

47
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,010
<i>Total Concentration...</i>

48
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,720
<i>Water Breathing...</i>

49
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,480
<i>Tenth Form!</i>

50
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,900
L-Look out!

51
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,570
Kentaro!

52
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,830
I-Inosuke!

53
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,830
Don't die until I get back!

54
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,210
That's one of the Twelve Kizuki!

55
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,420
Don't die!

56
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,830
Don't die!

57
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,800
Whatever you do, don't die!

58
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,020
Oh, crap!

59
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,620
<i>It's getting really hard to breathe now.</i>

60
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:43,420
<i>I have no feeling
in my arms and legs anymore.</i>

61
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,640
<i>Nezuko...</i>

62
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,310
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

63
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,490
<i>Don't give up!</i>

64
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,450
<i>Don't give up!</i>

65
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,580
<i>Don't give up!</i>

66
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,660
<i>Don't...</i>

67
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,920
<i>give up!</i>

68
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,070
<i>Who are you?</i>

69
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,280
Yoo-hoo!

70
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,320
Are you all right?

71
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,420
<i>Water Breathing, Second Form!</i>

72
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,420
<i>Water Wheel!</i>

73
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,390
I managed to land somehow!

74
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,640
I beg of you! Please stop!

75
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,010
What are you looking at?

76
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,840
This isn't some show, you know.

77
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,810
Wh-What are you doing?

78
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,430
Aren't you two allies?

79
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,390
Allies?

80
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,190
Don't put us in the same category
as something that flimsy.

81
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,440
We're family.

82
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,280
We're joined by a powerful bond.

83
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
And besides,

84
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,200
this is between me and my sister.

85
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,120
So don't interfere.

86
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,160
Or I'll carve you up.

87
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,500
You're wrong!

88
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,710
Whether it's your family or an ally,

89
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
if you have a strong bond between you,

90
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,220
then either one should be just as precious!

91
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,390
Calling it flimsy
if you're not related by blood...

92
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,180
That's not true at all!

93
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:46,190
Not only that, but those who have
a strong bond give off the scent of trust!

94
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,360
But all I'm picking up from you two
is the scent of terror, hatred and repulsion!

95
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,400
That's not what you call a bond!

96
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,950
It's counterfeit!

97
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,450
It's forged!

98
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,750
You...

99
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:14,000
Hey! Look at that,
a demon that's just the right size.

100
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,760
Even I can take down
a kid demon like this one.

101
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,930
Hold up a second please!

102
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,640
You can just back off!

103
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,640
I want to take the safe route
up the ladder.

104
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,520
Since once you move up,
you get more money from the top guys.

105
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,940
My unit's practically been wiped out,

106
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:38,490
but I'll slay myself a decent-sized demon
and head down the mountain.

107
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,570
Take this!

108
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,530
Don't do it! Stop!

109
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,250
<i>Shattered to pieces in an instant!</i>

110
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,790
<i>But how did he...</i>

111
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,800
Hey, what did you say?

112
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,470
Look, you...

113
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,470
What was it that you just said?

114
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,060
<i>Just look at that intimidation factor!</i>

115
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,560
<i>The air just got heavy</i>

116
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,320
<i>and denser!</i>

117
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,900
<i>Inosuke,</i>

118
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,240
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

119
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,160
<i>Hang in there, okay?</i>

120
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,660
<i>Just a little longer!</i>

121
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,950
<i>I'll be there
as soon as I defeat this demon!</i>

122
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,250
<i>I'll come save you no matter what!</i>

123
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,210
Hey, you...

124
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,960
What you said just now...

125
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,960
Let's hear you say it again.

126
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,420
Come on.

127
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,680
Say it, will you?

128
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:42,680
Sure!

129
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,680
I'll repeat it as many times as you want!

130
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,260
Your bond is forged!

131
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,420
<i>O-Oh, crap!</i>

132
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,050
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

133
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:24,050
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

134
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
<i>Dammit!</i>

135
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,100
<i>Hiding myself in a place like this...</i>

136
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,650
<i>How pathetic is that?</i>

137
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,730
<i>Still, I gotta come up with a way.</i>

138
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,610
<i>How do you slash someone
who's sword-proof?</i>

139
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,490
<i>What should I do?</i>

140
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,200
<i>What should I do?</i>

141
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,830
<i>Just how do I slash it?</i>

142
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,500
<i>Think! Think! Think! Thinkâ€”</i>

143
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,040
Whoa!

144
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,000
This is bad! This is really bad!

145
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
Until...

146
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,970
Until he gets back,

147
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,760
I gotta somehow...

148
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,020
What the hell kind of attitude is that?

149
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,270
Don't mess around, dammit!

150
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,940
Curse you!

151
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,070
Looks like I got infected
by Tontaro's germs!

152
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,040
Messing around like that...

153
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,250
That was way too close a call!

154
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,250
Using my head? That's so not me!

155
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,670
All right!

156
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,510
Slashed you!

157
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,300
It's really simple.

158
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,350
If you can't slash something
with one sword,

159
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,770
all you gotta do is pound it
with another sword!

160
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,350
I mean, look!

161
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,230
I have two swords!

162
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,440
I'm the almighty!

163
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,950
Are you running away on me?

164
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,200
Hey you!

165
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,200
Come back here, dammit!

166
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,930
I just want to let you know...

167
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,140
I won't kill you in one blow.

168
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:36,100
After ripping you to shreds,
I'll carve you up.

169
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,360
But...

170
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,400
If you take back
what you said just now,

171
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,990
I'll do you a favor
and kill you at once.

172
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,570
I won't take it back!

173
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,070
What I said was the truth!

174
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,160
You know who's not making any sense?

175
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,490
It's you!

176
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,130
You're the one who's mistaken!

177
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,270
Damn! That bastard...
Where the hell did he go, dammit?

178
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,650
I'm telling ya,

179
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,360
this doesn't hurt!

180
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,870
What doesn't hurt doesn't hurt!

181
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,330
Now that it's come to this,

182
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,960
I'll sniff it out for sure!

183
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,510
So, there you are!

184
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,600
You idiot piece of crap!
How high did you climb up?

185
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,930
Damn you!

186
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,690
So, you're plotting to make me
use my head again, huh?

187
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,400
In your dreams!

188
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:10,530
What the...

189
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,860
Oh, I get it!

190
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,740
He's trembling with fear and dread
at the sight of me, huh?

191
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,500
Well, it's a little too late for that!

192
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,000
What the...

193
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,340
Now what?

194
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,850
D-Did it just shed its skin?

195
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,020
<i>Jeez.</i>

196
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,900
<i>Come on, that's bulking up way too much!</i>

197
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,900
<i>This is looking really bad for me!</i>

198
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:58,580
<i>I've never sensed this much force
from an opponent before!</i>

199
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,910
<i>I'll get crushed just by his force!</i>

200
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,710
<i>It's no good.</i>

201
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,670
<i>I can't win.</i>

202
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,760
<i>I'm gonna die.</i>

203
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,020
<i>I'm gonna be killed.</i>

204
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,230
Don't die!

205
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,310
Don't die until I get back!

206
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:35,280
<i>Always live your lives with great pride.</i>

207
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,780
<i>I wish you luck in battle!</i>

208
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,450
I'm not gonna lose!

209
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,790
No way am I gonna lose!

210
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,380
I'm Inosuke Hashibira
of the Demon Slayer Corps!

211
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,250
Just bring it on, you dirtbag!

212
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,090
<i>So fast!</i>

213
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,510
<i>I can't see it!</i>

214
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,140
<i>Beast Breathing...</i>

215
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,850
<i>Fang Three, Devour!</i>

216
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,440
It snapped!

217
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,780
<i>Oh, crap!</i>

218
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,030
<i>I failed to go on the defensive
with my breath attack!</i>

219
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:28,460
Don't come near my family! Stay away!

220
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,790
I'm not gonna die!

221
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,960
<i>Beast Breathing Fang One...</i>

222
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,050
<i>Take this!</i>

223
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,930
<i>Pierce!</i>

224
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,550
<i>They're in!</i>

225
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,310
<i>They're in, but...</i>

226
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,350
<i>what the hell?</i>

227
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,730
<i>This thing isn't even flinching!</i>

228
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,250
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

229
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,630
<i>I'm sorry, Inosuke.</i>

230
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,020
<i>I want at least you to survive,</i>

231
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,150
<i>Inosuke.</i>

232
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:41,740
<i>Wh-Who are you?</i>

233
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,500
<i>Wh-What was that?</i>

234
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,840
<i>Did he slash it?</i>

235
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,300
<i>That guy?</i>

236
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,590
<i>Wh-Who is that?</i>

237
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,090
<i>Who on earth...</i>

238
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,110
<i>That's fast!</i>

239
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,610
<i>Water Breathing,</i>

240
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,990
<i>Fourth Form...</i>

241
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,360
<i>Striking Tide!</i>

242
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,580
<i>H-Holy crap!</i>

243
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,590
<i>I-I've never seen anyone...</i>

244
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,630
<i>as incredible as this guy!</i>

245
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,890
<i>Got it!</i>

246
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,150
<i>The acrid odor's starting to fade,</i>

247
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,940
<i>so now I can detect
the scent of the threads!</i>

248
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,400
<i>I can take him on now!</i>

249
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,240
<i>He's smarter than I thought.</i>

250
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,870
<i>He doesn't flinch back in fear.</i>

251
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,580
<i>Well, not that it matters anyway.</i>

252
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,460
<i>Water Breathing,</i>

253
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,210
<i>First Form...</i>

254
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,880
<i>Water Surface Slash!</i>

RUSTLE RUSTLE

257
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,270
Hey!

258
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,610
Wow! Damned if you didn't take out
that demon in a flash! Who are you?

259
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,490
I saw you using the same technique
as Monjiro! You his friend?

260
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,870
What, you don't see me here?
Look at me, dammit!

261
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,330
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
What do you say to that?

262
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,080
Hey!

263
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,050
Okay, then, I'll let you in on a secret!

264
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,800
I hear that Tanjiro's favorite
rice ball flavor is plum seaweed,

265
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,550
and Zenitsu really digs salmon!

266
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,640
Next, Episode 19, "Hinokami."

267
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,600
Hey, so you can talk!
