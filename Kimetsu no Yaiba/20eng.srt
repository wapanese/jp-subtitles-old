00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,730
<i>Blood Demon Art...</i>

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,560
<i>Exploding Blood!</i>

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,240
The bond between Nezuko and me...

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,240
can't be...

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,240
severed by anyone!

6
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,010
EPISODE 20:
PRETEND FAMILY

7
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,240
Nezuko!

8
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,740
Nezuko!

9
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,410
I-I won!

10
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,240
I won!

11
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,250
My father saved me!

12
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,830
I'm not sure why I was able
to unleash that attack

13
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,460
with the kagura that's been
in our family for generations.

14
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,670
But that was what saved me!

15
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,590
I was able to beat him!

16
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,560
Huh?

17
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,980
I can't see Nezuko!

18
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,310
Is it because I took
way too many breaths?

19
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,570
This ringing in my ears is brutal!

20
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,200
My whole body is throbbing with pain!

21
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:02,870
<i>I gotta...</i>

22
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,620
<i>heal up fast!</i>

23
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,080
<i>I'm still not done fighting!</i>

24
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,880
<i>I gotta go save Inosuke!</i>

25
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,670
<i>Right away!</i>

26
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,220
<i>The scent of blood just got stronger!</i>

27
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,350
<i>Come to think of it,
it didn't give off the smell of ash.</i>

28
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,060
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

29
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,070
Even though I chopped off his head?

30
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,280
You thought you'd defeated me?

31
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,900
Poor kid.

32
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,200
Did your pathetic delusion
bring you joy?

33
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,410
I cut off my head myself
with my own threads...

34
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,290
before you could chop it off.

35
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,460
Enough.

36
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,130
I'll kill both you and your sister.

37
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,090
I haven't been this enraged in a long time.

38
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,220
<i>Get up!</i>

39
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,390
<i>Get up right now!</i>

40
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,220
<i>Get your breathing under control!</i>

41
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,310
<i>Hurry!</i>

42
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,930
<i>Right now!</i>

43
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,940
But I wonder why you're not burning up.

44
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,310
It was only me and my threads
that caught fire, right?

45
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:22,860
LOWER FIVE

46
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,320
I don't know if it's your sister's power,

47
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,860
but thanks for getting me super-annoyed.

48
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,490
Now I can carve you up with no regrets.

49
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,580
<i>If you use the correct breathing technique,</i>

50
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,080
<i>it makes no difference
how exhausted you are!</i>

51
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,580
<i>Blood Demon Art...</i>

52
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,000
<i>Murderous Eye Basket!</i>

53
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,340
<i>Don't panic!</i>

54
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,760
<i>Don't let it disrupt your breathing!</i>

55
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,300
<i>Calm down...</i>

56
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,760
<i>if you can calm down!</i>

57
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,310
<i>I can't raise...</i>

58
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,020
<i>my arm!</i>

59
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,610
<i>Somebody's here.</i>

60
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,620
<i>Is it Zenitsu?</i>

61
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,120
You did a good job holding out
until I got here.

62
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,870
Leave the rest to me.

63
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,380
You're like an endless stream...

64
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,380
of lowlifes always getting in my way!

65
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,470
<i>Blood Demon Art...</i>

66
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,430
<i>Cutting Thread Rotation!</i>

67
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,060
<i>Total Concentration...</i>

68
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,650
<i>Water Breathing...</i>

69
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,980
<i>Eleventh Form...</i>

70
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,070
<i>Dead Calm.</i>

71
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,110
Eleventh Form?

72
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,950
Who cares about your Eleventh Form?

73
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,490
What?

74
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,460
<i>What's going on? What did he do?</i>

75
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,340
<i>The instant I got up in his face,</i>

76
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,250
<i>the threads scattered.</i>

77
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,590
<i>Not one of them reached him?</i>

78
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,840
<i>The toughest threads of all got slashed?</i>

79
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,930
That's impossible!

80
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,310
One more time!

81
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,820
<i>I messed up!</i>

82
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,440
<i>I messed up!</i>

83
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,030
<i>And I was the only one
who never messed up until now</i>

84
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,910
<i>in this "Pretend Family" game!</i>

85
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,970
We finally drove her into a corner!

86
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,470
Hey, look at that.

87
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,480
A demon?

88
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,940
It's just a kid.

89
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,030
But even if it looks like a kid,
it's still a demon!

90
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,990
If we let it go, it'll devour humans!

91
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,360
Hey...

92
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,910
Hey...

93
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,780
You want me save you?

94
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,370
In return,

95
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,120
will you do what I ask?

96
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,670
I'll do anything!

97
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,290
I'll do whatever you want,
so please save me!

98
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,710
Then, become a part of my family.

99
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,720
I will! I'll do it!

100
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,550
What are they talking about?

101
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,140
All right, it's over for you!

102
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,630
Welcome.

103
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,720
Starting today,

104
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,100
you're part of my family, too.

105
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,020
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

106
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:27,020
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

107
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,580
Drink this.

108
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,670
Our family's power belongs to Rui.

109
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,550
Since we were all weak demons,
Rui shared his power with us.

110
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,470
Because Rui is one of that person's favorites,

111
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,180
he gets special permission
to do this kind of thing.

112
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,900
Do you feel it?

113
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,910
You don't have to fear
those demon hunters anymore.

114
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,370
Now then,

115
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,540
time for the finishing touches.

116
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,720
All right, you can look up now.

117
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,140
Congratulations.

118
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,810
You're truly part of the family now.

119
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,850
We're only playing house.

120
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,680
What?

121
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,430
We have no blood ties.

122
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,940
We're just a clan of assorted strangers.

123
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,860
I'm so sorry!

124
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,190
I'll do better, Rui!

125
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,860
I'll practice! Forgive me!

126
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,950
I'm so sorry I couldn't do it well!

127
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,620
It's just that I revert
by accident sometimes!

128
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,170
I don't want to hear
your excuses, Mother.

129
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,050
Play the role of mother like you should.

130
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,640
I know what I must do, Rui.

131
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,180
We were all so scared
of the demon hunters

132
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,480
and just wanted companions.

133
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,820
It's not like we wanted to take part
in this baffling "Pretend Family" game.

134
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,910
But those who fail to go along
with Rui's demands and orders

135
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,580
get carved up or have their
intellect taken from them

136
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,120
or get strung up,
exposed to the sunlight.

137
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,410
I've had enough of this.

138
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,920
I'm going to pretend
I never heard you say thatâ€”

139
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,250
I know you're not a fool.

140
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,170
Unlike all the others.

141
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,590
Let's run away together.

142
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,350
I wouldn't say this to anyone but you.

143
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,350
You're the one person
I truly think of as my younger sister.

144
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:06,120
Tomorrow, Rui is going to be summoned
by that person and descend the mountain.

145
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,830
That's our chance to escape.

146
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,240
How disappointing.

147
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,850
<i>They were all fools,</i>

148
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,520
<i>but I'm not like them!</i>

149
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,190
<i>Even so, I messed up!</i>

150
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,230
Rui!

151
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,610
Rui!

152
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,690
Mother's been killed!

153
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,410
And our elder brother, too!

154
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,950
What should we do?

155
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,660
The demon hunters aren't far behind.

156
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,370
Listen...

157
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,330
Sh-Shouldn't we make a run for it?

158
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,840
Don't...

159
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,220
You know, don't you?

160
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,470
I really hate it when your face reverts.

161
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,640
What are you looking at?

162
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,100
This isn't some show, you know.

163
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,280
<i>I only got my face slashed,</i>

164
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,190
<i>so I got off easy!</i>

165
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:07,700
A demon!

166
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,080
What the...

167
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,790
It's futile.
You'll never cut through them.

168
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,000
You see, my Ball of Yarn may feel soft,

169
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,380
but it's extremely hard.

170
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,500
Whaaa...

171
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,800
First, the solvent will melt
those clothes out of the way.

172
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,340
And then, it'll be your turn.

173
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:34,430
You'll be reduced to mush in no time,
and then I'll feed on you.

174
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,810
How amazing!

175
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,810
Do you release those threads
from the palms of your hands?

176
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,480
Good evening.

177
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,940
The moon is quite lovely tonight,
don't you think?

178
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:03,920
I can see you have no intention
of being my friend.

179
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,670
W-W-Wait!

180
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,920
I beg of you!

181
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,590
I'm being forced to do this!

182
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,680
If I defy him,
I'll be slashed to shreds!

183
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,520
Is that right?

184
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,440
That does sound tragic!

185
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:20,980
I'll spare you!

186
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,770
Let's be friends!

187
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,860
Y-You're going to spare me?

188
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,900
Yes!

189
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,200
But in order for us to be friends,

190
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,700
I must ask you a few questions.

191
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,370
Sweet young girl,

192
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,290
how many people have you killed?

193
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,540
Five.

194
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,130
But I was ordered to!
I had no choice!

195
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,130
There's no need to lie about it.

196
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,800
Because I already know.

197
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:58,720
That spell you cast to turn one of our men
into a cocoon was most impressive!

198
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,890
Help me!

199
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,310
Somebody!

200
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,310
You've devoured at least
eighty humans, haven't you?

201
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,850
No, of course
I haven't eaten that many.

202
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,230
I only killed those five.

203
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,490
But I came here
from the west, you know.

204
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,740
The west, my dear.

205
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,740
On the west side of the mountain,

206
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,330
I saw hordes of cocoons
hanging from the trees.

207
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,080
The human captives inside
had been liquefied.

208
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,750
All massacred.

209
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,000
In that spot alone, I counted
at least fourteen cocoons.

210
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,340
Fourteen humans.

211
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,260
All dead.

212
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,050
Oh, it's not that I'm angry.

213
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,810
I'm only trying
to confirm the accurate toll.

214
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,770
What good will it do you
to confirm that?

215
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,690
You'll receive the penalty
you deserve and be reborn!

216
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,020
Penalty?

217
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,030
That way, you and I
can become friends.

218
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,780
If you go unpunished
after having taken all those lives,

219
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,370
your victims will never get justice.

220
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,450
I could gouge out your eyeballs

221
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,460
or slash your stomach
to rip out your organs.

222
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,500
For every person you've killed,

223
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,550
I shall torture you.

224
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,380
And after you've suffered
through all of the pain and agony,

225
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,970
your sins will be forgiven.

226
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,930
Let's both give it our all!

227
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,600
Don't worry! Since you're a demon,
my dear, surely it won't kill you

228
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,730
and neither will there be
any after effects!

229
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,060
Who do you think you're kidding?

230
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,900
Die!

231
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,230
You damn witch!

232
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,830
I can see that we'll never be friends.

233
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,120
Oh, what a pity!

234
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,620
<i>Insect Breathing Butterfly Dance...</i>

235
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,080
<i>Caprice.</i>

236
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,500
<i>My head...</i>

237
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,380
<i>hasn't been cut off!</i>

238
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,880
<i>That's the sword she's using?</i>

239
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,300
<i>I see.</i>

240
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,970
<i>She's too tiny and has no arm strength,
so beheading is beyond her.</i>

241
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,270
<i>That's someone I can defeat!</i>

242
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:08,080
You mustn't think you're safe
just because you haven't been beheaded.

243
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:12,130
Because there are swordswomen
like me who use poison.

244
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,430
Demon Slayer Corps, Insect Hashira,

245
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,050
Shinobu Kocho.

246
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:27,140
I may be the only swordswoman among
the Hashiras unable to decapitate demons,

247
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,400
but as I've created a poison
lethal to demons, I'm also rather awesome.

248
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,150
Oh! Pardon me!

249
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,740
You're dead,
so you can't hear me, can you?

250
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,070
Careless of me!

251
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,540
Are you all right?

252
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,120
Just barely!

253
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,170
What happened to the demon?

254
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,050
Shouldn't you finish it off?

255
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,220
I killed her with wisteria poison.

256
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,680
She's already dead,
so if we leave her, she'll rot.

257
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,850
I'm a pharmaceuticals expert!

258
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,850
Your clothes did get dissolved,
but your body is more or less unscathed!

259
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,150
I'm so glad!

260
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,360
Now then,

261
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:24,870
as for the whereabouts of the demon
that forced this girl to do his bidding...

262
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:29,040
Did Tomioka beat me to it, then?

263
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:30,870
Nezuko...

264
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,160
Nezuko!

265
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,460
<i>I'll kill them! I'll kill them!</i>

266
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,920
<i>I'll kill those siblings no matter what!</i>

267
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,180
Siblings!

268
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,760
<i>What is it that you want to do, Rui?</i>

269
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,270
<i>What do you mean by "family"?</i>

270
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,480
<i>I don't know.</i>

271
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,400
<i>Because I have no memories
of when I was human.</i>

272
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:02,740
<i>Is that why you made us
pretend to be your family?</i>

273
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,870
<i>I thought that if I could feel
a family bond,</i>

274
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,450
<i>my memories would come back.</i>

275
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,960
<i>The bond of a real family...</i>

276
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,500
<i>That's right.</i>

277
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:21,920
<i>I...</i>

278
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,010
Nezuko!

279
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:13,160
PREVIEW

280
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:13,160
RUSTLE RUSTLE

281
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:05,360
That's amazing! To think you made
a poison that can kill demons!

282
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,570
I am a student
of the pharmaceutical sciences.

283
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,660
Being a Demon Slayer isn't just
about swinging a sword, you know.

284
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,160
I-I see.

285
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,740
And now, it's time for a Taisho secret!

286
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,120
I formulate my poison
inside my scabbard,

287
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,130
and no one knows how it's done
but myself and my swordsmith!

288
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:25,340
All right, I'm gonna shoot up
the ranks with a special sword, too!

289
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,590
First, you need to acquire the skill
not to get your uniform melted off!

290
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,300
Such a toxic way of putting it!

291
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,220
Next, Episode 21,
"Against Corps Rules."

292
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,390
It's always good to have high ambitions!
Let's give it our all!

293
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,980
