1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,230
Naho! Kiyo! Sumi!

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,570
I'd like you to help me train.

3
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:11,190
If I stop doing Total Concentration
Breathing while I'm asleep,

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,320
can you clobber me
with these carpet beaters?

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,070
Please help me!

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,830
Very well!

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,790
Thank you!

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,340
It's all good, right?

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,260
Master Tanjiro's doing a good job!

10
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,050
Yes!

11
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,990
EPISODE 25:
TSUGUKO, KANAO TSUYURI

12
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,200
Spineless fool...

13
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,200
Please let me try again!

14
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:21,950
Okay!

15
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
If you please!

16
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,450
Give it all you've got!

17
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,250
This time, for sure!

18
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,840
One more time please!

19
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,220
Just you again today, Tanjiro?

20
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,800
I'm sorry!

21
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,010
I did ask them to come, but...

22
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,350
Well, it doesn't matter to me.

23
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,850
I'll give them another nudge later!

24
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,570
<i>I'm starting to get used to training</i>

25
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,610
<i>while doing Total Concentration Breathing!</i>

26
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,040
<i>Although I can't sustain it all day
unless I really get myself pumped up,</i>

27
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:12,460
497! 498! 499! 500! 501!

28
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,210
<i>the longer that I can keep doing
Total Concentration Breathing,</i>

29
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,460
<i>the bigger the stamina boost I get!</i>

30
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,140
You can do it!

31
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,740
<i>Hey, I can chase after her!</i>

32
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,990
<i>I'm able to chase right after that girl!</i>

33
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,740
<i>I can keep up with her!</i>

34
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,890
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

35
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,430
Thank you very much!

36
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,110
Zenitsu! Inosuke!

37
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,780
I refuse to get involved!

38
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,130
You can do it! You can do it!
You can do it!

39
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,470
It broke!

40
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,060
Now all you have to break
is this huge gourd!

41
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,890
Yeah!

42
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,900
I did it!

43
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,560
Thanks, all of you!

44
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,610
<i>Oh, crap.</i>

45
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,710
<i>So, Tanjiro's already gone off to train.</i>

46
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,380
<i>Jeez, it's the crack of dawn.</i>

47
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,920
<i>Putting in effort isn't my thing.</i>

48
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,300
<i>There's nothing more draining
than persevering every day.</i>

49
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,930
Oh, it's you.

50
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,600
Maybe getting left behind
by Tanjiro is making me panic,

51
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,440
but I can't get the hang of anything
even if he shows me for hours!

52
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,770
Now I realize that we're a total lost cause.

53
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,980
Wait, did you just say,
"Yes, you are"?

54
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,900
How can you be so cruel?

55
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,070
Would it kill you to say just once,
"You're working hard, too"?

56
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,200
Did you just say, "Work harder"?

57
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,580
I guess there's no way out of it.

58
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,580
MEDICINE
For Zenitsu Agatsuma
Take 5 times daily
7 days' worth
After each meal

59
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,090
Gross!

60
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,520
Come on, Monitsu.

61
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:22,980
What Tanjiro is trying to master is a skill
called "Total Concentration, Constant."

62
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,360
By continuing to do Total Concentration
Breathing every second of the day,

63
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,990
your basic stamina level will skyrocket.

64
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,750
Let's just go ahead and try it!

65
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,920
Impossible!

66
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,840
Seriously impossible!

67
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,220
I still can't sustain Total Concentration Breathing
all day unless I really throw myself into it,

68
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,100
but I bet you two can do it!

69
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,850
You go like this
to make your lungs expand!

70
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:01,850
When that rattles your blood, your bones and
muscles will go, "Boom! Boom!" You gotta stop it!

71
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
All that's left to do is train like crazy!

72
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,070
Now, now...

73
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,370
We're talking about a basic skill,
or should I say a beginner's skill,

74
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,290
so why wouldn't you be able to do it?

75
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,750
But it's also true that one must put
great effort into mastering it, right?

76
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,750
CALM STATE OF MIND

77
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,380
Well, why wouldn't you
be able to do it, though?

78
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,970
I was sure it would be
child's play for you, Inosuke.

79
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,560
Are you sure you can't do it?

80
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,640
Even though there's no reason
you can't do it?

81
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,400
It can't be helped, then,
if you can't do it.

82
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,690
Can't be helped! Can't be helped!

83
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,110
I can do it, all right! Why wouldn't I?

84
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,410
Don't mess with me,
or I swear I'll rip off your breasts!

85
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,830
Please give it your all, Zenitsu!

86
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,910
I'm your biggest cheerleader!

87
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,420
Yes, ma'am!

88
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,600
Kanao, you're in the same class,
so why don't you join them?

89
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,790
More! More! Boom! Boom! Boom!

90
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,250
You damn wimp!

91
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,250
You got this, Zenitsu!

92
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
<i>It hurts.</i>

93
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,370
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

94
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,960
<i>I'm sad.</i>

95
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,210
<i>I feel hopeless.</i>

96
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,960
<i>I'm in agony.</i>

97
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,550
<i>I'm lonely.</i>

98
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,680
<i>That was my life.</i>

99
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,720
<i>But then, one day,</i>

100
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,730
<i>I heard a sound like a snap.</i>

101
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,490
<i>And I never knew pain again.</i>

102
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,990
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

103
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,990
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

104
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,290
<i>I never knew pain again.</i>

105
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,590
<i>While living in poverty,</i>

106
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,090
<i>even when my parents sold me,</i>

107
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,340
<i>it didn't make me feel sad.</i>

108
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:23,010
<i>Excuse me, do you have a minute?</i>

109
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,860
<i>Could you tell us
why that child is all tied up?</i>

110
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,070
<i>Is she a criminal, perhaps?</i>

111
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,700
<i>Isn't it obvious?
She's flea-ridden, and her face is dirty.</i>

112
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,660
<i>Not to mention, she might try to escape.</i>

113
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,990
<i>Hello, there. Nice to meet you.</i>

114
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,660
<i>My name is Kanae Kocho.</i>

115
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,920
<i>What's your name?</i>

116
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,470
<i>She's got no name, all right?</i>

117
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,300
<i>Her parents never gave her one.</i>

118
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,640
<i>Happy now? Get away from her!</i>

119
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,890
<i>Please don't touch my sister.</i>

120
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,810
<i>What's your problem, you two?</i>

121
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,440
<i>If you wanna talk to this kid, pay up!</i>

122
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,440
<i>All right, then, we'll purchase her.</i>

123
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,110
<i>Would this be enough?</i>

124
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,870
<i>Hey! Come back here, dammit!</i>

125
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,670
<i>I'd pick it up right now if I were you!</i>

126
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,840
<i>After all, there's a crowd here,
and the wind is strong!</i>

127
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,510
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

128
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,420
<i>It's fine!</i>

129
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,970
<i>Please excuse us!</i>

130
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,930
<i>Hands off! It's my property!</i>

131
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,930
<i>Oh my. Oh my.</i>

132
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,620
<i>Sister! Sister!</i>

133
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,620
<i>Sister, this child is hopeless!</i>

134
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,090
<i>She can't do anything without being told!
That goes for meals, as well!</i>

135
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,630
<i>She won't touch her food
unless I tell her to eat!</i>

136
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,130
<i>Even as her stomach growls and growls!</i>

137
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,140
<i>Oh my. Oh my.</i>

138
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,470
<i>What exactly are we going to do with her?</i>

139
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,020
<i>Now, now, don't be like that, okay?</i>

140
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,230
<i>I just love that smile of yours, Shinobu.</i>

141
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:40,360
<i>But we can't do anything with a kid who can't
even think for herself! It's dangerous!</i>

142
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,360
<i>Well, you do have a point, but...</i>

143
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,320
<i>She can't do anything on her own!
She can't decide for herself!</i>

144
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,450
<i>All right, when you're on your own,
you can decide by flipping this coin.</i>

145
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,160
<i>Right, Kanao?</i>

146
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,660
<i>Sister!</i>

147
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,920
<i>You don't have to take this
so seriously, you know...</i>

148
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,960
<i>since Kanao is so adorable!</i>

149
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,800
<i>That's not a good reason!</i>

150
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,050
<i>As long as it's given a chance,</i>

151
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,800
<i>a person's soul will open up,
so don't worry.</i>

152
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,680
<i>When you fall in love
with some boy someday,</i>

153
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,600
<i>you'll change, too, Kanao.</i>

154
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,560
You're doing great! Keep it up!

155
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:22,230
Right now! Harder! Bam!
That's it! You can do it, Zenitsu!

156
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,200
You've got this! Looking good!

157
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,080
Inosuke! Inosuke!

158
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,880
They'll be bringing
our reforged Nichirin Swords soon!

159
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,760
For real?

160
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,720
Yeah! I just heard it from the crow!

161
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,300
That's Mr. Haganezuka's scent!

162
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,100
Yahoo!

163
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,810
Let's go! Let's go!

164
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,770
Yahoo!

165
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,850
Mr. Haganezuka!

166
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,900
Hey! Hey! Mr. Haganezuka!

167
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,400
Long time no see!

168
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,030
How have you been?

169
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,210
M-Mr. Haganezuka?

170
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,250
How dare you snap my sword in two?

171
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,550
You've got a lot a nerve!

172
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,220
I'm sorry! B-But to be honest,
I came this close to being killed!

173
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,050
My opponent was insanely strong!

174
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,800
Not true! That has nothing to do with it!

175
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,770
You're the one to blame!
It's all your fault!

176
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,390
You're pitifully weak!
That's why it broke!

177
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,270
Otherwise, my sword
would never snap like that!

178
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,900
But...

179
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,480
I'm going to kill you!

180
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,660
Is that a new training regimen?

181
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,660
Probably not.

182
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,120
Well, Mr. Haganezuka
is a very passionate man.

183
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,420
Yes.

184
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,090
He loves his swords more than anyone.

185
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,130
There's no one like him
even in the sword-forgers' homeland.

186
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,130
You're probably right.

187
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,930
My name is Kanamori.

188
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,140
I was the one who forged
Master Inosuke's swords.

189
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,640
I would be thrilled
if they prove useful in battle.

190
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,240
Beautiful, aren't they?

191
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,740
The dull sheen of that
indigo-gray hue is so cool.

192
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,660
It's a fine color for a sword.

193
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,580
I'm happy for you, Inosuke,
since your sword was chipped all over.

194
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,670
How do you like the grips?

195
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,420
The thing is, this is the first time
I've ever forged swords for a dual-wielder.

196
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,180
Master Inosuke?

197
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:06,770
Better.

198
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,360
I'll kill you, you miserable brat!

199
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,530
You bastard! Are you flaunting it?

200
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:14,240
We're sorry! We're sorry!

201
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:22,040
Bastard! That's it! You're a dead man!

202
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,460
Unbelievable! He's unbelievable!

203
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,920
We're sorry!

204
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,460
We're sorry!

205
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,920
Taking a stone to those swords?
Unbelievable!

206
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,840
We're sorry! We're sorry!

207
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,800
We're sorry!

208
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,180
Looks like he'll be fine.

209
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,810
After all, Master Tanjiro
was really giving it his all!

210
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,060
Let's make him some rice balls again!

211
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,310
Yeah!

212
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,870
<i>My body's changed!</i>

213
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,950
<i>I can't wait to swing my sword!</i>

214
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,370
<i>With these hands!</i>

215
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,950
<i>My Nichirin Sword!</i>

216
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,080
<i>I did it!</i>

217
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,970
Good move! You can do it!

218
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:17,090
<i>Don't let up for a second! You can do it!</i>

219
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,970
<i>I did it!</i>

220
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,230
<i>Go!</i>

221
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,900
SENSE OF REASON

222
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,900
TAN

223
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,900
<i>This medicated water stinks.
It would be cruel to splash her with it.</i>

224
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,650
- He won!
- Does that count as winning?

225
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,660
Either way, it's the same thing!

226
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,950
Yeah! I did it!

227
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,750
I did it!

228
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,750
- Oh, crap.
- Oh, crap.

229
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,510
All right! Open up!

230
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,680
Okay! Looks like your jaw
is as good as new.

231
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,140
All right, you can close your mouth now.

232
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,560
That concludes this exam.

233
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,520
Since you're physically sound now,

234
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,150
you may take on your missions
without any misgivings.

235
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
So, I'm done with my training?

236
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,570
Yes. All that's left for you now
is actual combat.

237
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,400
Right!

238
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,660
Oh, before I forget, Lady Shinobu...

239
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,780
There's something I wanted to ask you.

240
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,410
What would that be?

241
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,370
Have you ever heard
of the Hinokami Kagura Dance?

242
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,670
I have not.

243
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,580
Uh, w-well then,

244
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,130
how about Fire Breathing?

245
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,380
Never heard of it.

246
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,590
A-Actually, this is something
that happened during my childhood.

247
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,890
Yes, yes.

248
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,760
I see.

249
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:48,140
So, for some reason, Tanjiro,
your father used Fire Breathing.

250
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,520
All I can tell you is that
while Flame Breathing does exist,

251
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,780
it's not Fire Breathing.

252
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,570
What? They're not the same thing?

253
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,030
I'm not familiar with the details myself.

254
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,570
Please forgive me.

255
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,790
But I do know that they're very strict
about the exact phrasing.

256
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,710
"Flame Breathing" must never
be referred to as "Fire Breathing."

257
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,670
The Flame Hashira, Rengoku,
might know something about this,

258
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,550
but unfortunately, he's out on a mission.

259
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,340
Understood!

260
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,180
Thank you for all that you've taught me.

261
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,560
I'll ask Mr. Rengoku if I ever get
a chance to see him again.

262
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:25,640
Right.

263
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,430
Now then, please excuse me!

264
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,680
Kamado?

265
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,560
Yes?

266
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,060
I'm expecting great things of you.

267
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,570
Right!

268
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,340
She's asleep all day again today.

269
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:03,760
I know they said you could be sleeping
to recover your stamina,

270
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:09,140
but it does worry me if you don't open
your eyes once in a while.

271
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:18,650
Hey, I'll probably be leaving this place
soon to go on my next mission.

272
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,490
I've healed physically,
and I've gotten a little stronger, too.

273
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,910
And I'm still doing
Total Concentration, Constant right now.

274
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,120
I think Zenitsu and Inosuke
will be with me, too.

275
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,000
Having those two by my side
gives me confidence.

276
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,920
I see.

277
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,960
You think so, too, Nezuko?

278
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,670
They're both good guys.

279
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,300
To turn you back into a human,

280
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,720
I gotta bring down
the strongest demons that I can,

281
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,560
and send Miss Tamayo
their blood samples.

282
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,600
<i>Am I capable of doing that?</i>

283
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,650
<i>I know you can do it, Big Brother.</i>

284
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,200
Thanks, Nezuko.
You just encouraged me, didn't you?

285
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,000
I'll try my hardest, all right?

286
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:11,160
PREVIEW

287
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,730
Maintaining Total Concentration
Breathing is way too demanding!

288
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,950
It's totally not happening, dammit.

289
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,070
You both look wiped out.

290
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,160
I know!

291
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,910
Here's a Taisho secret for you!

292
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,370
The medicated water we use
for reflex training, when added to your bath,

293
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:20,710
is actually great for healing
exhaustion and wounds.

294
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,420
Well, I'm going off to train,
but maybe you two should take a break.

295
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,880
I'm nowhere near done yet!
Don't underestimate me!

296
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,840
We'll train some more?

297
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,220
All right! All we gotta do
is show up, right?

298
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:34,220
Next, Episode 26, "New Mission."

299
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,600
Okay, I'm heading out now, Nezuko!

300
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,020
TO BE CONTINUED
