1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,560
That mask.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,350
I can tell by the fox masks.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,480
Everyone got eaten just because
they were wearing them.

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,080
<i>Total Concentration!</i>

5
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,960
<i>Water Breathing!</i>

6
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,760
<i>First Form!</i>

7
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,520
<i>Water Surface Slash!</i>

8
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,990
EPISODE 5:
MY OWN STEEL

9
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,990
Urokodaki!

10
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,630
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!

11
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,970
My body's crumbling and disappearing.

12
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,930
I can't stop it!

13
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,310
Dammit!

14
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,440
To think that the face of a Demon Hunter
will be the last thing I'll ever see...

15
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,910
How did it come to this?

16
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,040
I'm so scared. I'm all alone.

17
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,840
Brother, where are you?

18
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,300
I want you to hold my hand!

19
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,470
Like you always do!

20
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,720
Why?

21
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,230
Why on earth did I bite you
to death, Big Brother?

22
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,650
Huh?

23
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,650
Wait, who's this "Brother" person?

24
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,740
What a sad scent.

25
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,720
God...

26
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,050
Please...

27
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,680
The next time this man is reborn,

28
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,060
please make sure
he doesn't turn into a demon.

29
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,570
Brother!

30
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,820
Brother! Brother!

31
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,030
Hold my hand, will you?

32
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,370
You're hopeless, you know?

33
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,040
Still such a scaredy-cat.

34
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,440
<i>Sabito, Makomo...</i>

35
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,650
<i>and everyone else who were killed...</i>

36
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,820
<i>I won.</i>

37
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,400
<i>You can rest easy now.</i>

38
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,420
<i>I guess you're going home as promised.</i>

39
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,500
<i>Even though you're just souls,
you're going back to Mt. Sagiri...</i>

40
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,850
<i>...and to Mr. Urokodaki
whom you love very much.</i>

41
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,940
<i>If I'd ended up dead,</i>

42
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,360
<i>my soul would've returned there, too.</i>

43
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,290
There's something I wanna ask you!

44
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,840
How do I turn someone who's become
a demon back into a human?

45
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
Please tell me!

46
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,230
How can I turn Nezuko...

47
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,190
back into a human?

48
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,690
Wisteria?

49
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,190
I made it.

50
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,830
<i>Only four of us?</i>

51
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,130
<i>But there were at least twenty.</i>

52
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,840
<i>I don't see that guy here, either.</i>

53
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,390
It's all because I blacked out
at that moment.

54
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,180
I couldn't save him.

55
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,930
I'm gonna die. I'm a goner.

56
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,060
Even if I survive now,
I'm gonna die in the end anyway.

57
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,940
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back.

58
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,530
Congratulations.

59
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,580
We're pleased to see that you're safe.

60
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,750
So? What am I supposed to do now?

61
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,710
Where's my sword?

62
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,790
First, we shall issue you all uniforms.

63
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:37,380
We will take your measurements,
after which your rank will be engraved.

64
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,220
There are ten ranks in all...

65
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,600
Kinoe.

66
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,640
Kinoto.

67
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
Hinoe.

68
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
Hinoto.

69
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,600
Tsuchinoe.

70
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,850
Tsuchinoto.

71
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,850
Kanoe.

72
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,900
Kanoto.

73
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,110
Mizunoe...

74
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,860
...and Mizunoto.

75
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:58,360
Currently, you are
at the lowest rank, Mizunoto.

76
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,200
And our swords?

77
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:06,660
Today, we will let you
choose the ore for your swords.

78
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,090
However, the swords will take
ten to fifteen days to complete.

79
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,250
Are you kidding me?

80
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,500
But first...

81
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:27,600
We will now assign each of you
your own Kasugai Crow.

82
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,860
Kasugai Crow?

83
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,990
These Kasugai Crows can be used
primarily for communication.

84
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,110
Did you say "crow"?

85
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,030
Isn't this a sparrow, though?

86
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,700
Don't give me that crap!

87
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,080
Who the hell cares
about some stupid crow?

88
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,800
I want a sword, you hear?

89
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,130
Gimme one right now!

90
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,300
The Demon Slayers' sword!

91
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,470
The Color Changing Sword!

92
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,560
Take your hand off her!

93
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,190
Or else I'll break your arm!

94
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,440
Who the hell are you?

95
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,200
Wh-Wh-Wh-What should I do?

96
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,320
Let's see you try it!

97
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,680
Are you finished chatting?

98
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,730
Now then, please select an ore.

99
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,490
The steel for the sword...

100
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,740
that will annihilate demons and protect you...

101
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,070
will be of your own choosing.

102
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,620
Well, not that I'm going to live
very long. Probably.

103
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,790
<i>They're asking us to choose,</i>

104
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,550
<i>but how are we supposed to pick one out?</i>

105
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,340
<i>I've never seen an ore before,</i>

106
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,390
<i>and I can't tell the difference anyway.</i>

107
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,680
I have absolutely no clue.

108
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,910
I see.

109
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,670
As many as five of them
managed to survive, huh?

110
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,130
Excellent.

111
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,180
The number of my children
has increased again.

112
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,390
I wonder what kinds of swordsmen
they'll become.

113
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,660
<i>I was so naive.</i>

114
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,670
<i>I couldn't even have a talk with a demon.</i>

115
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,840
<i>All they did was attack me
and try to kill me right away.</i>

116
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,670
Sorry, Nezuko.

117
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,260
I never got to ask them...

118
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,970
how to turn a demon back into a human.

119
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,820
<i>Even my uniform is heavy.</i>

120
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,900
<i>I wanna get home as soon as possible,</i>

121
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,280
<i>but my whole body hurts.</i>

122
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,060
I made it.

123
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,520
Nezuko... Mr. Urokodaki...

124
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,990
Hey! Nezuko!

125
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,200
You...

126
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,120
So, you're awake?

127
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,290
Nezuko!

128
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:14,890
Why...

129
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,890
Why'd you fall asleep all of a sudden?

130
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,730
Never waking up once!

131
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,190
I was worried
you were going to die, you know?!

132
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,700
You came back to us alive.

133
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,260
I see. You killed that morphed demon.

134
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,510
Yes.

135
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,060
At last.

136
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,770
I'm truly impressed
that you made it back.

137
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,020
Yes.

138
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,980
There are several kinds of demons.

139
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:13,200
The demons who use a special spell
called the "Blood Demon Art"

140
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,030
possess supernatural abilities.

141
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:21,040
You may have to fight
those demons, as well, from now on.

142
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:26,540
And battling them will be far more difficult
than anything you've known until now.

143
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:32,300
Even so, Tanjiro,
I'm sure you'll be fine.

144
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,800
Right.

145
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:37,930
Um...

146
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:41,810
I think that Nezuko's not
like the other demons.

147
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,350
Do you think it could it be
that Whatchamacallit Art?

148
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,480
No, I don't think so.

149
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:52,360
I wouldn't call that an example
of the Blood Demon Art.

150
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,320
I'm just guessing here,

151
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,990
but it could be that Nezuko's recovering
her strength by sleeping

152
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:03,410
instead of consuming human flesh.

153
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,750
<i>I'll protect you, Nezuko.</i>

154
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,560
15 DAYS LATER

155
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,160
Uh...

156
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,160
My name is Haganezuka.

157
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,920
I have forged Tanjiro Kamado's sword,

158
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,630
and I am here to deliver it.

159
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,800
Um, I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

160
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,340
Please come inside.

161
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,180
This is the Nichirin Sword.

162
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,680
And I forged it.

163
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,720
Um...

164
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,600
Please come in
so I can serve you some teâ€”

165
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,310
The materials for a Nichirin Sword

166
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,560
can be obtained from the mountain
closest to the sun.

167
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:12,110
Scarlet Crimson Iron Sand
and Scarlet Crimson Ore.

168
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,450
These produce steel
that can absorb sunlight.

169
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,610
Wow, is that right?

170
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:22,660
Mt. Yoko is bathed in sunlight
all day long, you see.

171
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,580
Never a cloud in the sky,
nor any rain.

172
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,660
There he goes again,

173
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,540
You're going to get dirty,
so could you get up for a second?

174
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,000
never listening to what others say...

175
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,210
A clown mask?

176
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,380
Hey, you're a Child of Brightness, aren't you?

177
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,890
Now that's what I call lucky.

178
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,100
Oh no, I'm the son of Tanjuro and Kie.

179
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,310
That's not what I meant.

180
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,730
See how your hair and eyes
are a reddish color?

181
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,530
When a kid like you is born
into a family that works with fire,

182
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,490
it's considered lucky
and a cause for celebration.

183
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,820
Is that right? I had no idea.

184
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:05,410
There's a good chance
that this sword will turn red!

185
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,450
Right, Urokodaki?

186
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,040
Yeah.

187
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,960
Come on, hurry up and draw it!

188
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,930
Nichirin Swords are also known
as "Color Changing Swords."

189
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,560
They change color
depending on the bearer.

190
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,670
Black!

191
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,340
It's black, huh?

192
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,590
Is it bad or something
if it turns black?

193
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,630
Is it unlucky?

194
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,970
No, not necessarily.

195
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,010
But you don't see
this pitch black too often.

196
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,520
And I was so hoping
I'd get to see a bright red sword!

197
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,020
Dammit!

198
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,650
Ouch! Stop!

199
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,820
Please calm down!
How old do you think you are?!

200
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,660
I'm thirty-seven!

201
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,040
Tanjiro Kamado!

202
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,080
Here are your orders!

203
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,840
It talks!

204
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:41,340
Make your way to a town
to the northwest!

205
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:45,340
Young girls have been vanishing there!

206
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,240
Night after night,

207
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,780
young girls have been vanishing!

208
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,500
Hunt down the demon
lurking there and kill it!

209
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,250
Tanjiro Kamado, prepare yourself
well for this task!

210
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,090
This is your first assignment

211
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,090
as a Demon Hunter!

212
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,930
My first... assignment...

213
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:16,370
PREVIEW

214
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:16,370
RUSTLE RUSTLE

215
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,820
Kasugai Crow, say hello to everyone.

216
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,450
I don't take orders from you!

217
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,000
Jeez.

218
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,620
Now, it's time for a Taisho secret!

219
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:24,090
Forget that! It's time
for the next mission! Hurry up!

220
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,630
All right! I got it!

221
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,970
Next, Episode 6,
"Swordsman Accompanying a Demon"!

222
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:34,930
Hey, you there!
If you miss it, I'll peck you!

223
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:35,930
Hey!

224
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:39,980
