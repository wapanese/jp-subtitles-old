1
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,610
Wake up.

2
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,410
Hey, I said wake up!

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,830
Wake... Hey! Hey you!

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,490
C'mon, you! C'mon!

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,250
Are you gonna sleep all day?

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,120
Wake the hell up, will you?

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,130
Bummer. I heard he was
a Demon Slayer with a demon in tow,

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,720
so I was looking forward
to seeing someone flamboyant,

9
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,760
but that's one drab-looking dude, huh?

10
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,720
And now, we'll put this boy on trial!

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:42,890
I see!

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,900
<i>To think that he's been protecting
his sister who's now a demon...</i>

13
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,400
<i>Now that's beautiful sibling love!
How brave!</i>

14
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,160
Wh-Who are these peop—

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,490
DESTROY

16
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,700
Don't open your mouth
just yet, you moron!

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,490
Just who do you think
is standing before you?

18
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,540
You're in the presence of the Hashiras!

19
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,790
<i>Hashiras?</i>

20
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,540
<i>What is a Hashira?</i>

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,880
<i>What's he talking about?</i>

22
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,550
<i>And who are these people exactly?</i>

23
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,520
KAKUSHI

24
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,020
<i>Where am I now?</i>

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,270
This is the Demon Slayers' headquarters.

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,070
And you're about to be put on trial...

27
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,110
Tanjiro Kamado.

28
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,960
EPISODE 22:
MASTER OF THE MANSION

29
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,260
Before we start the trial,

30
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,680
why don't you explain
the crime you've comm—

31
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,680
There's no need for a trial!

32
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:36,110
FLAME HASHIRA
KYOJURO RENGOKU

33
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,230
Protecting a demon
is a clear violation of the code!

34
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,810
We're within our rights
to deal with him on our own!

35
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,110
We're going to behead him
along with the demon!

36
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:47,120
SOUND HASHIRA
TENGEN UZUI

37
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,150
In that case, I'll be glad
to decapitate him flamboyantly.

38
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,660
I'll show you the most flamboyant
bloodspray you'll ever see.

39
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,120
I'm talking max flamboyance.

40
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:57,130
LOVE HASHIRA
MITSURI KANROJI

41
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,330
<i>What?</i>

42
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,670
<i>You'd kill such an adorable child?</i>

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,130
<i>That pains my heart!
It fills me with anguish!</i>

44
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:09,140
STONE HASHIRA
GYOMEI HIMEJIMA

45
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,800
Ah, what a pitiful sight this boy is.

46
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,800
The poor soul...

47
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,510
I pity him for having been born at all.

48
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:17,400
MIST HASHIRA
MUICHIRO TOKITO

49
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,810
<i>Um, what was the shape
of that cloud again?</i>

50
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,650
<i>What was it called again?</i>

51
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,020
<i>Where's Nezuko?</i>

52
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,820
<i>Nezuko!</i>

53
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,280
Hey you...

54
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,780
The Hashiras are speaking.
What are you looking at?

55
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,000
These are the nine highest-ranking
swordsmen in the Demon Slayer Corps.

56
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,710
Hashiras...

57
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,670
Let's put him out of his misery.

58
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,590
Yeah! Let's do it. Flamboyantly.

59
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:43,800
Hey!

60
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,340
Nezuko...

61
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,390
Nezuko, where are you?

62
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,970
Nezuko!

63
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,260
Zenitsu!

64
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,060
Inosuke!

65
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,890
Murata!

66
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:58,060
Forget that.
What will we do with Tomioka?

67
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,280
Seeing him there without any restraints
is giving me a headache.

68
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,370
Based on what Kocho told us,

69
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,040
Tomioka's just as guilty
of breaking the Corps rules.

70
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:20,750
SERPENT HASHIRA
IGURO OBANAI

71
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,080
How will we deal with him?

72
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,040
How should we make him
take responsibility?

73
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,340
What kind of lesson
should we teach him?

74
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,380
Don't you have anything to say, Tomioka?

75
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,680
<i>Because of me, now even Tomioka...</i>

76
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,810
<i>Iguro, you're as serpent-like
as ever! Such a nag!</i>

77
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,560
<i>I love how pesky you are!</i>

78
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,240
<i>Tomioka! All by himself at a distance!</i>

79
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,080
<i>How cute!</i>

80
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,830
WATER HASHIRA
GIYU TOMIOKA

81
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,830
Oh, where's the harm?

82
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,290
He did come along without resisting.

83
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,540
Let's come up with a penalty later.

84
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,840
INSECT HASHIRA
SHINOBU KOCHO

85
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,430
What I'm more interested in
is hearing this boy's story.

86
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:15,100
The reason he's going on missions with a demon
in tow despite being a Demon Slayer...

87
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,190
I'd like to hear the explanation
from the boy himself.

88
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,610
Needless to say, what he's done
is against the Demon Slayer Corps rules.

89
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,400
You are aware of that, aren't you?

90
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,620
Tanjiro Kamado...

91
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:38,120
Why are you traveling with a demon
when you're a Demon Slayer?

92
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,540
No need to ask.

93
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,510
You can take your time.
Just tell us why.

94
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,720
She's my...

95
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,300
She's my younger—

96
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,730
I do believe you need some water.

97
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,740
You've injured your jaw,
so please drink slowly.

98
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,950
It contains a painkiller,
so it will make you feel better.

99
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:29,090
It's not as if your wounds are healed,
so you mustn't push yourself.

100
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,300
Now then, Tanjiro Kamado...

101
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,180
That demon is my younger sister!

102
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,730
While I was away, my family
was attacked by a demon,

103
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,900
and when I got home,
they were all dead!

104
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,190
My sister got turned into a demon,

105
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,070
but she's never devoured anyone!

106
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,690
She never has...

107
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,280
and never will!

108
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,530
She'll never hurt humans no matter what!

109
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,950
Spare us your absurd ravings.

110
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,210
If she's family,
no wonder you're defending her.

111
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,460
I can't trust a single word you're saying.

112
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,920
I, for one, don't believe you.

113
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,090
She's been possessed by a demon.

114
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,180
Let us kill this poor child immediately
so that she can be liberated!

115
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,850
Listen to me please!

116
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,770
I became a swordsman
so that Nezuko could be cured!

117
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,230
It's been two years
since Nezuko became a demon!

118
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,280
And in all that time,
she hasn't devoured one human!

119
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,200
Your story's spinning
in the most drab way possible, idiot.

120
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,530
The fact that she hasn't eaten anyone,
that she won't from now on.

121
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,700
Don't just give us lip service.
Prove it to us with max flamboyance.

122
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,840
What was that bird again?

123
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,340
Um...

124
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,050
Excuse me?

125
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,800
I do have my doubts, you know.

126
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:59,720
I just can't imagine the Master
being in the dark about this situation.

127
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,940
Do you really think it's okay
to deal with him without his permission?

128
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,190
Shouldn't we at least wait
until he arrives?

129
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,240
My sister...

130
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,070
My sister will fight with me by my side!

131
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:21,200
She can fight as a Demon Slayer
to protect humans!

132
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,450
So please...

133
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,880
KILL

134
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,880
Well, well, I see you have
some fun brewing here.

135
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,510
Is that the moron Slayer
who has a demon with him?

136
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,930
What the hell are you trying to pull here?

137
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,140
WIND HASHIRA
SANEMI SHINAZUGAWA

138
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,520
<i>Shinazugawa!</i>

139
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,150
<i>You've gained even more scars!
How gorgeous you look!</i>

140
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,730
This won't do, Master Shinazugawa!

141
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,570
Please, would you mind
putting down that box?

142
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,280
<i>Shinobu looks pretty angry!
Now, that's unusual!</i>

143
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,410
<i>She's so cool!</i>

144
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,790
Shinazugawa, please don't act out of line.

145
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,500
What did you say about that demon, kid?

146
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,300
That she can fight as a Demon Slayer
to protect humans?

147
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,550
You know what we call that?

148
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,140
A total delusion, you moron!

149
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,270
Anyone who hurts my sister...

150
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,530
Hashira or not,
I won't let you get away with it!

151
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,490
Is that right? Good for you!

152
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,030
Stop it!

153
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,910
The Master will be arriving soon!

154
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,390
Pardon me.

155
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,940
Damn you!

156
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:20,200
<i>Even though Tomioka ran interference,
he still landed a blow on Shinazugawa.</i>

157
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,200
If you can't tell the difference
between good demons and bad,

158
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,740
you should just quit being a Hashira!

159
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,710
You little...

160
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,170
I'll destroy you!

161
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,340
- The Master...
- The Master...

162
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,010
- ...has arrived.
- ...has arrived.

163
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,480
So good of you to come.

164
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,530
My beloved children...

165
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,950
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

166
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:10,960
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

167
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,710
- The Master...
- The Master...

168
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,290
- ...has arrived.
- ...has arrived.

169
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,330
Good morning, everyone.

170
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,040
The weather is amazingly good today.

171
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,880
I wonder if the sky is blue.

172
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:02,760
It pleases me that we've made it
to our semiannual Hashira Meeting

173
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,300
with no personnel changes.

174
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,010
<i>Wounded.</i>

175
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,930
<i>No, is he sick?</i>

176
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,640
<i>So, that man's the Master?</i>

177
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,940
<i>So quick! I couldn't even react!</i>

178
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,270
<i>This...</i>

179
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,290
I am pleased to see you
in good health, as well, Master.

180
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,420
I fervently pray
for your continued good fortune.

181
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,630
Thank you, Sanemi.

182
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,680
<i>I wanted to say that!</i>

183
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,180
<i>Offer my greetings to the Master!</i>

184
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,680
If I may, Master...

185
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:58,190
Before we start the Hashira Meeting,
would you mind enlightening us

186
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,270
about this swordsman, Tanjiro Kamado,
accompanied by a demon?

187
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,240
<i>He didn't seem to have
a drop of intellect or logic,</i>

188
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,610
<i>but he's speaking so formally now!</i>

189
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,080
Right.

190
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,250
I apologize for startling you all.

191
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,960
About Tanjiro and Nezuko...
I've sanctioned their situation.

192
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,590
And I'd also like you all to accept it.

193
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:35,810
Even if it's what you desire,
Master, I cannot agree to it.

194
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,980
I'm flamboyantly opposed, as well!

195
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,730
A Demon Slayer traveling
with a demon is unacceptable!

196
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:47,030
I shall do whatever it is you wish, Master!

197
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,660
I'm fine either way...

198
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,830
since I'm going to forget anyway.

199
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,460
I won't trust them. I won't trust them.

200
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,380
In the first place, I loathe demons.

201
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,590
Although I respect you with all my heart,
that's an incomprehensible notion, Master!

202
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,890
I oppose it with everything I've got!

203
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,390
The Demon Slayer Corps' mission
is to annihilate demons.

204
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:19,390
I request that you penalize
both Kamado and Tomioka!

205
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,520
The letter.

206
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,230
Yes, Master.

207
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,830
This is a letter received
from a former Hashira,

208
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,120
Sakonji Urokodaki.

209
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,830
I shall read you an abridged version.

210
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:50,170
"Please allow Tanjiro to be accompanied
by his sister, a demon.

211
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,590
Because of her resilient mental strength,

212
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,510
Nezuko has not lost her human emotions.

213
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,100
<i>Even in a starved state,
she never devoured humans,</i>

214
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,850
<i>and this has held true
more than two years later.</i>

215
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,940
<i>Although the situation seems somewhat
far-fetched, it is an indisputable fact.</i>

216
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:14,700
<i>In the event that Nezuko does assault
a human, Tanjiro Kamado, as well as...</i>

217
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:20,830
...Sakonji Urokodaki and Giyu Tomioka
will atone by committed seppuku."

218
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,850
So, what if they commit seppuku?

219
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,900
If you want to die,
then rot to death for all I care!

220
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,230
It's no guarantee! Not by a long shot!

221
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,480
Shinazugawa is right!

222
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:53,450
If she kills and devours human,
there's no coming back from that!

223
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,360
It won't bring back
the people who were killed!

224
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,080
You do have a point.

225
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,620
In that case...

226
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,950
Master!

227
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,290
We can't guarantee
that she won't attack humans.

228
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,460
We can't prove it.

229
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,340
That said...

230
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,760
We also can't prove
that she will attack humans.

231
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:24,770
The fact is that Nezuko has refrained from
devouring humans for more than two years,

232
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:28,400
and also that there are three people
risking their lives for her.

233
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,570
To reject this notion,

234
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,780
those who reject it must offer
an even more convincing argument.

235
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,200
Do you all have the will to do so?

236
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:48,080
Also, there's something
I'd like to relay to you, my children.

237
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,880
Tanjiro here has met Kibutsuji.

238
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,590
No, impossible!

239
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,800
Even when no Hashira has ever
crossed paths with him?

240
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,010
You mean this kid...

241
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,640
What did he look like?
What about his powers?

242
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,350
Where did this take place?

243
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,480
Did you battle him?

244
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,520
What was Kibutsuji doing?

245
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,150
Did you find his stronghold?

246
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,440
Hey, answer me!

247
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,240
Shut up! I asked him first!

248
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,700
First, tell us what powers Kibutsuji has!

249
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,920
Kibutsuji has sent pursuers after Tanjiro.

250
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,800
Though his purpose may simply
be to silence him,

251
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:40,760
now that Kibutsuji's given himself away
for the first time, I don't want to let go.

252
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:47,730
I also believe something's happening
to Nezuko that Kibutsuji never saw coming.

253
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,980
Can you try to understand?

254
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,990
No, I can't understand, Master.

255
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,780
If it were human, I'd be okay
with letting it live, but not a demon!

256
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,370
Not after all that we the Demon Slayers
have gone through in battle!

257
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,250
Not after so many people
have lost their lives!

258
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,290
It's unacceptable!

259
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,260
<i>What are you doing?
What are you doing?</i>

260
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
<i>You're soiling the garden!</i>

261
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,770
Master!

262
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,890
I will prove it to you myself!

263
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,610
The sheer ugliness of a demon!

264
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,570
Sanemi...

265
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,280
Hey, demon!

266
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,280
It's time to eat!

267
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,030
Sink your teeth in this!

268
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,380
No need to force yourself to hold back.

269
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,760
Just show us your true colors,

270
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,220
and I'll obliterate you right here!

271
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,220
Nezuko!

272
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,810
Shinazugawa, it's no good
doing it in the sunlight.

273
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,980
We have to go into the shadows,
or the demon won't show its face.

274
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,190
Master,

275
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,320
please forgive this discourtesy.

276
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,830
Stop it!

277
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,330
Come on out, demon!

278
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,340
Look, it's the human blood
you love so much!

279
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,170
<i>I can't breathe!</i>

280
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,920
<i>I can't move!</i>

281
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,460
Nezuko!

282
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,360
PREVIEW

283
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,940
Imagine, Shinazugawa falling victim
to a head-butt by a mere rookie.

284
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,740
That was a mighty fine head-butt!

285
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,780
Yeah! The sound it made was flamboyant!

286
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,580
How painful it must've been...
Namu Amida Butsu.

287
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,870
But the way that boy stood up
to a Hashira was so brave!

288
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,370
What is this, a free-for-all?

289
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:20,210
You know I could've dodged it
if Tomioka hadn't gotten in the way!

290
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,540
Excuses, excuses.

291
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,090
I see none of you have changed.

292
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,340
And now, time for a Taisho secret!

293
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:30,050
The first one among us to speak
gets to greet the Master,

294
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,430
so we all had butterflies in our stomachs
until the Master got here!

295
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:37,730
Oh, next, Episode 23, "Hashira Meeting."

296
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,980
TO BE CONTINUED
