1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,690
How should we kill them, I wonder.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,570
I can feel the flow of power.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,570
Because of all the blood
he shared with me.

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,530
Of course we're going to
slay them vindictively.

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,120
Get down!

6
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,300
Did you decide how to kill them?

7
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,680
Vindictively, of course!

8
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:30,000
EPISODE 9:
TEMARI DEMON AND ARROW DEMON

9
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,270
You were right, Yahaba!

10
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,350
A building just appeared out of nowhere!

11
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,400
The handiwork of a Blood Demon Arts
wielder adept at hiding objects.

12
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,700
And is the demon hunter
accompanied by a demon?

13
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,780
What's going on here?

14
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,040
Isn't this fun?

15
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,500
Still, I have to say, Susamaru...

16
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,960
Your way of doing things
is so immature.

17
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,170
So careless.

18
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,710
You splattered me!

19
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,470
You splattered my kimono with dust!

20
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,140
Oh, stop whining!

21
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,770
We found them right away
thanks to my temari, so who cares?

22
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,140
And now we can have tons of fun!

23
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,280
You've gone and splattered me again!

24
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,070
You're so uptight.

25
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,740
Your kimono isn't the least bit soiled.

26
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,660
And besides...

27
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,960
Found 'em! Found 'em!

28
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,170
<i>A temari!</i>

29
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,250
<i>So, she caused all this damage</i>

30
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,460
<i>by throwing that temari?</i>

31
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,180
<i>That woman...</i>

32
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,140
<i>Is she one of Kibutsuji's minions?</i>

33
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,190
Lady Tamayo!

34
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:27,950
Yushiro!

35
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,080
Dammit!

36
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,040
Nezuko!

37
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,330
Take the lady sleeping in the back room
somewhere safe outside!

38
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,090
It's too dangerous outside!

39
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,340
We have a basement, so take her there!

40
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,670
Understood!

41
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,010
Nezuko!

42
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,600
That's one down!

43
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,230
<i>She's giving off a totally different scent
than any of the other demons!</i>

44
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,400
<i>Is it stronger?
It's a really thick scent!</i>

45
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,730
<i>It feels so heavy
once it enters my lungs!</i>

46
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,750
The demon hunter
wearing hanafuda-like earrings...

47
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,710
It's you, isn't it?

48
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,420
<i>So, I'm the one they're targeting?</i>

49
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,130
Miss Tamayo!

50
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,550
Please find a place to hide!

51
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,920
I'm the one those demons are after!

52
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,720
Tanjiro, I want you to fight
without worrying about us.

53
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,350
We'll be fine without your protection.

54
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,390
Since we're demons.

55
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,480
All right.

56
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,270
It's all over for you now!

57
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,490
<i>That temari will only swerve if I dodge it.</i>

58
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,920
<i>Of the ten forms...</i>

59
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,420
<i>The fastest thrusting technique...</i>

60
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,210
<i>Total Concentration...</i>

61
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,920
<i>Water Breathing!</i>

62
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,340
<i>Seventh Form,</i>

63
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,470
<i>Drop Ripple Thrust-curve!</i>

64
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:17,730
<i>Oh, so you thrust at the curve diagonally
to soften the temari's blow.</i>

65
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,940
<i>But...</i>

66
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,990
<i>How can that temari
move around like that?</i>

67
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,660
<i>It swerved unnaturally</i>

68
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,950
<i>when it struck Yushiro, as well!</i>

69
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,790
<i>It's not like it's spinning
in any special way, and yet...</i>

70
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
<i>What is this?</i>

71
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,960
Yushiro!

72
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,250
Yushiro!

73
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,770
La...

74
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,770
Lady Tamayo!

75
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,270
Didn't I tell you?

76
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,070
That we shouldn't get involved
with that demon hunter!

77
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,690
From the start!

78
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,490
My Blindfold technique
is still a work in progress!

79
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,780
I know you're well aware
of that yourself!

80
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,290
I may be able to conceal the presence
of buildings and people, their scent,

81
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,170
but it's not like I can mask
their very existence!

82
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,670
The greater our numbers,
the more traces we'll leave,

83
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,880
and the greater the odds
that Kibutsuji will discover us!

84
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,180
<i>Those demons got this close to us,</i>

85
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,890
<i>yet there was no scent
until we came under attack!</i>

86
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,350
<i>That was Yushiro's Blood Demon Art, huh?</i>

87
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,060
Anyone who ruins the time
I spend alone with you...

88
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,190
I despise such people!

89
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,940
I despise them with passion!

90
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,950
It's unforgivable!

91
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,120
Hey, he's babbling!

92
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,290
What fun this is!

93
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,160
What fun this is!

94
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:05,040
To be killed by me,
one of the Twelve Demon Moons...

95
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,550
You should be honored!

96
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,050
Twelve Demon Moons?

97
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,630
They serve directly under Kibutsuji!

98
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,560
<i>She grew more arms!</i>

99
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,360
Now then, let's keep playing!

100
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,400
Until morning comes!

101
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,660
Until you die!

102
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,630
<i>If I were to cast my spell now,</i>

103
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,920
<i>it would affect Tanjiro, as well.</i>

104
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,260
<i>And Yushiro needs time to prepare
to switch to attack mode.</i>

105
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,510
<i>But if this goes on...</i>

106
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,060
<i>There it is again!</i>

107
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,100
<i>Even without hitting anything,
they changed trajectory!</i>

108
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,400
<i>If I go ahead and slash them,
it blunts the blow,</i>

109
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,650
<i>but then they hit me anyway!</i>

110
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,660
<i>Two different scents of blood.</i>

111
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,780
<i>There are two demons!</i>

112
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,000
<i>Their scent tells me where they are!</i>

113
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,960
<i>But...</i>

114
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,670
Miss Tamayo! Yushiro!

115
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,170
<i>It's no good!</i>

116
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,300
<i>I don't have time to protect them!</i>

117
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,180
We'll be healed soon enough!

118
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,680
So don't worry!

119
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,850
Hey! Moron demon hunter!

120
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,980
If you look at the arrows,
you can tell which direction they're going!

121
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,730
Dodge the arrows!

122
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,520
Arrows?

123
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,820
Seriously, you can't even see them?

124
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,360
I'm going to lend you
my sense of sight!

125
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,820
That should at least enable you
to behead that temari woman!

126
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,630
<i>I can see now!</i>

127
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,220
<i>She was using these arrows to control...</i>

128
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,970
<i>...the trajectory of the temari!</i>

129
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,520
Thanks, Yushiro!

130
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,680
I can see the arrows now, too!

131
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,020
Then, hurry up and defeat her!

132
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,310
Nezuko!

133
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,980
Nezuko, let's go outside!

134
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,190
Take care of the demon up in the tree!

135
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,200
I'm the one you want to take on!

136
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,540
The demon hunter
wearing hanafuda-like earrings...

137
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,130
No question.

138
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:57,050
I'm going to bring
that head of yours to him.

139
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,550
What fun this is!

140
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,560
<i>Nezuko, how much longer?</i>

141
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,830
<i>They're gone!</i>

142
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,410
Water Breathing...

143
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,130
Third Form, Flowing Dance!

144
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,300
Miss Tamayo!

145
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,810
Are these two demons
closely related to Kibutsuji?

146
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,480
Most likely.

147
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,270
Then, I'm going to extract blood
from them for sure!

148
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,990
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

149
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,990
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

150
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,870
<i>I have two favors to ask of you.</i>

151
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,590
<i>One, permission to study
your sister's blood.</i>

152
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,510
<i>Two, to retrieve
blood samples from demons</i>

153
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,390
<i>as closely related to Kibutsuji
as possible.</i>

154
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,390
<i>By "demons closely related to Kibutsuji,"</i>

155
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:33,640
<i>I meant demons whose powers are more
on par with that of Kibutsuji himself.</i>

156
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,610
<i>It won't be easy to extract blood
from such demons.</i>

157
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,490
Third Form, Flowing Dance!

158
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,660
Miss Tamayo!

159
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,160
Are these two demons
closely related to Kibutsuji?

160
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,830
Most likely.

161
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,600
You think you're going to extract
blood from us?

162
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,060
I don't know what you're scheming,

163
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,900
but I won't allow you
to do anything to displease him!

164
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:24,110
If you think you can extract blood
from us Twelve Demon Moons,

165
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,030
then have at it!

166
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,780
Watch your back!

167
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,160
Don't let your guard down for a second!

168
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,000
If those two really are Twelve Demon Moons,

169
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,960
then they're undeniably more formidable
than any other demon you've killed until now!

170
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,090
Right! Understood!

171
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,210
Watch my back, don't let
my guard down for a second,

172
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,340
undeniably...

173
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,880
until now...

174
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,640
Right! I'll do my best!

175
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,760
Lady Tamayo!

176
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,680
Let's use those two as decoys
and escape!

177
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,890
I'm just kidding!

178
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,780
Don't stir up dust like that.

179
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,530
So filthy!

180
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:24,840
<i>She grew new arms
in such a short time!</i>

181
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,180
<i>She can regenerate way faster
than those Final Selection demons!</i>

182
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,600
I'm going to bring
that head of yours to him.

183
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,230
Nezuko!

184
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,240
Now then, why don't you both die at once?

185
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,410
Are you okay, Nezuko?

186
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,290
Hey, Demon Hunter!

187
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,670
You get rid of that arrow man first!

188
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,630
We'll take on the temari woman
with your sister!

189
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,260
Understood!

190
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,760
Nezuko, whatever you do,
don't push yourself too hard.

191
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25,900
I'm counting on you.

192
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,190
<i>I swear...</i>

193
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,030
<i>I'm going to extract their blood!</i>

194
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,370
<i>If it means the medicine will be perfected
even a minute sooner,</i>

195
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,450
<i>I'll gladly fight any demon!</i>

196
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,370
<i>I'll fight and win!</i>

197
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,290
<i>There it is!</i>

198
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,540
<i>Opening Thread!</i>

199
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,420
What a grimy little urchin you are.

200
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,300
You stay away from me!

201
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,800
<i>The thread snapped!</i>

202
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,240
<i>This hurts! I mean this really...</i>

203
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,870
<i>It seriously hurts!</i>

204
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,630
<i>A move!</i>

205
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,010
<i>Unleash a move to blunt the attack!</i>

206
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,800
Eighth Form,

207
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,260
Waterfall Basin!

208
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,410
He vanished?

209
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,540
You hurt Lady Tamayo!

210
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,880
I'll never forgive you for that!

211
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,090
Tamayo?

212
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,130
Hey, Susamaru, the one over there...

213
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,600
Wouldn't that be Tamayo the Fugitive?

214
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,390
What a great souvenir she'll make!

215
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,640
Is that right?

216
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:27,900
Idiot!

217
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,190
You mustn't kick it!

218
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,370
What fun this is!

219
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,160
What fun this is!

220
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,920
I like kemari, too!

221
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,130
Yahaba!

222
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,920
Will four heads be enough to take home?

223
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,340
No. We're taking two.

224
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,090
The demon hunter and the fugitive.

225
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,850
We have no use for the other two.

226
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,470
Nezuko...

227
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,690
<i>The bleeding isn't stopping instantly.</i>

228
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,770
<i>She's recovering so slowly.</i>

229
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,820
This medicine will help heal your leg
right away, all right?

230
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,330
<i>What should I do?</i>

231
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,040
<i>I can't lose no matter what!</i>

232
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,090
<i>But even if I can see the Opening Thread,
it won't be easy to slash him!</i>

233
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,130
<i>Any move would be pointless</i>

234
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,010
<i>unless I can land my blow
in the opening with pinpoint accuracy!</i>

235
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,770
<i>If I'm off by even a little,
the move won't be nearly as potent!</i>

236
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,650
<i>He'll only change the sword's direction
using his arrow skills!</i>

237
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,650
<i>And I hate to say it,</i>

238
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,780
<i>but those eyeballs
on his hands are creepy!</i>

239
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,650
<i>Though I hate to say it!</i>

240
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,160
<i>The speed of this arrow!</i>

241
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,040
<i>It's not going to disappear until it hits me!</i>

242
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,170
<i>And I can't slash it with my sword!</i>

243
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,920
<i>The instant the blade touches it,</i>

244
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,510
<i>I'll get blasted away
in the arrow's direction!</i>

245
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,850
<i>What should I do?</i>

246
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,030
It's all going the way I want it to!

247
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,240
Your arm's going to get twisted right off!

248
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,630
So, you eluded it by spinning in the same
direction as the Kouketsu Arrow?

249
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,630
Damn monkey!

250
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:01,090
<i>I can't take much more of his attacks!</i>

251
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,800
<i>I gotta strike back!</i>

252
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,180
<i>I gotta change the arrow's direction
without touching it directly!</i>

253
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,430
It's about time for you to die!

254
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,400
<i>Adapt your moves!</i>

255
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,530
<i>First, use the Sixth Form
to envelope the arrow!</i>

256
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,110
<i>Then use the footwork of the Third Form...</i>

257
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,830
<i>to close in on him!</i>

258
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,580
<i>Twist!</i>

259
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,250
<i>Envelope!</i>

260
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,260
<i>Twisting Whirlpool-Flowing Water!</i>

261
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,510
<i>My sword's so heavy!</i>

262
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,180
<i>But...</i>

263
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,890
<i>Second Form...</i>

264
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,020
<i>Modified!</i>

265
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,480
<i>Horizontal Water Wheel!</i>

266
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:53,930
PREVIEW

267
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:53,930
RUSTLE RUSTLE

268
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,630
Those are some powerful demons!

269
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,090
Those temari-and-arrow combination attacks
are giving me so much trouble!

270
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,300
Are you okay, Nezuko?

271
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:57,690
Today, I have a Taisho secret for you
about those demons!

272
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,110
Those two, Yahaba and Susamaru,
met for the first time today.

273
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:05,230
I hear that they became friends
chatting with each other on their way here.

274
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,990
I can't believe how much in sync
they are when they only just met!

275
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,120
Well, we can't let them beat us!

276
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,740
Nezuko, let's practice our teamwork!

277
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,500
First Form!

278
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,750
Second Form!

279
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,500
Third Form!

280
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,960
Looking good, Nezuko!

281
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,720
Next, Episode 10, "Together Forever."

282
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,600
I'm leaving the temari woman to you!

283
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,140
Let's fight together!

284
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:40,060
