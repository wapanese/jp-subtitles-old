1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,240
<i>No way!</i>

2
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,700
<i>My sword!</i>

3
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,010
EPISODE 19:
HINOKAMI

4
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,780
<i>Amazing!</i>

5
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,700
<i>He's on a different level! The force
of his stroke is in a different class!</i>

6
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,780
<i>He's head and shoulders above the rest!</i>

7
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,540
<i>He slashed that
tough-as-nails monster like tofu!</i>

8
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,040
<i>Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!</i>

9
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,210
<i>Who is this guy?</i>

10
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,210
<i>I still have goosebumps, dammit!</i>

11
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,720
Hold up a second!

12
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,140
Fight me, Mismatched Haori!

13
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,770
You beat that Twelve Kizuki!

14
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,860
And I'm gonna beat you!
That's how I've drawn it up!

15
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,480
If I can do that...

16
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,410
that'll make me the most powerful of all!

17
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,580
Go back to training, idiot.

18
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,000
What the...

19
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,870
That was no Twelve Kizuki
or anything close to one.

20
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,080
You can't even tell that much?

21
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,290
Sure I can tell!

22
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,050
I never thought that scrub could be
one of the Twelve Kizuki, either!

23
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,130
It was Tanjiro who said
it was one of the Twelve Kizuki!

24
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,800
All I did was repeat what he said, all right?

25
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,560
<i>What's going on? Did he just tie me up?</i>

26
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,020
<i>So quick!</i>

27
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,560
<i>This guy's so quick!</i>

28
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,070
Wait, you! Come back here!

29
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,950
Stay out of battle if you don't
even realize how hurt you are.

30
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,330
I can't hear you! Your voice
is too soft, and you walk too fast!

31
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,120
I said hold up a second!

32
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,870
Untie these ropes right now!

33
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,620
Hey! Hey!

34
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,630
Hey!

35
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,140
Yoo-hoo!

36
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,230
Are you all right?

37
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,820
Gramps...

38
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,240
Who are you calling "Gramps"?

39
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,740
Just now, Gramps showed up,

40
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,740
and told me not to give up.

41
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,620
You saw your life flashing before your eyes.

42
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,330
According to one theory, the reason
one sees such images just before death

43
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,170
is because you're searching
for a way to avoid death

44
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:44,180
by going through all your
past experiences and memories.

45
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,930
Well, not that I can say for sure,
since I've never experienced it myself.

46
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,350
Right, you did a good job slowing down
the poison's path with your breathing.

47
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,940
If you hadn't been able to do that,
you would've turned into a spider long ago.

48
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,240
I'll inject you with the antidote now, okay?

49
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,410
Hurry! Over here, over here!

50
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,330
Can we get them down?

51
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,910
Be careful, okay?

52
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,750
It's all good! Everyone's still alive!

53
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,020
<i>My sword got snapped!</i>

54
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,230
<i>I can't believe it!</i>

55
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,150
<i>The threads this boy is controlling...</i>

56
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,530
<i>Does this mean they're even tougher
than the body of that demon I couldn't slash?</i>

57
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,110
<i>Forgive me, Mr. Urokodaki,
Mr. Haganezuka!</i>

58
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,910
<i>Thanks to my inexperience,
my sword is now broken!</i>

59
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,620
No, this isn't the time for that!

60
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,580
<i>Think! Think!</i>

61
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,880
<i>If I can't slash those threads,</i>

62
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,050
<i>then let me get right up in his face!</i>

63
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,050
<i>It's no good!</i>

64
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,470
<i>Those threads have a life of their own,
and I can't get through their attacks!</i>

65
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,850
<i>Even though he's holding back
enough not to kill me,</i>

66
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,230
<i>he's still overwhelming me
to this degree!</i>

67
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,900
Well?

68
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,490
Do you still refuse to take back
what you just said?

69
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,490
Fine.

70
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,080
In that case,
you'll get slashed to ribbons.

71
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,330
<i>I can't dodge them all!</i>

72
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,590
Nezuko!

73
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,470
Nezuko! Nezuko!

74
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,730
You protected me! I'm sorry!

75
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,850
A girl emerged from that box
on his shoulders.

76
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,060
But she has the aura of a demon!

77
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,820
Hey, you...

78
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,740
Is that...

79
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,490
That girl...

80
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,830
Is she your sibling?

81
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,660
So what if she is?

82
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,830
<i>The wound's so deep!</i>

83
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,670
<i>Her left wrist is about to fall off!</i>

84
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,050
<i>Hurry up and heal! Hurry up and heal!
Hurry up and heal!</i>

85
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,130
Siblings...

86
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,510
Siblings...

87
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,970
The sister's been turned into a demon.

88
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,260
R-Rui?

89
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,260
Yet, she stays by his side.

90
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,480
The younger sister
protected the elder brother.

91
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,350
Risking her own life...

92
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,900
That's a genuine bond!

93
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,070
I want it!

94
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,570
W-Wait a minute!

95
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,610
Wait a minute! Please!

96
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,820
I'm your elder sister!
Don't desert me!

97
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,700
Shut up!

98
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,880
None of you ever managed
to fulfill the roles you were given.

99
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,880
Never. Not once.

100
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,390
W-Wait.

101
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,390
I was the elder sister you wanted, wasn't I?

102
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,310
Give me a chance to redeem myself!

103
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,400
In that case, go kill those people
wandering all over this mountain.

104
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,820
If you do that, I'll forgive you
for what just happened.

105
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,280
F-Fine.

106
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,200
I'll go kill them.

107
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,250
Boy...

108
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,000
Boy, let's talk.

109
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,420
Come on out.

110
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
<i>Boy?</i>

111
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,920
<i>Talk?</i>

112
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,140
The thing is, I was really moved.

113
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,930
Seeing the bond you two share
gave me the chills.

114
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,440
I doubt there are any words in this universe
that can describe how moved I was.

115
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,060
But now the only thing left
for you is death by my hand.

116
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,110
It would be sad
if it were to come to pass, right?

117
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,660
But there's just one thing.

118
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,330
Just one thing that will
let you escape that.

119
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,200
Your sister...

120
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,580
Give your sister to me.

121
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:31,250
If you hand her over without a fight,
I'll at least spare your life.

122
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,430
I have no idea what you're talking about!

123
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,640
Your little sister will be my little sister.

124
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,010
Starting today.

125
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,270
You don't actually think
I'd ever agree to that!

126
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,850
Not to mention, Nezuko's not a thing!

127
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,320
She has her own feelings and will!

128
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,530
There's no way she'll ever be your sister!

129
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,780
It's all right.

130
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,530
No need to worry.

131
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,820
Because I'll create a bond between us.

132
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
I'm stronger than you.

133
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,450
I'm talking about the bond of terror.

134
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,120
I'll teach her what will happen
if she defies me.

135
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,710
I've had enough of this crazy talk!

136
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,260
Using terror to shackle someone
hand and foot is not the bond of a family!

137
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,380
Unless you fix that basic misunderstanding,

138
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,100
you'll never get what you desire!

139
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,600
So irritating.

140
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,850
Would you mind not shouting?

141
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,020
We don't see eye to eye, do we?

142
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,900
I'll never hand Nezuko over to you!

143
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,240
That's okay, I guess.
I'll just kill you and then take her.

144
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,030
I'll cut off your head first!

145
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,740
That's the spirit!

146
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
I'd like to see you try it.

147
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:55,000
LOWER FIVE

148
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,340
That is, if you can actually defeat
a Twelve Kizuki like me!

149
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,010
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

150
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:03,010
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

151
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,350
Family...

152
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,890
A father has his role as the father,

153
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,310
and the mother has
her role as the mother.

154
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,570
The parents protect the children,

155
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:21,280
and the elder brother and sister
protect their younger siblings.

156
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,570
No matter what.

157
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,700
At the risk of their own lives.

158
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,160
The way I see it,

159
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,580
if you don't understand your own role,

160
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,500
there's no reason for you to live.

161
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,170
What about you?

162
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,840
What is your role?

163
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,550
Your role is to relinquish
your younger sister to me and disappear.

164
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,310
If you can't do that,
your only option is to die.

165
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,190
Because you can't defeat me.

166
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,190
<i>Lower Five...</i>

167
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,230
<i>Just as I thought! That power...</i>

168
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,110
<i>This kid is a true Twelve Kizuki!</i>

169
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,070
<i>It won't be easy to slash those threads.</i>

170
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,620
<i>What should I do?</i>

171
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,700
<i>With this broken sword...</i>

172
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,500
<i>If that kid's neck turns out to be
tougher than the threads...</i>

173
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,040
I don't like that look in your eyes.

174
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,630
Glittering like that...

175
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,630
What a fool you are.

176
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,250
Don't tell me...

177
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,300
you think you're going to beat me?

178
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,510
Nezuko!

179
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,810
All right, I've taken her now.

180
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,520
Now, do you recognize
what your own role is?

181
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,980
Let her go!

182
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,650
But I told you I'd spare your life,
at least, if you didn't defy me.

183
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,500
Nezuko's gone!

184
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,460
Nezuko!

185
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,350
Stop that hollering.

186
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,770
I'm sure that's not enough to kill her.

187
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,310
After all, she's a demon.

188
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,230
But it looks like I'll have to teach her
a lesson after all.

189
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,570
I'm going to let her bleed for a while.

190
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,990
If she still doesn't learn to be docile,

191
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,490
I'll just leave her like that until daybreak...

192
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,950
and let her roast a bit.

193
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,660
You let Nezuko...

194
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,410
Let her go!

195
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,270
Look, you...

196
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,520
I'm sure I'm mistaken, but...

197
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:04,190
You don't think that if you get close enough
to me, you can chop off my head, do you?

198
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,700
Fine by me. Here. Give it a shot.

199
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,710
<i>The blade...</i>

200
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,670
<i>won't go through!</i>

201
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,800
Didn't I tell you?

202
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,430
You have no chance against me.

203
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:41,770
My body is more durable
than any thread I manipulate.

204
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,190
If you can't even slash those threads,

205
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,150
you don't have a chance in hell
of slashing my neck.

206
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,290
<i>S-So powerful.</i>

207
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,630
<i>His power is on a whole different level
than any other demon I've fought!</i>

208
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,010
<i>So, this is a Twelve Kizuki's...</i>

209
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,340
<i>The power of a demon
closely related to Kibutsuji?</i>

210
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,430
You're making too much noise.

211
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,850
Quiet down a bit.

212
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,770
Stop that!

213
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,110
I'm your elder brother now.

214
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,530
Enough of that infernal wailing.

215
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,080
<i>Calm down! Don't get emotional!</i>

216
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,790
<i>If you keep this up,
you'll be playing right into his hands!</i>

217
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,920
Did she pass out?

218
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,460
Is she asleep?

219
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,840
This demon has a unique aura.

220
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,680
There's something about her
that's not like the rest of us.

221
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,800
Interesting.

222
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,560
<i>Concentrate!</i>

223
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,350
<i>Control your breathing!</i>

224
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,980
<i>Unleash the most precise, final Form!</i>

225
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,480
<i>Total Concentration...</i>

226
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,320
You still don't realize how futile it is?

227
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,370
<i>Water Breathing!</i>

228
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,700
<i>Tenth Form!</i>

229
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,750
<i>Constant Flux!</i>

230
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,340
<i>I slashed them!
I was able to slash the threads!</i>

231
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,800
<i>Gathering force with each rotation...</i>

232
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,300
<i>This could be trouble.</i>

233
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:36,970
<i>I can do it!</i>

234
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,060
<i>If I can keep closing the distance
between us, I can defeat him!</i>

235
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,400
Hey...

236
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,110
You don't think these threads
are at maximum strength, do you?

237
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,320
<i>Blood Demon Art...</i>

238
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,740
<i>Cutting Thread Cage.</i>

239
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,070
I have no more use for you.

240
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,320
Goodbye.

241
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,740
<i>No good!</i>

242
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,330
<i>I can't slash these threads!</i>

243
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,410
<i>I'm still not getting enough spin!</i>

244
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,540
<i>These are giving off a totally different
scent than the other threads!</i>

245
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,670
<i>But I can't afford to lose no matter what!</i>

246
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,460
<i>I'm gonna die!</i>

247
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,590
<i>I'm gonna lose!</i>

248
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,510
<i>I'm...</i>

249
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,910
<i>Father...</i>

250
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,870
<i>Tanjiro...</i>

251
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,000
<i>Breathe.</i>

252
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:52,340
<i>Get your breathing under control
and become Hinokami.</i>

253
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,020
<i>Tanjiro?</i>

254
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:04,770
<i>Look.</i>

255
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,730
<i>It's your father's kagura dance.</i>

256
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,230
<i>Our family works with fire,</i>

257
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,650
<i>so to ward off injuries and disasters,</i>

258
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,030
<i>we offer this dance to Hinokami,
along with our prayers, on New Year's Day.</i>

259
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,620
<i>Hey, Mother...</i>

260
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:33,210
How can Father dance like that in the snow
for so long when he's so frail?

261
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,550
<i>I bet my lungs would freeze.</i>

262
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,600
<i>There's a breathing technique.</i>

263
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,480
<i>A way to breathe so that you won't exhaust
yourself, no matter how much you move.</i>

264
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,060
<i>Breathe?</i>

265
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,900
<i>Right.</i>

266
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,690
<i>If you can master the correct way to breathe,</i>

267
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,320
<i>you'll be able to dance forever, too.</i>

268
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,160
<i>The cold won't bother you, either.</i>

269
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,910
<i>Tanjiro,</i>

270
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,950
<i>if nothing else, make sure
this kagura and these earrings</i>

271
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,500
<i>get passed down to you uninterrupted.</i>

272
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,920
<i>That's what I promised.</i>

273
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,300
<i>Hinokami Kagura...</i>

274
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,350
<i>Dance!</i>

275
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,560
<i>The threads...</i>

276
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,600
<i>Don't stop!</i>

277
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,190
<i>Keep running!</i>

278
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,940
<i>If you stop now,</i>

279
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,980
<i>it'll bring on the repercussions
of forcibly switching</i>

280
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,700
<i>from Water Breathing
to Hinokami Dance Breathing!</i>

281
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,490
<i>When that happens,</i>

282
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,200
<i>I'll be immobile for a while!</i>

283
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,160
<i>That's why I gotta do it now!</i>

284
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
<i>Run!</i>

285
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,960
<i>You gotta protect Nezuko!</i>

286
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,550
<i>This guy...</i>

287
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,480
<i>I see the Opening Thread!</i>

288
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,020
<i>You gotta take him down now!</i>

289
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,030
<i>Even if it means...</i>

290
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,530
<i>getting slashed by him at the same time!</i>

291
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,990
<i>Nezuko...</i>

292
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,580
<i>Nezuko...</i>

293
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,450
<i>Wake up, Nezuko.</i>

294
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,370
<i>You have to save your brother.</i>

295
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,170
<i>I know you can do it now, Nezuko.</i>

296
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,000
<i>Do your best.</i>

297
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,470
<i>Please, Nezuko.</i>

298
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,020
<i>Or your brother will be killed, too!</i>

299
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,730
<i>Blood Demon Art...</i>

300
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,900
<i>Exploding Blood!</i>

301
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,580
<i>No way!</i>

302
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,500
<i>The threads burned and snapped!</i>

303
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,790
The bond between Nezuko and me...

304
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,790
can't be...

305
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,800
severed by anyone!

306
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:13,870
PREVIEW

307
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:13,870
RUSTLE RUSTLE

308
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:06,240
I wonder why I suddenly remembered
the Hinokami Kagura at that moment.

309
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,860
Thanks, Father.

310
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,200
Thanks to that, I was able to slice
through that demon's neck with my blade!

311
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,450
Thanks to you, too, Nezuko!

312
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:17,580
This week, I have a Taisho secret
about the Kamado Family!

313
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:22,170
After every festival, Father and Mother
would always toast rice crackers for us.

314
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:27,460
Those were good times, making
loud cracking noises while we ate them!

315
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,800
Thanks, Nezuko.

316
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,720
This is no time
to bask in memories, right?

317
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,850
Next, Episode 20, "Pretend Family"!

318
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,770
Did I actually... defeat a Twelve Kizuki?

319
