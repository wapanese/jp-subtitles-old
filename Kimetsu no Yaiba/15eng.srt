1
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,770
Tanjiro...

2
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,530
Listen to me...

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,620
Demon Slayer Corps
is not something you'd join for fun!

4
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,500
Guys like you gotta be purged!

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,750
Immediately!

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Don't ever underestimate the Corps!

7
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,390
WISTERIA

8
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,030
Nezuko!

9
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,990
Nezuko!

10
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,750
Nezuko!

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,170
Nezuko!

12
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,050
Zenitsu! Stop following her already!

13
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,060
Tan... ji... ro!

14
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,810
Let's be friends, Tanjiro!

15
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,650
Zenitsu! Don't keep chasing us! I beg you!

16
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,820
Oh, don't be like that, Tanjiro!

17
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,490
Nezuko!

18
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,950
- Tanjiro!
- Stop!

19
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,370
Nezuko!

20
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,160
Tanjiro!

21
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,830
Man, I'm hungry.

22
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,080
Pardon me, sir.

23
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,470
Those clothes of yours
are quite soiled, I see.

24
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,850
I'll clean them for you,
so please wear these in the meanwhile.

25
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,770
These are pleasant to the touch
and quite comfortable.

26
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:44,280
How does tempura for dinner sound?

27
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,660
You know, something
covered with batter and fried.

28
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,040
Hey, wait up!

29
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,380
Come back here, Nezuko!

30
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,970
Wh-What was that for?

31
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,720
Hold up! Hold up!

32
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,520
Stop chasing us, Inosuke!

33
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,020
Tanjiro!

34
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:20,030
EPISODE 15:
MOUNT NATAGUMO

35
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,450
You're fully healed.

36
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,600
North-northeast! North-northeast!

37
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,310
Your next mission is north-northeast!

38
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,480
The three of you are to go to Mt. Natagumo!

39
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,070
Head to Mt. Natagumo!

40
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,580
We're heading out now.

41
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,450
Thank you for everything.

42
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,090
Now then, for good luck.

43
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,960
Thank you so much!

44
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,680
What do you think you're doing, old hag?

45
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,100
What are you, a moron?

46
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,690
She's striking sparks for good luck!
It's a purification ceremony!

47
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,360
Because we're gonna go
on a dangerous mission!

48
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:47,450
Always live your lives
with great pride.

49
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,820
I wish you luck in battle!

50
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,300
"Great pride"? "Luck in battle"?

51
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,470
What does that mean?

52
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,890
<i>Jeez, this guy is totally clueless.</i>

53
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,850
Well, yeah, now that you mention it,
it's kind of difficult.

54
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,480
"With great pride"...

55
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,610
I guess it means
that you know your place

56
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:26,690
and that you behave properly
so that you're never ashamed of yourself.

57
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,910
And the old lady
is also praying for our safety.

58
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,030
So, what is this "place"?

59
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,160
What do you mean, "never ashamed"?

60
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,330
Well, it's...

61
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,670
What exactly does it mean
to "behave properly"?

62
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,920
Why in the hell would that old hag
pray for our safety anyway?

63
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,470
She has nothing to do with us.
Then, why?

64
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,010
She has no clue
what her own place is, does she?

65
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,270
<i>He sped up!</i>

66
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,480
I won't get beat!

67
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,980
Wait up!

68
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,450
Hold up!

69
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,330
Would you mind waiting a second?

70
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,580
Zenitsu? What's wrong?

71
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,040
I'm scared, all right?

72
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,080
Now that we're nearing
our destination, I'm so scared!

73
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,670
Why the hell is he sitting?

74
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,630
How creepy is that?

75
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,090
Who are you to talk, Pig Face?

76
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,850
Don't tell me you're not getting
any vibes from that mountain!

77
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,610
Still, what good will it do
to just sit there?

78
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,030
I told you, he's creepy.

79
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,570
I am not in any way creepy!

80
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,240
I'm normal! I'm the normal one!
You guys are abnormal!

81
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,830
What? What's wrong?

82
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,880
Hey...

83
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,630
What is this smell?

84
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,050
Tanjiro!

85
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,670
Come on!
Don't leave me here by myself!

86
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,760
Don't leave me!

87
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,440
H-Help me.

88
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,320
He's got our uniform on!

89
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,490
He's a Demon Slayer!

90
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,030
Something must've happened!

91
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,370
Hold up!

92
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,580
Are you all right?

93
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,160
What happened?

94
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,670
They were attached to me, too!

95
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,840
Help me!

96
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,730
I'm going.

97
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,780
I'll go on ahead.

98
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,530
You can follow me, shivering.

99
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,530
This is making me hungry.

100
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,620
Inosuke...

101
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,870
This is challenging enough for you, right?

102
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,790
Let's go!

103
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,400
What the hell is this?

104
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,990
A spider web?

105
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,410
Jeez, this place is full of spider webs!

106
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,870
What a pain!

107
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
You're right.

108
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,790
Inosuke?

109
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,300
What do you want?

110
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,260
Thanks.

111
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,760
You said you'd come with me,

112
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,340
and I felt encouraged.

113
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:07,100
That twisted, ominous scent
I was picking up from the mountain...

114
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,890
It made me freeze a little.

115
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:11,810
Thanks!

116
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,570
<i>These are pleasant to the touch
and quite comfortable.</i>

117
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:25,410
<i>Always live your lives with great pride.</i>

118
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,450
<i>I wish you luck in battle!</i>

119
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,370
Inosuke...

120
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,630
Let's go.

121
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,680
We've come for backup.

122
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,100
I'm Tanjiro Kamado, Rank Mizunoto.

123
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,860
Mizunoto...

124
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,110
Mizunoto?

125
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,950
Why didn't they send a Hashira?

126
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,700
No matter how many Mizunoto
they send, it won't help!

127
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:04,950
It's pointless!

128
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,790
Inosuke!

129
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,870
Shut up!

130
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:14,250
As far as pointlessness goes,
your existence itself has no point at all!

131
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,090
Now, tell us what's going on,
you spineless fool!

132
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,050
Who the hell is this guy?

133
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,380
Did you forget that I have seniority?

134
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,890
Th-The crow gave us the order!

135
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,890
And ten of us Demon Slayers came here.

136
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,650
Not long after we entered the mountain,

137
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,150
the Slayers...

138
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,460
The Slayers started killing each other!

139
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,430
I...

140
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,810
I...

141
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,440
You did well to return.

142
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,530
So, most of my children
have been slaughtered?

143
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,450
We might find
the Twelve Kizuki there, then.

144
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,710
It seems I'll have to send in
some Hashiras.

145
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,590
Giyu...

146
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,720
Shinobu...

147
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,680
- As you wish!
- As you wish!

148
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,680
If only humans and demons
could get along.

149
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,020
Don't you agree, Tomioka?

150
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,310
Impossible...

151
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,730
as long as demons eat humans.

152
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,030
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

153
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,030
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

154
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,910
<i>I wonder if they hate me.</i>

155
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,580
<i>Would you really leave your friend
by the roadside?</i>

156
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,170
<i>Wouldn't you talk him through it
if you were friends?</i>

157
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,630
<i>If they both tried to talk me into going,</i>

158
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,050
<i>Zenitsu...</i>

159
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,670
<i>Zenitsu...</i>

160
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,220
<i>I would've gone, okay? Sure I would.</i>

161
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,720
<i>But no, off they went on their merry way
up that scary mountain.</i>

162
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,480
<i>Poor me left alone here...</i>

163
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,150
"Sulking isn't going to do you any good.
You have to go help your friends now."

164
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,410
Lucky you, you don't have
a care in the world.

165
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,910
You don't understand a thing
about humans, do you?

166
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,160
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

167
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,170
You're not cute at all!
I mean it! Not that side of you!

168
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,670
Seriously, you've got zero charm!

169
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,510
I mean, look how cute Nezuko is,
and she's a demon!

170
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,670
But you're a sparrow,
and you're so vicious!

171
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,760
He took Nezuko with him!

172
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,140
Why did he have to take
my precious Nezuko with him?

173
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,520
Damn Tanjiro!

174
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,150
Don't take a young girl into danger!
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

175
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:27,190
Nezuko!

176
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,040
What is this sound?

177
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,660
There it is again.

178
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,540
It's this sound again!

179
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,210
I heard this sound,

180
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,550
and the next thing I knew,
everyone started killing each other!

181
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,090
Where's it coming from?

182
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,640
These guys are all morons!

183
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:38,390
They don't know that it's taboo
for us Demon Slayers to fight each other!

184
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,310
No, that's not it!

185
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,810
They're not moving normally!

186
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,140
They're being manipulated
by something!

187
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,440
All right.

188
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,400
I'm gonna slash them to ribbons!

189
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,650
You can't do that!

190
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,650
They're alive!

191
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,780
Some of them are still alive!

192
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:55,660
Besides, we can't harm
the corpses of our teammates!

193
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,160
Stop denying me

194
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,160
at every turn!

195
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,350
<i>A strange sweet scent from his back!</i>

196
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,900
It's threads!
They're being manipulated by threads!

197
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,400
Slash the threads!

198
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,160
I already knew that
before you caught on!

199
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,290
<i>Where's the location
of the demon controlling them?</i>

200
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:51,460
<i>What's this? What an irritating odor!
Though it was just for a second!</i>

201
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,380
<i>What's this?</i>

202
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,060
<i>Spiders!</i>

203
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,730
<i>So, the spiders are attaching them
to the puppet strings?</i>

204
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,570
<i>That means...</i>

205
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,330
Now then, my sweet little dolls...

206
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,460
Dance until your arms and legs fall off.

207
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,920
It's not good enough
to just cut the threads!

208
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,380
The spiders are just gonna stick
more puppet strings onto them!

209
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,420
So...

210
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,010
<i>That acrid smell again!</i>

211
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,380
<i>What is it anyway?</i>

212
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,430
<i>It's being carried here by the wind!</i>

213
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,100
So, all we gotta do
is kill those damn spiders, huh?

214
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,430
That would be impossible!

215
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,100
Those spiders are tiny,
and I'm sure there are tons of them!

216
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,070
We gotta find the demon
who's controlling them!

217
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,240
It's no good, Inosuke!

218
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:04,700
Inosuke, if you have some kind of power
that can pinpoint the demon's location,

219
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,250
then help me out!

220
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,620
This weird smell has been flowing in,

221
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,000
and my nose isn't working great!

222
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,590
And also, um...

223
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,710
It's Murata!

224
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,210
Murata!

225
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,970
Murata and I will find a way to deal
with the people being controlled!

226
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,220
Inosuke, you...

227
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,820
Don't disturb my family's peaceful life.

228
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,070
<i>He's floating!</i>

229
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,120
<i>No.</i>

230
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,870
<i>He's standing on the threads!</i>

231
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,750
<i>What did he mean by "family"?</i>

232
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,000
Mother will kill you all right away.

233
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,500
Mother?

234
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,810
Damn you!

235
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,140
Where the hell do you think
you're going? Fight me! Fightâ€”

236
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,650
Inosuke!

237
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,400
Why did he show up anyway?

238
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:20,650
That kid probably isn't the demon pulling
the puppet strings! So, first, let's...

239
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,280
Okay, okay, okay!

240
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,030
I hear you, all right?

241
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,200
You want me to find
where that demon's at, right?

242
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,330
Shut up already, Forehead!

243
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,340
<i>Beast Breathing Seventh Form,</i>

244
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,340
<i>Spatial Awareness!</i>

245
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,780
Found it!

246
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,410
There you are!

247
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,380
I won't let anyone get in our way.

248
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,510
The five of us are going to live
in bliss as a family.

249
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,800
No one can break our bond.

250
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:07,150
PREVIEW

251
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,190
Whoops-a-daisy!

252
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,440
Nezuko!

253
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,820
Tanjiro!

254
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,150
Where are you?

255
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,280
"First, let's calm down
and listen to the sounds around us!"

256
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,660
Nezuko's in danger!

257
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,660
Stop chirping and help me
find her, Chuntaro!

258
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,910
"I told you to calm down!"

259
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,410
"Now, it's time for a Taisho secret!"

260
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,540
"My real name is Ukogi."

261
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,880
"That's because my favorite food
is ukogi rice."

262
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,090
"But Zenitsu hasn't noticed yet,
so all I get is beans."

263
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,170
What are you so mad about?
Here, eat this and calm down.

264
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,670
"It's an ukogi rice ball!"

265
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,920
When you're done with that,
help me look, okay?

266
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,720
I mean, Nezuko's in danger!

267
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,470
"He's seriously worried."

268
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,220
Nezuko!

269
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,180
"I guess this is why
you just can't hate the guy."

270
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,810
Next, Episode 16,

271
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,810
"Letting Someone Else Go First."

272
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,060
