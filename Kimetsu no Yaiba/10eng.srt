1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,190
It's about time for you to die!

2
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,700
<i>Twist!</i>

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,370
<i>Envelope!</i>

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,370
<i>Twisting Whirlpool-Flowing Water!</i>

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,630
<i>My sword's so heavy!</i>

6
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,300
<i>But...</i>

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,010
<i>Second Form...</i>

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,130
<i>Improved,</i>

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,600
<i>Lateral Water Wheel!</i>

10
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,990
EPISODE 10:
TOGETHER FOREVER

11
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,130
<i>I did it!</i>

12
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,420
<i>The Whirlpool move loses force
when it's not underwater!</i>

13
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,130
<i>But thanks to my opponent's attack,
it gained power,</i>

14
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,090
<i>and I was able to envelope the arrows!</i>

15
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,430
Damn!

16
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,020
Curse you! Curse you! Curse you!

17
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,230
All I had to do
was bring back your head,

18
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,020
and I would've won his approval!

19
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,230
I'll never forgive you!

20
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,480
I'll never ever forgive you!

21
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,030
Shoving my face into this vile dirt!

22
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,780
You're going down with me!

23
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,040
<i>Oh no! He's gonna get me!</i>

24
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,000
<i>I'm getting pulled by a force
stronger than the arrows he's hit me with!</i>

25
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,670
<i>I gotta unleash move after move
and go on the defensive,</i>

26
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,170
<i>or my body's going to get smashed!</i>

27
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,130
Fourth Form,

28
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,550
Striking Tide!

29
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,010
<i>The pressure is bearing down on my body,</i>

30
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,930
<i>and I can't swing my sword!</i>

31
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,270
<i>Unleash one!</i>

32
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,100
<i>Unleash a move!</i>

33
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,730
<i>Not here!</i>

34
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,190
<i>Don't let yourself get beat!</i>

35
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,940
<i>Second Form,</i>

36
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,650
<i>Water Wheel!</i>

37
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,490
<i>Waterfall Basin!</i>

38
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,200
Water Surface Slash!

39
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,210
Drop Ripple Thrust-curve!

40
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,870
Whirlpool!

41
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,500
<i>I've never made this
many consecutive moves before!</i>

42
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,920
<i>It feels like both my arms
are about to get torn off!</i>

43
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,090
Nowhere near enough!

44
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,510
More...

45
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,470
Suffer more!

46
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,230
<i>How many more times?</i>

47
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,150
<i>How many?</i>

48
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
<i>Don't think about it!</i>

49
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,400
<i>Just keep unleashing moves!</i>

50
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,570
<i>Keep throwing them out!</i>

51
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,290
Not yet!

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,040
It's still not enough yet!

53
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,270
<i>Nezuko...</i>

54
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,480
<i>Miss Tamayo...</i>

55
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,020
<i>Yushiro...</i>

56
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,690
<i>I've got a broken rib and leg.</i>

57
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,580
<i>N-No good!</i>

58
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,160
<i>I'm too exhausted to grip my sword!</i>

59
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,630
<i>I gotta get over there!</i>

60
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,630
<i>There's still one more demon!</i>

61
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,800
<i>I'll be there soon!</i>

62
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,220
<i>I'll be there soon!</i>

63
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,140
<i>So be safe, all right?</i>

64
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,390
<i>Please...</i>

65
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,890
<i>be safe!</i>

66
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,530
Ridiculous!

67
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,070
It's child's play for me
to evade a linear attack like this!

68
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,160
Locating you is a breeze, as well!

69
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,580
<i>The same goes for you!</i>

70
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,250
<i>No matter how well
you might conceal yourself,</i>

71
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,460
<i>I can see you clear as day!</i>

72
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,810
What fun this is!

73
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:14,810
Hey you!

74
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,690
Don't be so rash
just because you're immortal!

75
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,940
Wh-What's wrong?

76
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,740
What do you think you're doing?
Here it comes!

77
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,750
Look at her.

78
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,290
Lady Tamayo...

79
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,510
<i>You little brat!</i>

80
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,220
<i>You little brat!</i>

81
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,020
<i>So, now you can kick
my temari back at me?</i>

82
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,940
<i>How insolent!</i>

83
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,710
You damn brat!

84
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,210
Unbelievable.

85
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,470
Lady Tamayo, is this...

86
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,090
I used a healing serum on her.
Nothing more.

87
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,600
Made exclusively for demons.

88
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,770
It doesn't make one physically stronger.

89
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,480
What we're seeing
is Nezuko's own power.

90
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,190
Without devouring human blood...

91
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,190
Solely on her own...

92
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,320
Nezuko is gaining strength at a rapid rate.

93
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,000
<i>However, her opponent
is also formidable.</i>

94
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,420
<i>If she were to go all-out,
Nezuko wouldn't stand a chance.</i>

95
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,050
<i>I've got to...</i>

96
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,050
<i>do something.</i>

97
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,680
You're an amusing little girl!

98
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,100
This time, I'm going all-out against you!

99
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,600
I wonder how long you can hold out!

100
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,400
Twelve Kizuki demon girl there.

101
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,740
You're in my way!
Step back, you damn fugitive!

102
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,530
Just tell me one thing please.

103
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,580
Are you aware of Kibutsuji's true identity?

104
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,330
What the hell did you say?

105
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,290
That man is nothing but a coward.

106
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,340
He lives in constant fear of something.

107
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,590
Stop it!

108
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,510
Damn you! Stop it!

109
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,760
Do you know why it is
that demons can't band together?

110
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,560
The reason why demons
cannibalize each other?

111
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,400
It's to prevent other demons
from banding together and attacking him.

112
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,190
He manipulates demons to act this way.

113
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,610
Demons like you.

114
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,700
Shut up!

115
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,370
Shut up, shut up!

116
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,870
No way is he that petty!

117
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,870
<i>Lady Tamayo...</i>

118
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,080
<i>is casting a spell.</i>

119
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,540
The power he wields is mind-blowing!

120
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,250
There's no one stronger than him!

121
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,880
Not Lord Kibutsuji!

122
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,390
You've uttered that name
out loud, haven't you?

123
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,900
That will trigger the curse.

124
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,900
<i>Magical Aroma of Daylight.</i>

125
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,400
<i>It weakens its target's brain functions,</i>

126
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,320
<i>rendering that person
unable to lie or keep secrets.</i>

127
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,660
<i>It's immensely potent, Lady Tamayo!</i>

128
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,170
I do feel sorry for you, but...

129
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,420
farewell.

130
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,800
Please forgive me!

131
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,420
Please forgive me!

132
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,180
I'm begging you! Please!
Please forgive me!

133
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:43,030
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

134
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:47,040
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

135
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,230
Did she just die?

136
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,900
She will die momentarily.

137
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,360
That's the curse.

138
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:02,660
Her physical body will be destroyed
by Kibutsuji's cells still in her body.

139
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,780
In general,

140
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,410
battles between demons are futile.

141
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,410
It's pointless.

142
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,920
Because they can't inflict
fatal wounds on each other.

143
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,760
Only sunlight and the swords
of the Demon Slayers can do so.

144
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,720
Kibutsuji alone appears
to be able to destroy demon cells.

145
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,690
Don't go inhaling Lady Tamayo's spell!

146
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,730
It's harmful to the human body!

147
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,110
You got that?

148
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,740
Tanjiro...

149
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:46,120
She is not one of the Twelve Kizuki.

150
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,620
The Twelve Kizuki have numbers
engraved on their eyeballs,

151
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,370
but this demon doesn't have one.

152
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,130
Most likely,

153
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,670
the other demon isn't a member
of the Twelve Kizuki, either.

154
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,300
They're too weak.

155
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,920
Too weak?

156
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,180
At that level?

157
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,510
If Lady Tamayo says so,
there's no mistake.

158
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,770
Still, who knew
there were such stupid demons?

159
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,810
She physically injured Lady Tamayo.

160
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,100
She got exactly what she deserved.

161
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:27,070
I hope this blood will be instrumental
in developing the healing serum.

162
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,950
I'm going to take care of Nezuko.

163
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:36,460
Not only did I medicate her,
she also inhaled my spell inadvertently.

164
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,380
I'm so sorry.

165
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,960
Don't move a muscle!

166
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,460
You're on your own now!

167
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,760
I don't want to leave
Lady Tamayo's side!

168
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:46,970
Not for a second!

169
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,980
DESTROY

170
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,980
Ma... ri...

171
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,610
Mari...

172
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,030
Mari...

173
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,250
Here's your mari.

174
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,540
Play with me.

175
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,460
Play with me.

176
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,340
<i>You're just like a little kid.</i>

177
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,890
<i>Even though you must've murdered
scores of people.</i>

178
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,700
<i>You were deluded into thinking
you were in the Twelve Kizuki.</i>

179
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,620
<i>Deceived... Compelled to fight...</i>

180
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,250
<i>And now,</i>

181
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,630
<i>you were killed by the Kibutsuji curse.</i>

182
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,380
<i>There's no salvation.</i>

183
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,380
<i>Even after you die,
not even your bones will remain.</i>

184
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,930
<i>Is this the price you pay
for killing others?</i>

185
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,280
<i>Kibutsuji...</i>

186
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,070
<i>This is how that man treats
even those who revere him!</i>

187
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,120
<i>He's a true...</i>

188
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,450
<i>demon!</i>

189
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,720
Miss Tamayo!

190
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,100
Yushiro?

191
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,720
Over here! Over here!

192
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,350
Not that you need to come at all.

193
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,060
But if you want to,
then get down here.

194
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:06,860
Yushiro!

195
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,400
Only joking!

196
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,490
Hurry down, then, Tanjiro!

197
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,240
Oh, right!

198
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,960
Nezuko!

199
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,960
I moved her to this basement,

200
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:30,460
where the sunlight won't reach her,
ahead of daybreak.

201
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,090
Nezuko?

202
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,970
Why, you!

203
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,770
Step away from Lady Tamayo!

204
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,020
That's so rude!

205
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,900
Stop it, Yushiro.

206
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,900
I don't mind at all.

207
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,400
Yes, ma'am!

208
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,860
<i>You have such a kind heart,
Lady Tamayo.</i>

209
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,860
<i>You're too beautiful to believe!</i>

210
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,910
Cut... that... out!

211
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:02,540
Nezuko has been acting in this way
since she awoke.

212
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,870
Do you think she's all right?

213
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,500
There's nothing to worry about.

214
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,790
She's fine.

215
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:13,300
She probably thinks
you're someone in our family.

216
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,930
Cut it out!

217
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,720
Family?

218
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,260
But I thought the spell
Nezuko is under

219
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,930
causes her to see humans
as her family.

220
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,940
And Yushiro and I are demons.

221
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,940
Cut it out!

222
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,940
But Nezuko has perceived
you two as humans.

223
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,940
That's why she tried to protect you.

224
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,620
At first, I didn't like the idea
of Nezuko being under a spell,

225
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,830
but since it looks like she has
a will of her own, I'm glad thatâ€”

226
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,210
I-I'm so sorry! Nezuko!

227
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,300
Nezuko! S-Step away from her!

228
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,090
It's rude, all right?

229
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,130
Thank you...

230
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,720
Nezuko!

231
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,510
Thank you!

232
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,940
<i>Do you still wish to live?</i>

233
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:20,490
<i>Do you still wish to live
even if you're no longer human?</i>

234
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,290
<i>If this goes on, you will most likely
succumb to your illness.</i>

235
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,170
<i>However,</i>

236
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,630
<i>losing your humanity
will cause you pain and grief.</i>

237
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,550
<i>Do you still wish to live?</i>

238
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,560
Yushiro and I will leave this region.

239
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,440
We've gotten too close to Kibutsuji.

240
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,240
We must conceal our whereabouts soon
or the risk will be too great.

241
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,950
Not to mention, even if I think
I've concealed my identity,

242
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,200
when I interact with humans as a doctor,

243
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,700
people sometimes
see through me as a demon.

244
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,290
The young and the elderly
are particularly perceptive.

245
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,460
Tanjiro...

246
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,710
Yes?

247
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:18,840
Would you like us to take Nezuko in?

248
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,510
I can't give you an absolute guarantee
that she'll be safe,

249
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,520
but I believe it will be less dangerous
than taking her into battle.

250
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,770
<i>That might be true.</i>

251
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,690
<i>She's right. It would be better
for Nezuko to be in their care.</i>

252
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,300
Miss Tamayo, thank you so much
for your concern.

253
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,300
But...

254
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,680
Nezuko and I are staying together.

255
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,390
We're not going to live
apart from each other.

256
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,640
Never again.

257
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,690
Very well.

258
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,860
In that case, I wish you
long-lasting good fortune in battle.

259
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,020
All right.

260
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,280
We'll be leaving after we erase
all traces of ourselves.

261
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,910
You two get going now!

262
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,370
Right!

263
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,830
Okay, Miss Tamayo, Yushiro,
we wish you well!

264
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,210
Let's go, Nezuko.

265
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,210
Hey!

266
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,880
Don't go rushing off like that!

267
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:36,960
Tanjiro!

268
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,550
Your kid sister...

269
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,390
is a beauty.

270
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,810
South-southeast! South-southeast!
South-southeast!

271
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:00,530
Your next location is south-southeast!

272
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,740
I heard you!

273
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,610
I heard, so give me a break
and quiet down!

274
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,740
I'm begging you!

275
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,830
I got the message, so please!

276
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,120
Please!

277
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,410
Please! Please! Please!

278
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,080
Please marry me!

279
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,210
I could die any day, you know!

280
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,210
That's why I want you to marry me!

281
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:24,180
So please! Please, I'm begging you!

282
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,340
Wh-What's up with that?

283
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,390
What on earth?

284
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:13,330
PREVIEW

285
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:13,330
RUSTLE RUSTLE

286
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,650
South-southeast! South-southeast!

287
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,610
I mean, I just fought!
When can I get some sleep?

288
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,570
What? I nailed it?

289
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,580
Not that I was really trying to or anything.

290
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,950
First, it's time for a Taisho secret!

291
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,580
The Demon Slayer Corps' messengers,
the Kasugai Crows, each have a name.

292
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,380
I hear that mine is named
Matsuemon Tennouji.

293
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,000
Okay, one last impression.

294
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,300
"This is your first assignment
as a Demon Hunter!"

295
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,800
Hey! We've been fighting constantly
from the start!

296
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,640
Next, Episode 11, "Tsuzumi Mansion"!

297
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,060
This isn't really the time
for a festival, is it?

298
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,020
TO BE CONTINUED
