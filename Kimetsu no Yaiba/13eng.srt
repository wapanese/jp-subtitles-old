1
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,740
I've done a good job until now!

2
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,950
I have what it takes!

3
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,080
And not today...

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,910
or any time in the future!

5
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,870
Even if I'm broken...

6
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,010
I'll never give up no matter what!

7
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,980
EPISODE 13:
SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN LIFE

8
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,320
Where are you, Tanjiro?

9
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,650
<i>I can still hear that creepy sound.</i>

10
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,410
<i>Just be safe and sound, Tanjiro!</i>

11
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,660
Um, Zenitsu,

12
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,160
is it just me, or are we
just going around and around in circles?

13
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,200
I knew it!

14
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,420
I was getting the same feeling!

15
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,040
That's my boy, Shoichi!
I knew I could count on you!

16
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,420
All right, could you check to see
if this room is safe?

17
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,760
What the heck? All right, all right,
just stop giving me that look!

18
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,890
Fine, I'll do it myself!

19
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,480
There's nobody around.

20
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,730
Let's go this way!

21
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,360
Tanjiro,

22
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,900
please show up!

23
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,110
Th-The room...

24
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,240
just flipped!

25
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,970
<i>I can do it!</i>

26
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,470
<i>I know I can do it!</i>

27
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,810
<i>I'm a guy who gets things done!</i>

28
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,320
<i>Broken bones or not...
No matter what...</i>

29
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,070
<i>I can do it!</i>

30
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,490
<i>I can fight!</i>

31
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,450
<i>Show him how unstoppable you are!</i>

32
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,080
<i>Broken bones or not!</i>

33
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,590
<i>It's no good! Nothing's changed at all!</i>

34
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,390
<i>Spirit alone isn't gonna get me anywhere!</i>

35
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,560
<i>Your head...</i>

36
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,980
<i>Use your head, not just spirit!</i>

37
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,730
<i>Think! Think! Think!</i>

38
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,150
<i>Close call!</i>

39
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,490
<i>I barely survived that one!</i>

40
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,950
Damn! This is so annoying!

41
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,410
<i>I gotta consume some marechi!
There's no time to lose!</i>

42
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,540
<i>There isn't even time to stop and think!</i>

43
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,340
Hey you!

44
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,420
What's your name?

45
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,890
Kyogai.

46
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:47,930
Kyogai!

47
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,520
I'm not handing over Kiyoshi...
the marechi to you!

48
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,180
I'm not gonna cave!

49
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,810
I'm not giving up!

50
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,730
<i>Just give it up, will you?</i>

51
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:05,240
I'm going to get my hands
on some marechi

52
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,660
LOWER MOON SIX

53
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,030
and reclaim my place
among the Twelve Kizuki!

54
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,960
<i>Just give it up, will you?</i>

55
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,140
<i>It's so boring!</i>

56
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,150
<i>Your writing is just so boring.</i>

57
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:44,280
<i>Every last word is utter trash!</i>

58
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,410
<i>No beauty, no fragility, no impact.</i>

59
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,160
<i>Why don't you forget about writing?</i>

60
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,960
<i>It's just a waste of paper and fountain pens!</i>

61
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,420
<i>You never even step outside
anymore these days.</i>

62
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,590
<i>So no wonder you're so boring!</i>

63
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,220
<i>You should just enjoy your hobby,
playing the tsuzumi</i>

64
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,470
<i>as long as you're shut in here.</i>

65
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,600
<i>Not that you have the skills
to teach that, either!</i>

66
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,680
Out of my sight!

67
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,260
You damn insect!

68
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,010
Rapid Drumming!

69
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,600
<i>Don't tell me he can strike
that tsuzumi even faster!</i>

70
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,790
<i>The speed of these rotations
is making me dizzy!</i>

71
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,870
<i>This is bad!</i>

72
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,540
<i>What an amazing skill!</i>

73
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,880
<i>Not only that,</i>

74
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,710
<i>but now he's got five claws
instead of three!</i>

75
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,060
<i>Got it.</i>

76
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,900
<i>Because I dodged his blows
without stepping on the papers,</i>

77
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,400
<i>I now know how to move my body
without aggravating my wounds,</i>

78
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,610
<i>and how to breathe!</i>

79
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,450
<i>Take shallow breaths. Quickly!</i>

80
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,290
<i>Use that breathing technique to reinforce
the muscles around your broken leg!</i>

81
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,790
<i>And right before the claw attack,</i>

82
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,300
<i>there's the scent of mold!</i>

83
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,630
<i>Here it comes! The claw attack!</i>

84
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,890
<i>Above!</i>

85
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,180
<i>Left!</i>

86
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,260
<i>Right!</i>

87
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,640
<i>Behind!</i>

88
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,480
<i>He's evading all of my attacks!</i>

89
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,360
<i>Total Concentration...</i>

90
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,980
<i>Water Breathing!</i>

91
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,580
<i>Ninth Form,</i>

92
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,290
<i>Splashing Water Flow, Turbulent!</i>

93
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,420
<i>Minimize the landing time and area
as much as possible!</i>

94
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,250
<i>He's adapting
to the room's orientation changes!</i>

95
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,960
<i>Go! Get in there!</i>

96
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,670
<i>Within striking distance!</i>

97
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,010
<i>Forward!</i>

98
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,090
<i>Get right up in his face!</i>

99
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,850
<i>I see the Opening Thread!</i>

100
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,350
Kyogai!

101
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,100
Your Blood Demon Art was incredible!

102
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,080
<i>Ouch, ouch, ouch!</i>

103
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,210
<i>I took a deep breath by mistake!</i>

104
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,380
<i>I'm the eldest son!</i>

105
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,430
<i>The eldest son!</i>

106
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,050
Boy...

107
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,770
Answer me.

108
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,690
You think my Blood Demon Art...

109
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,980
was incredible?

110
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,950
It was amazing.

111
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,490
But...

112
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,040
I can't forgive you for killing others.

113
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,710
I see.

114
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,630
Oh, wait. I gotta get a blood sample.

115
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,690
<i>It extracted the blood.</i>

116
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,560
<i>So, it really does extract blood
automatically if you stick it in there.</i>

117
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,440
<i>That Yushiro sure is skilled,
creating something like this.</i>

118
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,660
A cat?

119
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,370
So, you're the one who's going to deliver
this to Miss Tamayo, huh?

120
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,960
There, there. Thanks!

121
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,590
Now you're all set.

122
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,630
All right, take care now!

123
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,380
Hey—

124
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:05,100
<i>I was told that under Yushiro's spell,
it would be invisible until it meowed,</i>

125
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,850
<i>and then vanish again
when it meowed a second time.</i>

126
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,390
<i>So it's true, huh?</i>

127
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,820
Where are those two?

128
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,900
I gotta search for them!

129
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,070
<i>My...</i>

130
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,410
<i>writing...</i>

131
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:32,580
<i>Your writing is just so boring.</i>

132
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,050
<i>Every last word is utter trash!</i>

133
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,220
<i>No beauty, no fragility, no impact.</i>

134
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,430
It wasn't trash at all.

135
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,650
At the very least, not to that kid.

136
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:56,360
He saw fit not to trample on it.

137
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,280
Rest in peace.

138
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,450
Both my Blood Demon Art...

139
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,960
and my tsuzumi playing...

140
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,290
have been recognized.

141
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:26,010
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

142
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:30,020
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

143
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,600
Kiyoshi!

144
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,020
Teruko!

145
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,600
Kiyoshi!

146
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,940
Teruko!

147
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,110
Kiyoshi!

148
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,190
Teruko!

149
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,740
Tanjiro...

150
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,740
Why are you throwing stuff at me?

151
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
We're so sorry!

152
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,620
The tsuzumi vanished, so we panicked.

153
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,250
I see.

154
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,590
Well, I'm glad you're safe.

155
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,260
You did a good job hanging in there.

156
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:08,970
You, too, Kiyoshi.

157
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,770
Come on, let's head outside.

158
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,520
Climb onto my back.

159
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,610
Is your leg okay?

160
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,690
Yes!

161
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,980
You just have to be brave
a little longer.

162
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,700
I'm picking up
Zenitsu and Shoichi's scent.

163
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,620
They must be outside.
Both of them safe—

164
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,410
<i>I smell blood!</i>

165
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
What's wrong?

166
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,540
Nothing.

167
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,920
Let's hurry!

168
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,970
Take this!

169
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,470
Move it!

170
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,640
Take this!

171
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,850
Draw your sword and fight me!

172
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,100
You spineless punk!

173
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,230
Tanjiro...

174
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,570
I protected it.

175
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,740
Because you said...

176
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,370
this was more important
to you than your life.

177
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,670
The thing is...

178
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:29,300
<i>I've always had really good hearing.</i>

179
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,600
<i>One time, I knew
what people said while I was asleep,</i>

180
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,350
<i>and that creeped everyone out.</i>

181
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,320
<i>I'm not hearing any more demon sounds.</i>

182
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,400
<i>Tanjiro, you defeated
that demon, didn't you?</i>

183
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:55,040
<i>I can hear you guys, and also these
weird-sounding, loud footsteps.</i>

184
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,250
...itsu! Zenitsu!

185
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,830
Zenitsu!

186
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,840
Thank goodness! Are you all right?

187
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:14,100
When the room spun around,
we got thrown outside.

188
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
We fell from the second-story window.

189
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,060
Did we now?

190
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,570
You were protecting me,
so I'm totally fine. But...

191
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,820
I'm glad to hear that.

192
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,200
So, tell me, why all the tears?

193
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,160
Now I get it!

194
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,290
I fell right onto my head, didn't I?

195
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,630
Yes.

196
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,750
Am I gonna...

197
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,210
Am I gonna die?

198
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,470
My head is starting to spin.

199
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,470
What's this? What's this? What's this?

200
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:57,220
Comin' through! Comin' through!

201
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,270
There it is again!

202
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,440
The monster boar!

203
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,190
I'm getting a demonic vibe.

204
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,070
It's him!

205
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,110
I was able to tell from his voice!

206
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,360
He's the fifth survivor!

207
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,240
During Final Selection,

208
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,450
he was the first to rush up the mountain,

209
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,080
and then he came down
from the mountain before anyone else!

210
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,620
Mr. Impatient!

211
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,960
Hey, found it!

212
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,630
Cut it out!

213
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,140
Who the hell are you?

214
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,060
Get out of the way!

215
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,520
I'm Zenitsu Agatsuma!

216
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,270
I'm with the Demon Slayer Corps like you!

217
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,270
Demon Slayer Corps?

218
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,070
Then I shouldn't have to tell you!

219
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,530
We gotta get rid of that thing!

220
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,860
Now, get the hell out of my way!

221
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,240
I'm not moving!

222
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,780
This is Tanjiro's—

223
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,330
Don't argue with me!

224
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:04,460
In that case, I'm gonna demolish him
and the box together!

225
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,500
I said move it!

226
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,380
Why, you...

227
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,880
Inside this box...

228
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,550
Inside this box is something
I'm not letting you touch!

229
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
Something precious to Tanjiro!

230
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,100
Oh, hey, come on!

231
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,770
What are you talking about?

232
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,190
There's a demon inside that box!

233
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,940
Don't you get that?

234
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,110
I've known that from the very start!

235
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,490
I knew he was traveling with a demon.

236
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,370
Because the sounds demons make
aren't anything like human sounds.

237
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,740
But...

238
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:45,960
I can pick up a sound so gentle and kind
from Tanjiro, it makes me want to cry.

239
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,090
So kind, I don't think I've ever heard
anything like it before.

240
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,680
All living creatures
constantly give off sounds.

241
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,010
The world is full
of all these sounds spilling out.

242
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:05,270
Breathing, heartbeats,
the sound of blood circulating...

243
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,100
By listening closely,

244
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,110
I could tell what someone was thinking.

245
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,610
But I've been deceived by others
time and time again.

246
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:21,240
I've always believed
in whomever I wanted to believe in.

247
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,870
Tanjiro, despite being a Demon Slayer,
is traveling with a demon.

248
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,750
But I'm sure he has a reason for that.

249
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,720
And that it's a reason I can accept!
I believe that!

250
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:38,930
I...

251
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,270
I'm going to ask Tanjiro directly myself!

252
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,140
So, you...

253
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,310
You can just back off!

254
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,860
Let go of me, dammit!

255
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,120
You're so annoying!

256
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,540
You're not laying a finger on that!

257
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,050
That's something...

258
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,840
precious to Tanjiro!

259
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,260
You're not touching it until he gets back!

260
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,680
Damn you!

261
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,060
Take this!

262
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,940
Move it!

263
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,360
I won't!

264
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,910
Take this!

265
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,450
Move it!

266
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,580
Take this!

267
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,790
Draw your sword and fight me!

268
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,040
You spineless punk!

269
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,920
Tanjiro...

270
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,550
I protected it.

271
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,680
Because you said...

272
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,310
this was more important to you...

273
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,560
than your life.

274
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,520
After all that bluster,

275
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,490
you won't even draw your sword,
you dumbass?

276
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:23,490
If you're a fellow Demon Slayer,
then let's see you fight!

277
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:34,380
If you're not gonna fight,
get the hell out of my way!

278
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,260
Move it!

279
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,730
Enough!

280
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,940
If you won't get out of my way,

281
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:00,030
I'll just have to skewer you
along with that box!

282
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,160
Knock it off!

283
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:17,670
Knock it off!

284
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:15,910
PREVIEW

285
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:15,910
RUSTLE RUSTLE

286
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,690
That was some Blood Demon Art

287
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,610
to make the room spin around and still attack!

288
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,240
Maybe the closer a demon is to Kibutsuji,

289
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,620
the more potent and troublesome
his Blood Demon Art will be.

290
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,200
I wonder if I really have
a chance of beating them.

291
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,250
Now, it's time for a Taisho secret!

292
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,830
Kyogai, the demon in that house, is a fan
of "The Legend of the Eight Samurai,"

293
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,500
and I hear that he was writing
a biographical novel of his own.

294
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,720
Right, this is no time to be banged up!

295
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,180
Next, Episode 14,
"The House with the Wisteria Family Crest."

296
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,800
Your big brother's gonna kick some butt!

297
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,640
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
I forgot about my broken bones!

298
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,020
TO BE CONTINUED
